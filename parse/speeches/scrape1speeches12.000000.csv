Why it takes legislation to enforce common sense is beyond me. Just like in the business world, the VA and its employees must be held accountable for their actions.  Three weeks ago, I hosted a veterans townhall in Swainsboro, Many of the complaints and concerns shared with me were about wait times. One thing no one has enough of is time, especially our veterans. For far too long, veterans have waited for care at their own expense. This is unacceptable.  It is our responsibility to not only take care of, but provide the best possible care to our servicemen and -women. Getting rid of bad and incompetent actors is a great place to start.

3681,topic-id,535,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the past and future of the United States Navy, the strongest and the best Navy in the world.  On this day, March 27, President George Washington signed an ``Act to Provide a Naval Armament'' authorizing the construction of six frigates, which includes the USS Constitution, the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat.  The passage of the Naval Act of 1794 was, in part, a response to threats to American merchant ships from the Barbary pirates in the 223 years later, the men and women of the U.Navy continue to protecting the goods and information we transport via ships and undersea cables to our overseas trading partners.  This includes securing the resources and services we import to fuel our industries. Paraphrasing Admiral Jonathan Greenert: the mandate of the Navy in modern times is to be in the right place, at the right time, ready and able to respond.  The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review signed by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel--may I add a Nebraskan--states that in order to support this mission, we need to ``continue to build a future Fleet that is able to deliver the required presence and capabilities and address the most important warfighting scenarios.''  In that light, I look forward to the commissioning of the USS Omaha this fall, and to congratulating the crew of the newest addition to the United States naval fleet.  The USS Omaha, LCS-12, is an Independence-class littoral combat ship, and the fourth ship to bear the name USS It is a chain dating back to the commissioning of a sloop-of-war in 1869. The last USS Omaha was a nuclear attack submarine that served in the Navy from 1978 to 1995.  According to the Omaha World-Herald, a great source of intelligence, the ship is the sixth in line of Independence-class littoral combat ships with a futuristic trimaran design that sits high above the water.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work once compared it to a Klingon Bird-of-Prey ship in the movie ``Star Trek.'' The ship was christened on December 19, 2015, by Susie  The ship's Latin motto is derived from its namesake, the city of Omaha, It translates to ``Courageously in Every Enterprise,'' which denotes her crew's willingness to brave any future endeavor.                              {time}  1930  While I am very proud of the future crew of the USS Omaha, I am equally proud of the members of the Nebraska Navy League and their counterparts for supporting the Navy's missions, their personnel, and their families. In an effort to strengthen the connection between the USS Omaha and the citizens it serves, the Nebraska Navy League has committed to bringing several members of the crew to our community each year. This endeavor helps to enhance the morale of the Active Duty personnel and their families, but it also helps to inform the American public of the importance of a strong United States  The people in the Second Congressional District are proud to have a fantastic new ship bearing the name of It honors our community and the many men and women from Omaha and the surrounding metro area who proudly serve in the United States Armed  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgH2456-4.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,27.0,April

3730,topic-id,615,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.King of New York for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017. I thank Mr.King of New York and Chairman McCaul for working with me to introduce this legislation.  The purpose of my bill is to clarify and enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of Fusion The bill amends the existing statute to update the Department's responsibilities for sharing information with State and local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the National Network of Fusion  After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created fusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security information to State and local law enforcement officials, as well as fuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence.  Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security coordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78 State and locally owned fusion centers across the country.  I would especially like to recognize the work of the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center, PaCIC, which is run by the Pennsylvania State In 2015, our fusion center received the Fusion Center of the Year Award from the National Fusion Center  I want to congratulate the men and women working at PaCIC for their commitment to security and public safety. They share vital information with police departments that keep officers and our citizens safe.  PaCIC provides intelligence and information products to over 1,200 local, State, and Federal criminal justice agencies, while also working with over 6,000 private and public center partners to also share information to help protect critical infrastructure and key resources.  Our center has been nationally recognized for their training and compliance with issues of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. They produce documents that highlight threats and scams that target Pennsylvanians, and help make sure that local police departments have information on public events, ranging from the Little League World Series to the visit of Pope  A significant amount of progress has been made by States and fusion centers within the national network to improve information sharing and analytic support. Many centers, including PaCIC, provide all crime, all hazard support. They also maintain a focus on our homeland security missions, including protecting critical information and sharing suspicious activity reporting.  H.642 recognizes the progress and focuses on enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's responsibility to support, share information, and coordinate with fusion centers. This includes improving coordination with other Federal departments that provide better operational intelligence, reduce inefficiencies, and coordinate nationwide suspicious activity reporting.  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, I have heard concerns raised by law enforcement in my district and elsewhere about the lack of information and coordination from several DHS component agencies, including ICE and To address this issue, I included language in this bill to direct the Department to ensure that each component is providing information and personnel to work with fusion centers.  To address the need for better accountability, language is included throughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and State Homeland Security Advisers in carrying out the assigned responsibilities.  Additionally, there is a requirement for the Department to submit a report to Congress on their efforts, including the components to support fusion centers, and specifically report on how they are meeting the requirements that are set forth in this bill.  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill so that we can add important requirements and accountability in how the Department of Homeland Security interacts and shares information with key State and local stakeholders.

3531,topic-id,430,"Mr.Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing. It is hurting more people than it is helping. It is forcing Americans to buy insurance they don't like, they don't need, and cannot afford. Premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent this year. Deductibles[[Page H1956]]are skyrocketing. Nearly 70 percent of U.counties have only two or fewer insurers offering plans on their State's exchanges. Thirty-four percent fewer doctors and other healthcare providers accept ObamaCare insurance compared to private insurance. Congress must act decisively to protect the American people from this failed law.  The American Health Care Act is an important step in this process. While not perfect, it moves us significantly in the right direction, which is why The Wall Street Journal says that the legislation would be ``the most consequential social policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996.''  I am also encouraged that the committees of jurisdiction are, as we speak, entertaining amendments in regular order that will improve the legislation. But even without these amendments, the American Health Care Act is a dramatic improvement over  The bill ends job-killing individual and employer mandates.

CFPB Regulations Hindering Manufactured Housing Financing  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1955-3.txt,2238,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,January
3532,topic-id,384,"Mr.Speaker, last month, a hospital worker in Paducah, Kentucky, applied for a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent down payment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month--plenty to cover the all-in housing costs of $670 per month. The payment for his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent, but he was unable to get financing. He contacted his local banks and credit unions, but they did not finance manufactured homes.  This hospital worker from Kentucky can't get financing because of the very entity that was created to protect consumers--the Consumer Financial Protection That is right, the Federal Government is protecting people right out of homeownership. Consumers are protected so much they can't even purchase a manufactured home.  Lenders have stopped making manufactured housing loans because of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations. Even worse, current owners are having to sell their homes below market value to cash buyers because potential buyers can't find financing.  And this isn't just anecdotal. Government statistics prove that CFPB rules have prevented credit-worthy consumers from accessing affordable financing that would allow them to purchase manufactured homes. According to 2014 HMDA data, manufactured home loan volume for loans under $75,000 decreased in the first year that these regulations went into effect.  This is proof that many lenders who were previously willing to make manufactured home loans are no longer capable of doing so under Dodd-These are exactly the kinds of top-down bureaucratic Federal regulations that my constituents in rural Kentucky are fed up with.  The CFPB has the authority to make adjustments to its requirements, but it has refused to act even when the data shows that consumers are being harmed.  A bipartisan group of Members of this body came together in the last Congress to do what the CFPB has refused to do. The House voted three times to make these changes so that people seeking to purchase manufactured homes would have access to financing.  I invite my colleagues to join me in this fight for consumers. Let's work together to make these changes to the CFPB and to their regulations and stop Federal bureaucrats from hurting modest income Americans who need access to affordable housing and deserve access to the American Dream of homeownership.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1955-3.txt,2238,FALEOMAVAEGA ENI FA'AUA'A HUNKIN VA CLINIC,2017.0,9.0,April

3476,topic-id,2745,"Mr.President, I wish to begin by congratulating our new Senator from California for her first speech in the I know it is not her first official speech, but she is here on this important night to talk about the state of public education in this country and this confirmation process. So I thank her for her remarks. I also want to thank the ranking member of the Education Committee of the Senate, Senator Murray from Washington State, who is here tonight as well. I know she has been here all day today and was here all day on Friday as well, because the set of issues we are discussing are so important.  As I sat here listening to the Senator from California, I was thinking about the work we have done recently on the committee on which we both serve--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--with the leadership of Chairman Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, and Ranking Member Senator Murray, from Washington State, to pass a new reauthorization of No Child Left Behind--a bill that if you said: Let's have a rally on the steps of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the same, not a single person in the United States would have shown up for that rally. It took this body 7 years--7 years after we were supposed to reauthorize No Child Left Behind--to actually do the work. But when we did the work, we were able to get it through the committee once unanimously. This committee has on it, among other people, Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Senator Rand Paul from the Commonwealth of They seldom agree on anything, but they agreed on that bill. We got it out of the committee almost unanimously, and then passed it on the floor of the Senate with over 80 votes. It passed with a huge bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and it was signed by the It was 7 years too late, but we were able to do it in a bipartisan way--which is what education issues should always require. It is a shame that tonight we are here with a partisan divide because of the selection President Trump has made to lead the Department of  So I just want to say thank you again to Senator Murray for her leadership.  Since our first days before we founded this country, education has been an American value. In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, colonists recognized their collective responsibility to educate their children. They wrote into law that children, both wealthy and poor, must be taught to read and write, and to learn a skill, like blacksmithing, weaving, or shipbuilding, to secure their economic independence. As democracy took root in early America, public education became not just an ideal but an imperative. An enlightened public, the Founders believed, was essential to self-government.  Thomas Jefferson wrote that we must ``educate and inform the whole mass of the people. . . . They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.''  Benjamin Franklin believed: ``The good education of Youth has been esteemed by wise Men in all Ages, as the surest Foundation of the Happiness both of private Families and of Common-wealths.''  With education, the common man would be able to select leaders wisely and fight back against the tyrannical instincts of those in power. He would be able to understand, maintain, and protect his rights, so that government could not usurp authority and devolve into despotism.  In a country ``in which the measures of Government receive their impression so immediately from the sense of the Community as in ours,'' George Washington explained, ``knowledge . . . is proportionally essential.''  This set of beliefs represented a fundamental break from the aristocratic ways of the old world. A republic that was ``for the people'' and ``by the people'' required an educated people.  With this new world also came a new conviction that individuals could determine their own future, that their birth or circumstance no longer limited their potential. This foundational idea grew to become the American dream: Every child, regardless of who her parents are or where she came from, could achieve an education and grow up to achieve a better life.  Over time, as our Republic became more and more democratic, as the right to vote and lead was secured by African Americans and women, education became the fundamental means by which Americans sought to secure their liberty and their equality.  Perfecting our Union by expanding education has not come without struggle, but we have often succeeded because we have recognized that symbiotic relationship among the needs of our country and the success of individual Americans and our aspiration to move forward. This included the need for a universally literate workforce in the 1830s and the creation of Horace Mann's Common School Movement; the demand at the turn of the 20th century to replace out-of-date Latin schools with progressive high schools that prepared students for the emerging industrial workforce; the challenge of providing World War II veterans with a career path and the creation of the GI bill for college education; and the need to tear down the barriers of Jim Crow school systems in the 1950s and 1960s.  Too often, as a country, we confronted these challenges too late and at the tragic expense of our fellow American's potential. ``With all deliberate speed'' has proven not fast enough, especially for children living in places like the Mississippi Delta and South Central Los  At each of these turning points, we have asked for more from our public schools. To their credit, our educators--teachers, specialists, and principals--have risen to the challenge, many times much sooner than the rest of us. They have helped us build a nation admired for our forward progress, for opportunity, and for equality.  That is the American ideal from our founding until today. I come to the floor tonight with a sense of urgency because our generation is at risk of being the first American generation to leave less opportunity to our children than we inherited. If we do that, we will have broken a fundamental American promise to our children.  In our Nation, education is supposed to be at the heart of opportunity, but today our education system fails far too many kids. Schools that once were engines of opportunity and democracy are now too often traps for intergenerational poverty.  As a result, only 3 out of 10 children born to very low-income families in the United States will make it into the middle class or higher. Only 4 out of 100 will make it to the top 20 percent of income earners. Already, the United States has less social mobility than at least 12 other developed countries--among them, Canada, Japan, and  In America, children growing up in poverty here hear 30 million fewer words than their more affluent peers by the time they reach kindergarten. In fourth grade, only one in four of our students in poverty is proficient in math, and fewer than that can read at[[Page S725]]grade level. As few as 9 will receive a bachelor's degree by age 25.  As a nation, we are falling behind the rest of the world. When George Bush, the son, became President in 2000, we led the world in college graduates. Today we are 16th in the world. American 15-year-olds score lower than their peers in 14 countries in reading, 36 countries in math, and 18 in science.  Much of the rest of the developed and developing world is figuring out how to produce more and more educated citizens, while the United States is standing still and therefore falling behind. We must refuse to accept outcomes that are a tragedy for our children, a threat to our economy, and an immeasurable risk to our democracy.  To make change, we need to stop treating America's children as if they belong to someone else. To meet our children's needs, we must invent a 21st century approach to education, a system for the delivery of free, high-quality education built for the future, not for the past.  We must have the courage to shed old ways of thinking, abandon commitments to outdated approaches, and explore new ideas. This reenvisioned system must focus like a laser on what is best for kids, not what is convenient for adults. It must be comprehensive and integrated from early childhood to postsecondary education.  A 21st century system of public education must set high expectations, demand rigor, and create meaningful accountability. This system must embrace different kinds of schools and create a culture that is focused on continuously learning from each other--among traditional, charter, and innovation schools, and across districts, cities, and  We need to change fundamentally how we prepare, recruit, place, train, retain, and pay teachers and school leaders. That entire system belongs to a labor market that discriminates against women and said you have two professional choices: one is being a teacher and one is being a nurse. So why don't you come teach Julius Caesar every year for 30 years of your life in the Denver Public Schools, where we are going to pay you a wage far lower than anybody else in your college class would accept.  Those days are gone. We had discrimination in the labor market that actually subsidized our school system because very often the brightest students in their class--very often women--had no other career options and therefore were willing to teach.  That whole system needs to be transformed in the 21st century. We have 1.5 million new teachers whom we have to hire over the next 6 to 8 years in this country, and we have no theory about how to hire them or how to keep them. Fifty percent of the people are leaving the profession now in the first 5 years.  This new system of public education should embrace technology and personalized learning. We must create space for innovation in school autonomy, and we must also provide choice to parents and kids, but our goal is not, and should not be, school choice for choice's sake.  For a youngster in a low-income family, there is no difference between being forced to attend a lousy school and being given the chance to choose among five lousy schools. That is no choice at all. It is certainly not a meaningful one. The goal is, and must be, to offer high-quality education at every public school so parents can choose among grade schools in their neighborhood and throughout their cities and towns.  We must refuse to accept the false choice I have heard over and over again during this confirmation process that you either support school choice in whatever form or you defend the status quo, just as we must reject the idea that you cannot support public schools and advocate for change.  This old rhetoric and manufactured political division will not work for our kids. We need to rise above the narrow, small politics that consume our attention and permit and prevent us from making tough choices. Instead, we need to recognize that a 21st century education can and should look very different than a 19th century education or a 20th century education, and no matter what approach or method of delivery, it must be high quality.  The good news is, we know it is possible to reverse course and create meaningful change. Several cities around the country have already begun creating roadmaps to this 21st century approach. Denver is one of them.  In Denver, we made a deal--create a public choice system that authorizes charters, creates innovation schools, and strengthens traditional schools. We empowered schools through autonomy and worked to create a culture of shared learning and innovation focused on all ships rising. We demanded quality, and we implemented strong accountability. High-performing schools were rewarded, replicated, and expanded. Low-performing schools had to be improved or be shut down.  We made tough decisions. We closed schools. I sat in living rooms, classrooms, and gymnasiums with parents urging them to demand more from the school district, even if it meant that their child had to go to a different school. Along with concerned citizens, teachers, and principals, I went door-to-door to enroll kids in new schools.  Denver created innovative teacher and school leadership policies. We tried to rethink the tired model of the last century and create a new career for this one. That is why today in Denver you will find teachers teaching other teachers and being paid for it, knowing that their job is not only to educate their students but also to improve the honorable craft of teaching so our kids can achieve even more.  We used the levers of Federal law, strong accountability, and civil rights protections as the backbone of change. We cannot have made the changes we did had it not been for the national demand for improvement in our schools--the civil rights impulse that underlies the Federal involvement in public education, as well as the courage of our community to demand something better for our children. Denver has begun to see the results of hard work.  Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools students' achievement growth increased faster than the State's in both math and This outcome was achieved by students qualifying for free and reduced-price lunch and also students not qualifying for free and reduced-price lunch. Latino and African-American students' achievement in English and math grew faster than their counterparts' throughout the  Sixty-one percent more students graduated in 2016 than in 2006. We have a long way to go, but I would suspect that if we could say of every urban school district in America that we are graduating 60 percent more students this year than we were a decade ago, we would be feeling a lot better about where we are headed as a country. In Denver, over that time, the overall ontime graduation rate increased almost 30 points, and the ontime graduation rate for Latino students has doubled since 2007.  Since 2006, Denver Public Schools' enrollment has increased--many cities have lost enrollment--over 25 percent, making it the fastest growing urban school district in America, partly because Denver has grown but also because parents and kids and families have now found schools that are responsive to their families' needs and supportive of their children.  I am the first to say, and I always will be the first to say, that we still have a lot of work to do to make sure the ZIP Code Denver's children are born into doesn't determine the education they receive. But cities like Denver are moving in the right direction. Now we need to move a nation in the right direction.  Tonight, as we stand here in this marbled Chamber among these statues that tie us to our past, I am thinking of our future. I am thinking of the millions of poor children across time zones our Founders could not have imagined, heading home after a long day at school, shifting their backpacks of books to find a comfortable spot, sharpening pencils for math and pastels for art, clearing a space on a busy dinner table for homework. I am thinking about children teaching other children, older brothers and sisters teaching their younger siblings, expecting that they will have more opportunity than their parents. I am remembering the naturalization ceremony I attended just last Friday at Dunn Elementary School in Fort Collins, CO, where Kara Roth's fifth grade class welcomed 26 new Americans from 13 countries to the United I am thinking about[[Page S726]]teachers and principals and students--while we are here speaking--who are up tonight, planning for tomorrow, and hoping for a future that allows them to review at home before they teach tomorrow the best lessons for teaching the productive and destructive forces of volcanoes, what Scout learns in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' or the mathematical reasoning that calls on us to invert the second fraction when we divide. I am imagining a country that fulfills our generational responsibility by providing quality early childhood education to every American family who wants it--a K-12 school for every child to which every Senator would be proud to send his or her child or grandchild and access to college and skills training that prepare students for economic success without shackling them to a lifetime of debt.

Representative Pallone--I want to give some credit to him--has been a champion of following the eye-opening effects of Superstorm He has worked tirelessly on this legislation since October 2012.  In total, the Sandy storm resulted in roughly $74 billion in damages in the U.alone. Sometimes we forget the magnitude of that storm. Damage to power and communications infrastructure, it knocked out about 25 percent of the cell sites in its path. In some of the hardest-hit counties, 50 percent of those sites were down.  When the networks go down, public safety communications and emergency response services are threatened. In order for the networks to get back up and running, telecommunications providers need access to critical resources and permission to enter the disaster area.[[Page H580]]  The chaos immediately following a major disaster makes it challenging to obtain resources and entry to the affected area. What we saw after Sandy were communication providers being turned away from the disaster area and denied resources because they were not considered essential to the recovery effort. This bill seeks to change that.  In the wake of Sandy, and as a result of repair workers being barred from the recovery effort, communication networks remained offline for hours and, in some cases, days longer than need be. This left those who were still vulnerable in the disaster area without critical information and no means to call for help.  There are numerous entities that are essential for the rescue and recovery phase following a disaster. The affected area needs power. Water is critical. The bill would clarify that communications networks are also an essential service.  Whether it be wireline, mobile telephone, Internet, radio or television, communication services play a key role in facilitating recovery. In some cases it can be the difference between life and death. By defining these types of providers as essential, telecommunication companies will be granted the access and resources needed to get their networks back online.  The bill would also require the FCC to conduct a study on the feasibility and benefits of making WiFi access points available to the general public to access 911 services during times of emergency.  I would also like to recognize that the original version of this bill included a number of wireless provisions designed to increase preparedness. These provisions were removed, however, because the five largest wireless carriers voluntarily adopted these provisions.  H.588, in its current form, combined with the voluntary framework established by the wireless carriers, leaves us with a strong, bipartisan bill that will improve the resiliency of our Nation's communications infrastructure to avoid a recurrence of the widespread and extended service outages, as experienced in the aftermath of Superstorm  I thank our colleagues from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for working with us on this bill, and I urge the support of my colleagues for the legislation.

3607,topic-id,1434,"Mr.President, as we finished the vote just hours ago, I could not help but notice a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle high-fiving each other. That image stays with me as I stand here now. It saddens me. There is no cause for celebration in what happened in the Senate just hours ago. No one should sleep well tonight. No one should underestimate the magnitude of what happened here. Damage was done to our democracy, in fact, to the institutions that are the pillars of our democracy--the United States Supreme Court and the Senate itself.  Today is, indeed, one of my saddest days in the Sadder than anything is the damage that has been caused to the Supreme Court by eroding and undermining trust and respect for an institution that has power only because of its credibility with the American people. It has no armies or police force; all it really has is the confidence and respect of the American people.  Today, raw political power has been exercised to break the rules and norms of this body so that a nominee could be confirmed. The only way that he could be confirmed was, in fact, to wreck the rules, a nuclear option that will have enduring fallout and rippling repercussions, perhaps for years come.  For myself, I would state unequivocally that I hope we will work together on issues where we have common ground, where we can reach common solutions on infrastructure, on tax reform, on immigration issues.  No one should make light of the potential fallout, as there is in any nuclear explosion, from this action today.  The Senate has broken with decades of bipartisan practice when it comes to the U.Supreme The practice and the tradition was that Presidents of either party would consult with Members of both parties in this body before making a nomination so as to ensure a mainstream nominee, and that nominee would be in the mainstream even before his or her selection so that there was some modicum of comity and so that respect for this body, as well as the courts, would be preserved.  My concern is that the contagion of partisanship will infect the court system as a whole. All of the nominations to lower courts, as well as the appellate courts, will be affected.  My hope is that we can avoid that truly cataclysmic outcome, a nuclear explosion, in some ways even more deafening and damaging than the one used today would be because our courts are the bulwark of our democracy. An attack on our courts is an attack on the only check we have against tyranny and autocratic erosion of those rights. That is why the nonpartisanship of our courts is so important.  The Supreme Court, of all our courts, should be above politics. In fact, that is why the 60-vote rule for the Supreme Court was so important. The Supreme Court is different: nine Justices appointed for life to the highest Court in[[Page S2400]]the land. In some ways, it is an anachronism in our democracy--unaccountable, unelected, sitting for life with the power to strike down actions of elected representatives and an elected Executive by issuing words on paper without the direct means to enforce them, depending only on respect and credibility from the American people. To approve nominees by a razor-thin majority is a disservice to the Court and to our democracy.  Supreme Court Justices do more than just follow the law; they have to resolve conflicts in the law and differences among the lower courts where they disagreed and, in fact, ambiguities in the statute, where there is lack of clarity, where this body is unable to reach consensus and, in effect, decides to agree, to the extent it can, and leave some question to administrative agencies, which rightly are entitled to respect, as they implement the law.  Confidence and trust are essential, and we have undermined it today. Our Republican colleagues have gravely damaged it by the actions taken today.  I have urged my colleagues to reject Neil Gorsuch because I believe he is out of the mainstream, because he failed to answer questions about whether he agreed with established core precedents essential to rights of privacy and equality under the law, because he has a judicial philosophy that would involve substituting judgments of courts for administrative agencies and banning the Chevron doctrine, and because he favored in many of his actions, opinions, writings the interests of corporations over individual rights.  We have debated the merits of this nominee. I believe that his repeated evasion of the questions that were put to him leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that he passed the Trump test; that he is not a neutral caller of balls and strikes; that he is, in fact, an acolyte of the of the rightwing groups that screened and suggested his name; and that he would carry out not only the Trump litmus test to overrule Roe v. Wade, strike down gun violence provisions, but also other unknown decisions that would implement that far-right conservative agenda. We can debate whether that view is right or wrong.  Today is one of my saddest days in the It goes more to the institutions that have been demeaned and degraded: the U.Senate and the Supreme My hope is that maybe it will be a turning point. Maybe we can reconstruct the sense of bipartisanship and comity that existed for so many years. Many of my colleagues on the other side have expressed to me their misgivings about what was done today.  The obstruction of Merrick Garland's nomination was, as one of my colleagues put it, ``the filibuster of all filibusters.'' It was another step in a continuing progression, culminating in today's outcome that very much betrays the spirit and values of a bipartisan selection of Supreme Court nominees because the highest Court in the land is different.  I had the extraordinary honor to clerk for a Justice on the U.Supreme Court, Harry Blackmun, who was appointed by a Republican, President Richard He grew as a Justice and surprised a lot of people. He, no doubt, surprised the President who appointed him. And that is what happens to really extraordinary men and women who serve on our courts as well as in the U.Senate; they grow in the job.  Choosing a U.Supreme Court Justice is one of the most solemn and important duties that a President has, and confirming her or him is one of the most important tasks we have in this body.  Even at the most difficult and contentious times, as I served then as a law clerk and as I have litigated since then for several decades, I have never doubted that judges were working in good faith to uphold the rule of law. Whether they ruled my way or not, I believed that we were working to try to be above partisan politics and uphold the rule of law and do the right thing to follow the law.  The Supreme Court does more than follow; it leads. Today's vote is a significant challenge to that principle and perhaps the most difficult that we have seen in recent history. It threatens to exact profound damage on the confidence and trust the American people have in the Supreme Court and perhaps in the courts overall, and that is a danger for all of us.  In my view, when the history of this time is written, there will be two heroes: the free press that has uncovered abuses and wrongdoing despite opposition from many powerful forces, and our independent judiciary that has upheld their right to do it and, also, the rights of countless Americans in many areas of law.  Today's action threatens those two institutions in our society. It undermines our rules. It would not have happened without a choice made by the Republican leadership that they were willing to break the rules to achieve this result.  I am determined to try to move forward in a positive way, in legislation as well as in protecting and enhancing our courts, giving them the resources they need to do their job--and law enforcement, the resources needed to uphold the rule of law.  We cannot hold the Supreme Court hostage to any ideology, and that is a lesson from today and from the past year that we should all heed.  Mr.President, I will continue to talk about this topic because I believe it is so profoundly important to our Nation, but for now, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cassidy).

3536,topic-id,909,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Record Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment Act, or REDEEM This bill would take meaningful steps towards allowing returning citizens to obtain employment. As President George Bush said in his 2004 State of the Union Address, ``America is the land of the second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.'' The REDEEM Act would help provide people with that second chance after their incarceration. I thank Senator Paul for his tireless work with me on the REDEEM  In the last 30 years, the number of incarcerated people in the United States has drastically increased. Since 1980, the federal prison population alone has grown by nearly 800 percent and American taxpayers are left paying for the bill. In fiscal year 2014, the Bureau of Prisons accounted for a quarter of the Department of Justice's budget at $6.9 billion. Our bloated criminal justice system wastes priceless human potential and fails to make our communities safer. It also fails to adequately prepare the over 600,000 people each year who are released from prison for their return to the community.  A high number of Americans living in our communities have criminal convictions. About 70 million people in the United States have been arrested or convicted of a crime. That means almost one in three adults in the United States has a criminal record. In fact, in our Nation's Capital alone, an estimated 1 in 10 DC residents has a criminal record.  The American Bar Association has identified over 44,500 ``collateral consequences''--or legal constraints--placed on what individuals with records can do once they are released from prison. Of those, up to 70 percent are related to employment.  Today, a criminal conviction is a modern-day scarlet letter that, because of the so-called War on Drugs, has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. For example, African-American men with a conviction are 40 percent less likely to receive an interview. And the likelihood that Latino men with a record will receive an interview or be offered a job is 18 percent smaller than the likelihood for white men.  To increase public safety, reduce recidivism, and protect the future of our children, I am proud to re-introduce the REDEEM This bill would incentivize states to raise the age of original jurisdiction for criminal courts to 18 years old. Trying juveniles who have committed low-level, nonviolent crimes as adults is counterproductive. They do not emerge from prison reformed and ready to reintegrate into school, nor will the criminal record they have help them obtain a job.  This change in law is important for protecting our children's futures. For kids in the dozen states that treat 17- and even 16-year-olds as adults, no longer would getting into a school yard scuffle result in an adult record that could follow an individual for the rest of their life, restrict access to a college degree, limit job prospects, or lead to likely recidivism.  The bill would enhance Federal juvenile record confidentiality and provide for automatic expungement of records for kids who commit nonviolent crimes before they turn 15 and automatic sealing of records for those who commit nonviolent crimes after they turn 15.  The bill would ban the very cruel and counterproductive practice of juvenile solitary confinement that can have immediate and long-term detrimental effects on a youth's mental and physical health. In fact, the majority of suicides by juveniles in prisons occur when young people are placed in solitary confinement. Other nations even consider it torture.  The REDEEM Act would, for adults, offer the first broad-based federal path to the sealing of criminal records. A person who commits a nonviolent crime will be able to petition a court for sealing of the record, so their future job prospects are not harmed.  And the bill would enhance the accuracy of criminal justice records. Employers requesting a background check from the FBI will be provided with only relevant and accurate information thanks to a provision that will protect job applicants by improving the quality of the Bureau's background check.  Think about this: 17 million background checks were done by the FBI in 2013, many of them for private providers, and upward of half of them were[[Page S2366]]inaccurate or incomplete, often causing people to lose a job, miss an economic opportunity, and be trapped with few economic options other than to reoffend in order to feed a child or pay a debt.  The bill helps guard against gender disparities in federal juvenile delinquency proceedings. Additionally, it would ensure that programming and services are distributed evenly among male and female juveniles. Oftentimes, juvenile females receive less programming and resources than males because of the smaller size of the female prison population. This is wrong and this bill take a step forward to fix the problem.  Finally, the REDEEM Act would lift a ban on two critical Federal benefits: the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy The intent of those Federal programs is to keep low-income families from going hungry. Yet those convicted of drug felonies lose the right to obtain such benefits. Once an individual has paid his or her debt to society, a path to the reinstatement of those benefits should be available.  I am proud to introduce the REDEEM Act today. Again, I thank Senator Paul for partnering with me on this bill. I urge this bill's speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2365.txt,2194,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,4.0,March
3538,topic-id,702,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2017, also known as the Fair Chance This criminal justice reform bill is designed to help returning citizens successfully obtain jobs and reintegrate into society. As the nation's largest employer, it is time the Federal Government leads by example and delays the criminal history inquiry until later in the hiring process. I thank Senator Johnson for his leadership on the Fair Chance Act, and I deeply appreciate Senators Baldwin, Ernst, Brown, and Portman for joining the bill as original cosponsors.  Everyone deserves the dignity of work and the opportunity for a second chance to earn a living. But far too many Americans who return home from behind bars have to disclose convictions on their initial employment application or initial job interview that often serve as insurmountable barriers to employment. This legislation would ensure that people with convictions--who have paid their debt to society and want to turn their lives around--have a fair chance to work.  By encouraging Federal employers to focus on an individual's qualifications and merit and not solely on past mistakes, the Fair Chance Act would remove burdensome and unnecessary obstacles that prevent formerly incarcerated people from reaching their full potential and contributing to society. It would also help reduce recidivism, combat poverty, and prevent violence in our communities by helping people get back to work.  Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens benefits public safety. With little hope of obtaining a decent paying job, returning citizens are often left with few options but to return to a life of crime. A 2011 study in the Justice Quarterly concluded that the lack of employment was the single most negative determinant of recidivism. A report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that of the over 400,000 State prisoners released in 2005, 67.8 percent of them were rearrested within 3 years of their release, and 76.6 percent were rearrested within 5 years of their release.  Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens strengthens our economy. Poor job prospects for people with records reduced our Nation's gross domestic product in 2008 between $57 billion and $65 billion. With an increasingly competitive global economy and to maintain America's competitive advantage, we must promote employment of all  Today, I introduce the Fair Chance Act, which would help eliminate barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people and bring America closer to truly being a land of opportunity for all. It would preclude the federal government--including the executive, legislative, and judicial[[Page S2367]]branches--from requesting criminal history information from applicants until they reach the conditional offer stage.  This bill strikes the right balance. It would allow qualified people with criminal records to get their foot in the door and be judged on their own merit. At the same time, the legislation would allow employers to know an individual's criminal history before the job applicant is hired.  This bill would prohibit federal contractors from requesting criminal history information from candidates for positions within the scope of Federal contracts until a conditional job offer has been extended. Companies that do business with the Federal Government and receive Federal funds should espouse good hiring practices. The Fair Chance Act would permit Federal contractors to inquire about criminal history earlier in the hiring process if the job requires a candidate to access classified information.  The bill includes exceptions for sensitive positions where criminal history inquiries are necessary earlier in the application process. Exceptions include positions involving classified information, sensitive national security duties, armed forces, and law enforcement jobs, and jobs where criminal history information is legally required.  Finally, the Fair Chance Act would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in coordination with the U.Census Bureau, to report to Congress on the employment statistics of returning citizens. Currently, no comprehensive tracking of data on the employment histories of people with convictions exists. This provision would change that and allow us to better understand the scope of the problem people with convictions face when trying to find a job.  I am proud to reintroduce the Fair Chance I want to again thank the bill cosponsors and their leadership on this issue. I urge this legislation's speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2365.txt,2194,ANNOUNCEMENT BY COMMITTEE ON RULES REGARDING AMENDMENT PROCESS FOR H.R.,2017.0,4.0,March
3778,topic-id,1994,"Mr.President, I join with my colleagues today. I appreciate the Senator from Oregon and his remarks. I join with him and the others who have spoken to express my grave concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection  It is really unacceptable to me that someone who denies climate change science could be put in charge of an agency that is really tasked with advancing our national strategy to address climate change and the ills resulting. Mr.Pruitt has said--the overwhelming evidence to the contrary--that the debate is far from settled. He denies what is happening in regards to the evidence and the science and the conclusions of the near consensus of scientists.  Time and again, this attorney general from Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt, has filed suits actually to block the EPA's clean air and clean water regulations protocols, which have allowed the United States to lead the efforts to reduce carbon emissions and address the climate crisis we face.  There are few issues, in my opinion, that are as urgent as this, and across the globe that we must meaningfully do something collectively about. America must lead and not have a leader on this issue that is now so far out of step with global consensus. Everyone, from scientists and climate experts to business leaders and even our own military officials, understands that climate change is a real threat, not just to our environment but also to our economy, to the health of our people and our national security.  It is disturbing that, in a way--and it also defies common sense--if you hear the way some people talk about climate change, including our President-elect and Mr.Pruitt, you might think that not only is climate change not a problem but that it is not our problem. This could not be further from the truth. We are already, here in America, dealing with and seeing the very real impact of climate change.  Ask anyone living in my home State along the shore or a family in Louisiana whose home has been destroyed by severe flooding or a farmer whose land has become barren from the droughts in California whether or not these consequences are real for their families. Yet, the President-elect and Mr.Pruitt not only refuse to acknowledge the consequences that we are facing but the dangerous and destructive path ahead. They are failing to face that if we fail to act.  Now, the facts of climate change are worth repeating. Air temperatures are rising. Ocean temperatures are increasing. The ocean is becoming far more acidic. Sea levels are rising, both because of expansion of warming oceans and because of the melting of land-based snow and ice that is now entering our oceans. Many mountain glaciers are melting away and the Arctic sea ice is decreasing.  Climate change is an American issue and it is a global issue. Addressing climate change should be a cause where we find agreement across political and geographic divides. In many ways, it already is. We have seen 36 Noble prize winners come together in 2015 in a historic declaration on the threats of climate change. Brad Schmidt, winner of the 2011 Noble Prize in Physics stated: ``I see this issue as the single greatest threat to human prosperity.''  That is why, in late December 2015, 195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, a historic global agreement to meaningfully address climate change. That is why the Climate and Security Advisory Group, a nonpartisan group of 43 military and national security experts, including former military officials, spoke out to urge the next administration to ``comprehensively address the security risks of climate change at all levels of national security planning.''  That is why more than 300 American businesses--significant economic engines of our economy--sent a letter to the President-elect urging him to address climate change and to continue America's participation in the Paris Agreement, saying: ``Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing law-carbon investments into trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.''  You see, that is the false narrative--that somehow people's working on the climate change issue is done at the expense of businesses. But business leaders understand that there is a tremendous opportunity in the new economy--in a green-energy economy. There is tremendous agreement that America should be leading on this innovation and these ideas, not following that of others around the globe.  They are health care folks who understand the challenges to American health. That is why the American Lung Association warned that ``climate change threatens the health of millions of people. While everyone is at risk for the harms of climate change and air pollution, those most at risk include infants, children, older adults, and those with lung disease (such as asthma and COPD), cardiovascular disease or diabetes. They are the ones who must rush to the emergency room when they cannot breathe because of worsened ozone pollution during a heat wave, or when smoke blows into their yard from wildfires that may be burning hundreds of miles away.''  When we talk about climate change, we aren't talking about ideology or opinion. We are talking about science and evidence. We are talking about national security. We are talking about creating greater economic prosperity, and obviously we are talking about public health.  America cannot sit idly by. We cannot be sidelined in this effort, not just because we produce such a significant amount of the climate-changing chemicals and byproducts but also because we don't want to shirk the opportunities of being a leader in this space. And the American people really understand this. They understand that this isn't a lose-lose, that this could be a win-win for America and the globe. And that is why, according to a Gallop poll from March of last year--it said clearly that the majority of Americans are worried about global warming, and the majority of Americans believe global warming is a result of manmade pollution.  I understand that for many people climate change is not an immediate urgency and reality, but, again, we should understand that right now, many of our more vulnerable Americans are suffering as a result. I see this when I go home from here in Washington to Newark has almost an epidemic level of asthma, with kids missing school because of this health and lung risk. The facts are clear: The pollutants kids breathe are real. For families living in communities on the shore in my State who are still rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy, the facts are clear: Their homes are being destroyed by unpredictable weather events. In New Jersey, we have seen the damage up and down our coast, with rising sea levels, flooding, and extreme weather.  We know that those who can least afford it--low-income, hard-working families--are severely impacted around the country. Communities that are poor, often minority populations, disproportionately endure pain and suffering related to changes in the weather due to climate change.  We know that when evacuation orders are given, those who can afford to leave their homes face a far different reality than those who have financial constraints.  Not only is it more difficult for working families to deal with climate-related issues, but the neighborhoods and communities in which they live are often the ones that are more affected by the rising temperatures and the pollution caused by climate change. One researcher who conducted a 2014 study[[Page S339]]on the effects of climate change reported that ``generally, higher poverty neighborhoods are warmer, and wealthier neighborhoods are cooler.'' We see that in cities in New  Multiple studies continue to show that poorer communities are more likely to be exposed to harmful pollutants than higher income communities. One study from the University of Minnesota found that Americans of color are exposed on average to 38 percent higher levels of outdoor nitrogen dioxide and that disparities in exposure amount to about 7,000 deaths a year from the health problems caused by these realities.  Climate change is already posing real dangers. The most recent National Climate Assessment released in 2014 noted that communities in rural America, as well as urban communities, have already experienced consequences of climate change, including ``crop and livestock loss from severe drought and flooding, damage to levees and roads from extreme storms, shifts in planting and harvesting times, and large-scale losses from fires and other weather-related disasters.'' The report concludes that ``these impacts have profound effects, often significantly affecting the health and well-being of rural residents and communities.''  In States like Oklahoma, for example, where the State legislature mandated a study on the potential impacts of climate change, the group commissioned to do that study, the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, definitively concluded the following:       The Earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years.      The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable      future. Much of the global average temperature increases over      the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities,      particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.      Oklahoma will be impacted.  Undoubtedly, New Jersey, Oklahoma--where Mr.Pruitt is from--and the rest of our country and the world will continue to be impacted by this problem, especially if America does not lead and falls behind.  We have made great strides, though, in addressing climate change under President Obama, including critical tax credits for wind and solar energy that not only help deal with climate change but also help American businesses thrive and lead, with now more people being employed by solar than coal. We have the historic Paris agreement and EPA regulations to reduce emissions from the electric power and transportation sectors. We are making strides of which we all should be proud, and actually our economy is benefiting as a result.  The United States has now emerged as a global leader in meaningfully addressing climate change. We cannot afford to slow down this progress, but I am afraid that under the leadership of President-Elect Donald Trump, that is exactly where we are headed. Despite scientific evidence, popular concern, and the real-life impacts of climate change being evidenced in communities all across the country, all different backgrounds, from urban to rural, our President-elect and his nominee for the EPA, Attorney General Scott Pruitt, plan to advance special interests ahead of the common interest, of the global interest, of America's interests.  The United States has a long legacy of leading, being a global leader in times of crisis, and at a time when we see the realities of climate change, at a time when we and many scientists are concluding that there is a global crisis and military leaders are concluding that we have a global crisis, at a time when we are seeing the effect of that crisis being made real in regions across our Nation and our planet Earth, America must not waiver in its commitment.  I believe the Environmental Protection Agency deserves a leader who is prepared to lead--not deny, not retreat, not equivocate, not surrender ground that we have gained. We deserve to have an EPA leader who is just that--someone who stands up to lead, who makes the difficult choices and finds ways to unify our country, to pull from the wisdom of the military, the wisdom of businesses, the wisdom of communities like the one in which I live, and chart a course for this country that helps to lead the globe, lead planet Earth out of this crisis and into the strength we can find through American leadership. I believe that is the task: that we can save our environment and create incredible prosperity in the future.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

3761,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, skyrocketing drug prices are crippling far too many American families. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans believe the cost of their prescription drugs is too high and that Congress should work to lower the price of medication that people need.  This should be our top health priority for 2017, lowering drug costs for families, not taking health care away from Americans with no plan to replace it. Think about that. This Congress is hell-bent on, instead of attacking one of the major causes of health care inflation--and we have done a good job the last 10 years, by and large, of keeping prices from going much higher than they would have otherwise. Keep that in mind while we hear the generally specious arguments against the Affordable Care Instead of doing that, the majority party has fallen all over itself to try to take away health insurance from 900,000 people in my State; taking away from 1 million seniors the Medicare consumer protections and Medicare services of preventive care, such as osteoporosis screening, diabetes screening, physicals, all that the doctors order; taking away from 100,000 young people the ability to stay on their parents' health care plan; and stripping from virtually all Ohio citizens the consumer protections of denying people coverage because of previous conditions, cutting people off their insurance policy because they happen to get too sick and might have cost the insurance companies too much money.  This health care coverage that has saved 24,000 American lives each year since 2014, just think what could happen if we took away their health care coverage.  Instead, lowering drug prices should be something we can come together on.[[Page S221]]Americans of all political parties and Americans who don't even bother voting are all facing skyrocketing pharmacy bills. There are concrete actions we can take right now to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  Senator Franken and I led 18 of our colleagues in outlining 5 of them in a letter to the President-elect in December, including putting an end to abusive price gouging, requiring more transparency from drug companies, boosting competition and innovation in the market, and allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate better prices for seniors. That is what we do with the Veterans' The VA, on behalf of 7 million veterans, negotiates directly with the drug companies to get a significantly better price for the cost of drugs--saves taxpayers, saves veterans. Medicare should do the same thing.  Senator Klobuchar and I worked with several colleagues to reintroduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Negotiating better prices for seniors will save significant taxpayer dollars.  Instead of focusing on the priorities that the vast majority of Americans agree on, Congress and President-Elect Trump are working to throw 30 million Americans and some 900,000 Ohioans off their health insurance with no plans to replace it. It is reckless and dangerous. It will cause premiums to skyrocket. It will cause costs to go up for everyone. Do you know what it does? It gives a $30 billion tax break to drugs companies and tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest  On the one hand, Congress will not do anything about drug prices because the pharmaceutical industry, frankly, gave too much money to far too many of my colleagues. On the other hand, this same Congress is going to strip away health care and consumer protections to seniors on Medicare and people of all ages and at the same time give a tax break to the drug companies. We must fight against these attempts to decrease coverage and increase costs for working families.  Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not, we all agree you can't ask people to change horses midstream without giving them a second horse.  Last week, I spoke with one of my constituents, Kathy, who wrote to my office last November with the heartbreaking story of her husband He is fighting stage IV cancer. Before 2010, insurance companies denied Kathy and her family the family coverage she needed because her husband's cancer was a preexisting condition. Thankfully, the Affordable Care Act stopped insurance companies from abusive practices like this. It allowed Kathy's family to buy health insurance through the marketplace, helping them afford the care he needs to fight this devastating disease. Still, like so many Ohio families, Kathy continues to struggle to afford the prescription medicines she and her husband need. She fears what will happen when a family like hers is simply kicked off their insurance.  Imagine 900,000 Ohioans with insurance and, like that--because of partisan politics here, because so many of my colleagues ran for President, in some cases, or ran for the Senate or ran for the House by saying they are going to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and they are going to get rid of it and not replace it for a couple of years maybe.  Governor Kasich, Republican Governor in my State--also in the Presidential race with my friend in the Presiding Officer's chair--has said to the Senate and House, to Ohio's Republican Members: Don't cancel the Affordable Care Don't throw people off insurance unless you are going to replace it with something right now that will take care of those people; 700,000 people on Medicaid expansion, another 200,000 people, 26-year-olds, on their parents' plan, people on the exchanges, people getting insurance in other ways.  When I was talking to Kathy the other day, she was choked up talking about the stress and heartache dealing with a loved one with cancer, how she can't even bear the thought of adding more insurance worries on top of that. I was speaking to a hospital administrator today at one of Ohio's great hospitals. He said he thinks what this Republican Congress is going to do in the Affordable Care Act is morally reprehensible. He said: How do I explain to people right in the middle of their treatment that we can't do it anymore? Because we will not have the resources if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and the insurance is canceled and the Medicaid expansion is gone and hospitals can't take care of everybody like they are pretty much now. How do I explain to somebody right in the middle of cancer treatment, right in the middle of another kind of long-term or short-term illness that their insurance has been cut off?  Instead of kicking people off their insurance with no plan to replace it and handing billions of dollars in tax breaks to the drug companies, let us make our first priority lowering drug costs for the people whom we say we are serving.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS220-5.txt,2106,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,10.0,March
3534,topic-id,164,"Mr.Speaker, as a medical provider, I understand how critical and necessary patient choice and input is to theoverall quality of our healthcare system. Put simply, patients are better off when they are equipped to make their owndecisions.  Unfortunately, ObamaCare limits patient choice, as outlined in this chart. In fact, in the ObamaCare marketplace, patientsin two-thirds of our country are limited to a choice of one or two insurers. Across five entire States, patients have only oneoption. To me, the marketplace looks more like a government-created monopoly under a system where every American is required bylaw to purchase the product.  To make matters worse, the onerous mandates in the law have led to restricted physician networks. So not only do patientshave little choice regarding their insurers, they are also limited to what physicians they can see.  It turns out we can't keep our doctors even if we like them. That is why we are offering a Better Way plan that expandschoice and empowers patients.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH403.txt,2018,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,12.0,March

Water uses currently at this dam span the gamut from irrigation, domestic, industrial, municipal, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Power generation is a secondary purpose at the dam, and current uses also include industrial capacity for our trona miners, fertilizer producers, and fulfillment of a range of energy needs.  Mr.Speaker, this bill would simply authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into a cooperative agreement with the State of Wyoming so that we could begin the process to study, design, and construct increased capacity for the reservoir. This is a process, Mr.Speaker, that has been held up previously by onerous NEPA requirements, and we need to move quickly so that we can begin to increase this capacity.  Currently the reservoir has 265,000 acre-feet to accommodate water as active capacity. This legislation would potentially add an additional 80,000 acre-feet of existing reservoir space.

3598,topic-id,1731,"Mr.President, today is a day when many Senators are speaking about Judge Gorsuch and about the Supreme As I think many know, in the last week, in the Judiciary Committee hearings and in other settings, I have announced that I will vote against Judge Gorsuch on the final vote tomorrow. I believe I have made my reasons for my opposition clear. I have thoroughly reviewed and considered Judge Gorsuch's record and where he fits within American jurisprudence, and I have no second thoughts about my decision.  As I look around at what has just happened on this Senate floor, I am sick with regret. So I rise now to speak in defense of the  The Senate has been hailed by many, including our nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, as the world's greatest deliberative body. Yet today I think one more blow has been struck at that title and reality.  The late Senator Robert Byrd, who served in this Chamber for 51 years, would famously remind new Senators that ``in war and in peace, [the Senate] has been the sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of a political minority.''  Of course, although Senator Byrd was the longest serving Senator, as a Delawarean, I grew up in the tradition of Senator Joe Biden, a 36-year veteran of this body who left its ranks only to ascend to the Vice Presidency and spend 8 more years as its Presiding  Since I have had the honor of assuming Senator Biden's former seat, I have committed to following his example of working across the aisle, through Republican and Democratic administrations, with whoever is willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work for the American people. I know my colleagues share in this foundational commitment to serve our constituents and country.  As I look around at what just happened on this floor, with too little discussion of its lasting consequences and too little visible concern or even emotion, I must ask the question: Where are we headed?  You can't see it, but around this Chamber are white marble statues, busts of former Presiding Officers, of former Vice Presidents of the United They are in the halls outside this They are at the upper level of this Chamber, in the All the former Vice Presidents are memorialized in white marble busts.  Former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, the grandfather of the Illinois Governor who ran for President in the middle of the 20th century--former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, when he delivered his farewell address to the Senate on his last day in office as the Presiding Officer of the Senate in 1897, said:       It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body      are founded deep in human experience; that they are the      result of centuries of tireless effort . . . to conserve, to      render stable and secure, the rights and liberties which have      been achieved by conflict.       By its rules, the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own      power. Of those who clamor against the Senate and its mode of      procedure, it may be truly said, ``They know not what they      do.''       In this Chamber alone are preserved, without restraint, two      essentials of wise legislation and of good government--the      right of amendment and of debate.  It was exactly that right, those rules that were assaulted today, but they have been under assault for a long time.  In recent days, I have reached out to my Republican and Democratic colleagues, trying to see if there was some way we could reach a reliable consensus agreement to safeguard these institutional values and avoid the events of today and tomorrow.  I told my colleagues that I was not ready to end debate on Judge Gorsuch's nomination until we could chart a course for the Senate to move forward on a bipartisan basis when considering future Supreme Court nominations.  I think for us to get to any constructive conversation about moving this Senate forward requires owning the role that all of us--each of us has played over our time here, whether a few years or decades, in bringing us to this point.  I, for one, will say I have come over time to regret joining my Democratic colleagues in changing the rules for lower court nominations and confirmations in 2013. Of course, I could give an entire speech on the obstruction that led us to that point. I could document the Republican and Democratic deeds and misdeeds of the last Congress and the Congress before that and the decade before that.  As my more seasoned and senior colleagues demonstrated in the Judiciary Committee deliberations, those who have served here longest know best the record of grievance of Congresses in decades past.  I anticipate that many of my colleagues will come to regret the decisions and actions taken today in this Congress and in Congresses ahead. Instead of focusing on that shared regret, I want to work together not to continue to tear down the traditions and rules of the Senate but to find ways to strengthen and fortify and sustain them.  I worked to try to find a solution to get past this moment on the brink. I wanted to ensure our next Supreme Court nominee would be the product of bipartisan consultation and consensus, as was safeguarded for years by the potential of the 60-vote margin. I wanted certainty that the voice of the minority would still be heard when the next vacancies arise. Among many, this effort to forge consensus was met with hopelessness or even hostility.  Back home, thousands of constituents called my office, urging a vote against Gorsuch and urging I support the filibuster. Some even urged me to stop talking about any sort of deal. In fact, back home in Delaware, some national groups ran ads against me when there was even a rumor of a hint that there might be conversations about avoiding this outcome.  There were even Senators on both sides of the aisle who told me that an agreement was impossible. They said any agreement is based on trust, and we simply do not trust each other anymore.  Given the events of the last years, the disrespect and mistreatment of Merrick Garland, the course of the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, I can understand how there is a raw wound right now in this Chamber, where each side feels the other has mistreated a good and honorable and capable nominee for the Supreme  Let me say my last point again. Senators on both sides told me we could not find a durable compromise because we do not trust each other anymore. If we cannot trust each other anymore, then are there any big problems facing this country which we can address and solve?  This morning, I gave an address at the Brookings Institution about the[[Page S2394]]threat Russia poses to our democracy, to our allies, to our national security, and to the endurance of our If that threat is not something that deserves determined, bipartisan effort, I don't know what is.  There are many threats to our future I could lay out today, but let me simply emphasize that in the absence of trust, this body cannot play its intended constitutional role, and without trust, we will not rebuild what is necessary to sustain this body.  Everyone likes to point the finger at the other side as the source of this distrust. The reality is, there is abundant blame to go around.  Folks like to remember the good old days when Justice Scalia was confirmed by this body 98 to 0, when Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3, but if we look at our five most recent nominees to the Supreme Court who got votes, you can see a clear trend: Nine Senators, all Republican, voted against Justice Then 22 Senators voted against Justice Then 42 Senators, mostly Democrats, voted against Justice For President Obama's nominees, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, more than 30 Republican Senators opposed each one. Only nine Republican Senators voted for Sotomayor, and only five Republicans voted for Justice We have been on this trajectory--both parties--for some time.  Then, of course, we have Chief Judge Merrick Garland, the first Supreme Court nominee in American history to be denied a hearing and a vote, and we have Judge Gorsuch, the first to be the object of a partisan filibuster on this floor.  We did not get here overnight. We have become increasingly polarized. How can we work together to repair this lack of trust so we can face the very real challenges that face our Nation?  My own attempts of recent days--although I was blessed to be joined by Senators of good will and good faith and great skill in both parties--were ultimately not successful. I wish I had engaged sooner and more forcefully. I wish I had been clearer with my colleagues how determined I was to seek a result, but this doesn't mean I am disappointed that I tried, and it also doesn't mean I am going to stop. I am not going to stop trying to fix the damage that has been done, trying to find a better pathway forward.  I ask my colleagues: If you know what you have done today, then what will we do tomorrow? How could we avoid the further deepening, corrosive partisanship in this body? What past mistakes can each of us own up to? What steps can we take to mend these old wounds? What more can we do to move forward together?  We sometimes talk about the dysfunction of this body as if it is external to us, as if we bear no accountability for it, but at the end of the day, here we are: 100 men and women sent to represent 50 States of this Republic and 325 million people. In many ways, we have all let them down today.  I can tell you what I am going to do tomorrow. I commit to working with anyone who wants to join me to try to strengthen and save the rules and traditions of this body and its effectiveness as an absolutely essential part of the constitutional order for which so many have fought and died. It is what all of our predecessors would have wanted.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

3596,topic-id,929,"Madam President, the Senate has just restored itself to an almost unbroken tradition of never filibustering judges.  We have actually restored the status quo before the administration of President George It was during that administration when some of our friends across the aisle, along with some of their liberal law professor allies, dreamed up a way of blocking President George Bush's judicial nominees, and that was by suggesting that 60 votes was really the threshold for confirming judges, rather than the constitutional requirement of a majority vote.  It has been a long journey back to the normal functioning of the United States Senate, and it is amazing that it[[Page S2391]]has taken a nominee like Judge Gorsuch to bring us back to where we were back around 2001.  We have been debating and discussing this nominee for a long time now, and the opponents of Judge Gorsuch have tried time and time again to raise objections to this outstanding nominee--a nomination that no one in the Senate opposed 10 years ago when he was confirmed to a position on the Tenth Circuit Court of They claimed he wasn't mainstream enough. They said this was a seat that really should have gone to Merrick They have even accused him of plagiarism. All of these arguments have no merit whatsoever and really represent desperate attempts to try to block this outstanding nominee. Their claims were simply baseless, and that much became even clearer as folks from across the political spectrum and newspapers from across the country urged our Democratic colleagues to drop their pointless filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote.  What also came to light is the type of man Judge Gorsuch is--a man of integrity, a man of strong independence; in other words, exactly the kind of person you would want to serve on the Supreme  They even claimed that Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to side with the big guy against the little guy, ignoring the fact that during his 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where these judges sit on multi-judge panels, he was part of the majority decision 99 percent of the time, and 97 percent of those cases were unanimous in multi-judge panel decisions on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals--hardly radical. It actually is a remarkable record of a consensus-builder, someone who uses his great intellect, his education, and his training to build consensus on a multi-judge court--exactly the kinds of skills that are going to be so important for him to use on the Supreme Court of the United  As I said, ultimately today was the culmination of years of obstruction by our Democratic colleagues when it came to judicial nominees.  When I came to the Senate in 2003, the Democratic strategy was well underway to obstruct lower court judicial nominees from the George Bush administration.  Later, in 2013, when there was a Democrat in the White House and it suited them to do so, they decided to do away with the same tool they used and went nuclear, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 majority vote for circuit court nominees and district court nominees.  It took a Gang of 14--7 Democrats and 7 Republicans--to try to work through the differences back around the 2006 timeframe, which resulted in half of President George Bush's nominees to the circuit court getting confirmed and half not being confirmed. The standard was adopted by the so-called Gang of 14 that only under extraordinary circumstances would the filibuster be used, but that agreement expired in 2013.  Well, the minority leader and his colleagues like to say that back then it was necessary to restore a majority vote. He did that just last He said: ``Our Republican colleagues had been holding back on just about all of so many lower-court judges, including the very important DC circuit'' court, that they were forced to engage in the nuclear option back in 2013. But the facts really belie what the Democratic leader claimed in terms of the necessity of going nuclear back then. In fact, prior to 2013, the Senate had confirmed more than 200 of President Obama's judicial nominees and it rejected just 2--more than 200 confirmed, 2 rejected. That hardly rises to a level of extreme obstruction or partisanship. That is a 99-percent confirmation rate for President  So let's make it clear just how this began. It started with Democratic obstruction under a Republican administration in 2001, and it is been continuing now under a new Republican administration in 2017. So we really have come full circle to restore the status quo before 2001, when our Democratic friends started down this path.  President Trump has, by all accounts, selected a judge with impeccable qualifications and the highest integrity. Not one of our Democratic colleagues has been able to offer a convincing argument against him, and that is why several of our Democratic colleagues have crossed the aisle to support his nomination, and I thank them for that. I think more would join if they didn't fear retribution from the radical elements in their own political party.  So today Republicans in the Chamber are following through on what we said we would do. We said we would let the American people decide who would select the next Supreme Court nominee and then we would vote to confirm that nominee.

Once Carson is confirmed, we can begin working on several important issues under HUD's jurisdiction. Homelessness, especially among our Nation's veterans, needs to be addressed. We need to streamline regulatory burdens on local public housing agencies so that they can more efficiently serve the communities that rely on them. Financing arrangements for small and rural affordable housing developments should also be strengthened.  For years, there has been bipartisan interest in a number of these reforms. I look forward to having a strong partner at HUD so that we can tackle these important issues and many others head-on.

It is a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest In fact, tomorrow, when I cast that vote for Judge Gorsuch, it will be the first chance I have had as a Senator to confirm a Supreme Court nominee.  As it stands today, the U.Senate is on the precipice of confirming Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.Supreme Court Associate Just a few short hours ago, my colleagues on the other side caved to the pressures of the far left and unleashed an unprecedented, partisan filibuster for the first time in 238 years of this institution.  I was honored to be at the White House's East Wing on January 31, with President Trump, when he made the announcement that Judge Neil Gorsuch would be the nominee to replace Antonin  Judge Gorsuch's academic accomplishments are nothing short of being absolutely stellar. His decision to serve as a Justice on the highest Court in the land is a true testament to his character, his intelligence, his understanding of the law, and his commitment to the  Judge Gorsuch was appointed by President George Bush to the Tenth Circuit in 2006 and was unanimously confirmed by the U.In fact, some of those Democrats who did not oppose Judge Gorsuch then included his Harvard Law classmate Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Minority Leader Chuck  Of utmost importance in a Justice is the desire and the ability to apply the law as it is intended, not to legislate from the bench. So I can say that I was very thrilled to here Judge Gorsuch say this: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.''  On February 9, I met Judge Gorsuch in my office. Let me tell my colleagues, he is impressive. We discussed the We discussed the Second I represent the State of I can tell my colleagues that as we look at our Constitution and our Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment is very important to the people of He will defend the Second We also talked about the separation of powers, the role of government and federalism, and the Fourth  Through 4 full days of hearings, Judge Gorsuch eloquently answered Judiciary Committee members' questions, and certainly, before the entire viewing audience of the American people, he showcased his brilliant legal mind.  Prior to his hearing, he met with 80 He provided the Judiciary Committee with 70 pages of written answers regarding his personal record and over 75,000 pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written works going as far back as his college days. The White House archives produced over 180 pages of email and paper records related to Judge Gorsuch's time at the Department of  During the committee hearing, Judge Gorsuch sat for three rounds of questioning totaling nearly 20 hours. In fact, when Judge Gorsuch appeared before the Judiciary Committee of the U.Senate, it was the longest hearing of any nominee in this century. He answered nearly 1,200 questions during that hearing. By the way, that is nearly twice as many questions as Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or  Today's vote was nothing more than a campaign fundraising effort for Senate In fact, the Democratic Members who have pledged to support him already have threats from liberals of voting them out of office. It is a sad day that this body has become so partisan that, for the first time in this body's history, we had a partisan filibuster to a more than qualified nominee.  Judge John Kane, a judge appointed by Democrat Jimmy Carter, said in an op-ed for an online legal website:       As the saying goes, we could do worse. I'm not sure we      could expect better, or that better presently exists.  There is just no arguing that Judge Gorsuch a mainstream nominee.  Take the remarks of Obama's Solicitor General, Neal Katyal:       Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant      judges to have served our nation over the last century. As a      judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve      the rule of law.

Cybersecurity is a major national security issue and the threat is real and immediate. Day in and day out nation-states or criminal actors target the United States' critical infrastructure, the private sector, and everyday Americans, and they are succeeding. However, even with the heightened awareness on cybersecurity, it appears that the United States is not adequately prepared to prevent and respond to cyber attacks.  Since 2012, FEMA has released an annual National Preparedness Report, which highlights States' progress in meeting 32 core capabilities, as defined by the National Preparedness Every year, States have ranked their cybersecurity capabilities as one of their lowest.  I found these facts very alarming and wanted to learn more about the current state of cyber preparedness. That is why, last Congress, my subcommittee, the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee, held a joint hearing with the committee's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee to look at cyber preparedness and how the Federal Government can help States address some of the challenges they face.  We heard from a Homeland Security adviser, a fusion center representative, the Center for Internet Security, a chief information officer, and a chief technology officer, who explained the great progress the United States has made in enhancing their security capabilities. However, they cautioned that challenges still remain, especially with regard to information sharing of cyber threats and risks, and whether Homeland Security grants may be used for cybersecurity enhancements.  Last Congress, I introduced this bill to address the findings from that hearing. I introduced this bill in this Congress to ensure that States and first responders have the resources needed to prepare for and protect against cyber attacks.  This commonsense legislation will: Enhance cyber risk information sharing with State and major urban area fusion centers; authorize representatives from State and urban area fusion centers to be assigned to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center; and permit the NCCIC personnel to be deployed to the fusion centers.  It will allow information sharing on cyber preparedness best practices with State and local stakeholders. It will clarify the eligibility of State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative funding for cybersecurity enhancements; and it will work to combat the overclassification of cyber risk information so that it can be shared more broadly with stakeholders who have a need to know.

(3) The attrition rate at United States medical schools      averaged 3.4 percent in 2014, while rates at for-profit      Caribbean medical schools have been known to reach 30      percent.       (4) In 2016, residency match rates for foreign trained      graduates averaged 54 percent compared to 94 percent for      graduates of medical schools in the United       (5) On average, students at for-profit medical schools      operating outside of the United[[Page S2368]]     States and Canada amass more student debt than those at      medical schools in the United     4.

3580,topic-id,1220,"Mr.President, for 3 straight days, the Senate Republican leader has come to the floor and has given us a history of Presidential nominations to the Supreme Court, but clearly an investigation is necessary. There must have been a hacking into his computer because he can't print the name ``Merrick Garland'' to include in his speech. The Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, has failed to mention that name because that name is the reason we are in this spot today.  When Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, President Obama exercised his constitutional responsibility to send a nominee to the Senate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme For the first time in the history of the Senate--for the first time ever--this Republican-led Senate refused to give this nominee a hearing and a vote. It had never--underline the word ``never''--happened before.  Was the reason that he was unqualified? Of course not: he was unanimously ``well qualified,'' serving on the DC Circuit The reason was stated clearly by Senator McConnell: We are going to place a bet that the next President will be a Republican, and we will let them fill this vacancy.  When the Republicans come to the floor, as they have this morning talking about the politicization of this process, the reason we are here, when we should be celebrating the 1-year anniversary of Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court, is because they kept that position vacant so it could be filled by a Republican That is exactly why we are here today.  This notion that it is somehow fanciful that the choice of Neil Gorsuch was made by outside groups is belied by the very words of the President himself, who thanked the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation--two special interest, Republican organizations--for giving him a list of nominees for the Supreme It was very open and public, and there was gratitude--political gratitude--that they came up with the name Neil That is a fact.  When we look at the history that has led us to this moment, the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, has to accept what is clear. In the history of the United States of America, until Senator McConnell's days under President Obama, exactly 68 nominees had been filibustered. Under Senator McConnell and the Republicans, 79 nominees of President Obama's were filibustered. It was an abuse of the filibuster never seen before in the history of our Nation, and it was that abuse of the filibuster and statements made that they would leave vacancies on critical courts, like the DC Court of Appeals, there forever and ever amen, that led to the decision 4 years ago to say that we would employ a change in the rules so we could finally fill these court positions--finally break the filibuster death grip--which Senator McConnell brought to this Chamber in a way never before seen in history.  So the Senator from Kentucky has made history. He comes to the floor every day and tells us history. He made history in the number of filibusters he[[Page S2387]]used on this floor. He made history in denying a Presidential nominee the opportunity for a hearing and a vote, which had never--never--happened before in the history of the United Talk about partisanship.  When it comes to Judge Gorsuch, I read his cases. I sat through the hearings. I was in the Senate Judiciary We took a measure of the man. He was careful to avoid any question that he could when it came to his position on cases and issues and values, and that is not unusual. Supreme Court nominees do that.  So we tried to look at his cases. What do the cases that he decided reveal about the man? Two or three cases came right to the front. The first involved the sad story of a frozen truckdriver on Interstate 88 outside of Chicago in January a few years back. It was 14 degrees below zero, and the brakes on his trailer froze. He pulled to the side of the road, called his dispatcher who said: Stay with the truck. We are sending somebody. Hours passed. He was going through hypothermia. He was freezing. He called the dispatcher and said: I have to do something. He said: You either drive this disabled truck out on the interstate and take your best chances or you stick with the truck. He decided to unhitch the trailer and drive to a gas station, gas up and warm up, and come back. For that he was fired.  Seven judges looked at that case to decide whether it was fair to fire Alphonse Six of the judges said: No, he did the right thing. One judge said: I rule for the trucking company that fired him--Neil Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme  In the Hobby Lobby case, the decision was basic, who should decide the healthcare of thousands of workers. Well, the Green family who owns Hobby Lobby said: Our religious beliefs should dominate. We should decide family planning and birth control for our employees and their health insurance. Judge Gorsuch said: That is right because they own a corporation, and a corporation is a person, and as a corporation, they can have sincere religious beliefs. It was a choice between a corporate ownership of a family and 13,000 employees and their own personal religious rights, and Judge Gorsuch ruled for the corporation.  Kansas State A Kansas State University professor, Grace Hwang, after working there for many years, was diagnosed with cancer and had to go through a bone marrow transplant. She took 6 months off. Then, when she was called back to work, she called the university and said: I understand there is an influenza outbreak on campus, and I am afraid, after having just had a bone marrow transplant, to be exposed to influenza at this point. They said: You either come back and teach or you are fired. She didn't come back. They fired her. It was Judge Gorsuch who said their employer was right; Kansas State University was right.  Those are insights into the values of a man who wants a lifetime appointment to the U.Supreme Court, the highest Court in the land. The questions we have raised about his judgment and his values go to the heart of who we are and what we want to be. Do we want the Supreme Court to continue to be a voice for the corporations, the corporate elite, and employers? Do we want to exclude the opportunities of common people like that truckdriver, Al Maddin, to have his day in court and be treated fairly? That is what it comes down to. It is a fundamental question of fairness and justice.  I am sorry, because I love the Senate and I have spent a good part of my life here, that we have reached this moment. But it is this effort to fill the courts of this Nation with Republican appointments, even at the expense of violating Senate traditions that are over 100 years old, that has brought us to this moment.  As someone said, the nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell when he stopped Merrick What we are facing today is the fallout.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

3733,topic-id,879,"Mr.President, I rise in support of my resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act of the FCC's broadband privacy restrictions. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Privacy Subcommittee, I have spent more than a year closely examining this issue.  In February of 2015 the FCC, under then-Chairman Tom Wheeler, took the unprecedented step of reclassifying broadband providers as ``common carriers'' under title II of the Communications In other words, on a 3-to-2 party-line vote, the FCC decided that internet service providers should be treated like telephone companies for regulatory purposes. The decision encroached on the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction to regulate ISP privacy policies, stripping these companies of their traditional privacy regulator.  Recognizing that his actions to impose net neutrality on ISPs created regulatory uncertainty, last spring Chairman Wheeler began to float the idea of implementing new FCC privacy rules. The FCC decided, again on a 3-to-2 party-line vote, to move forward with the rule change just before election day. The whole process was unsettling, to say the least.  The FCC ultimately decided to commandeer an area of regulatory authority for itself, without any meaningful check on this unilateral action. Once it initiated the bureaucratic power grab, it proceeded to establish new rules restricting the free speech of its regulatory target.  I submitted comments to the agency expressing my constitutional concerns about its proposed rule. I wasn't alone in doing so. Noted Harvard law professor Larry Tribe, hardly one to be confused for a conservative, did the same. But the rules were finalized nonetheless.  While the FCC recently took a step in the right direction by staying the application of the privacy rules, these midnight regulations are still hanging out there. Congress needs to repeal these privacy restrictions in order to restore balance to the internet ecosystem and provide certainty to consumers.  These regulations have altered the basic nature of privacy protection in the United For decades, the FTC policed privacy based on consumer expectations for their data, not bureaucratic preferences. These consumer expectations were just common sense: Sensitive data deserves more protection than nonsensitive data.  Unfortunately, the FCC rules dispensed with this commonsense regulatory approach. Under the new rules, what matters isn't what the data is but, rather, who uses it. This creates a dual-track regulatory environment where some consumer data is regulated one way if a company is using it under the FCC's jurisdiction and an entirely different way if its use falls under the FTC, or the Federal Trade  This is all confusing enough, but it gets worse. In the consumer technology sector, innovation is the name of the game. Companies are constantly rolling out new products and competing to win over consumers. By the same token, consumers are always on the lookout for the newest gadget or app. But the FCC's privacy order makes it increasingly difficult for consumers to learn about the latest product offerings from broadband providers. Instead of being notified about faster and more affordable alternatives for their family's home internet needs, under the FCC's privacy order, Arizonans might get left in the dark.  The FCC's heavyhanded data requirements restrict the ability of broadband providers to offer services tailored to their customers' needs and interests, and they lead to inconsistent treatment of otherwise identical data online. When a regulation diminishes innovation, harms consumer choice, and is just all-around confusing, it is a bad regulation. The FCC's privacy rule for ISPs is a bad regulation.  When it chose to impose needlessly onerous privacy regulations on broadband providers while leaving the rest of the internet under the successful FTC regime, the FCC unfairly picked one politically favored industry--the edge providers--to prevail over a different industry--broadband.  Repealing the FCC's privacy action is a crucial step toward restoring a single, uniform set of privacy rules for the internet. The FTC's privacy rules are the result of an ongoing, data-driven effort to understand and protect consumer expectations. That is the The FCC's rules, on the other hand, are the hasty byproduct of political interest groups and reflect the narrow preferences of well-connected insiders.  To sum all of this up, the FCC's midnight privacy rules are confusing and counterproductive. This CRA will get rid of it, pure and simple. But let me say what it won't do. Despite claims to the contrary, using this CRA will not leave consumers unprotected. That is because the FCC is already obligated to police the privacy practices of broadband providers under section 222 of the Communications Act, as well as various other Federal and State laws.  Both Chairman Wheeler and Chairman Pai agree on that point. Just last week, Chairman Pai wrote to my friends on the other side of the aisle confirming this legal fact.  This resolution will not disrupt the FCC's power, nor will it infringe on the FTC's jurisdiction elsewhere. Neither will it affect how broadband providers currently handle consumer data. Broadband providers are currently regulated under section 222, and they will continue to be after these midnight regulations are rescinded.  Passing this CRA will send a powerful message that Federal agencies can't unilaterally restrict constitutional rights and expect to get away with it. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.  I yield back the remainder of my time.

3414,topic-id,402,"Mr.Speaker, last month I had the privilege of meeting Lisa and Chad Smith and their charming son Jamil during a visit to Newland, North Carolina, in the Fifth  The Smiths are the proprietors of Forage Soaps, which began in 2014 with a $50 purchase of supplies and a trip to the Avery County Farmers Market to sell their first batch of wild-crafted soaps made in their kitchen. Wild-crafted refers to plants collected from their natural or indigenous habitat. The Smiths handpicked these botanicals fresh from the trail with minimal environmental impact to ensure long-term sustainability.  Well, that first batch turned into a second batch and a third batch, and so on. As they continued to make soap, they bought better equipment and invested in larger orders of supplies. Word spread about their soap, and before they knew it, the Smiths were receiving invitations to attend craft and artisan shows. They were invited to put their soap in several local galleries, and it wasn't long before they were filling their first wholesale order.  Today their business includes a retail location that also functions as their studio as well as several small satellite locations and an online store. Chad works for Mountain Electric Cooperative full time, and Lisa has a master's degree in organic chemistry and biology. She has been making soap for more than 20 years.  The Smiths adopted Jamil when he was 18 months old. They were told he would never be able to speak and may never be able to walk. Today he does both and is attending school and thriving with their loving care. He even helps out with the business, where he loves to mix oils and wild-craft herbs. Their older children help with deliveries and during special events, while their grandchildren like to come on weekends to help stock shelves and run the cash register. It is truly a family affair.  Lisa likes to say she and Chad built their business one bar of soap at a time. They didn't take out business loans or expect to be an overnight success.

We are proud that we have a Coloradan nominated to the Nation's highest Court and that he would be the second Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, the other one being Justice Byron Justice Byron White also led the NFL in rushing one year, and while Gorsuch will never live up to that part of the Supreme Court legacy for Coloradans, we know that Judge Gorsuch is an avid outdoorsman, a fly-fisher, expert-level skier, and somebody who understands public lands. I think having that kind of expertise and experience on our Nation's highest Court will serve this country well.  I think it is important to understand that his roots represent the roots that built the He is a fourth-generation Coloradan, somebody who hails from a State that is independent, that takes great pride in its libertarian streak, its love of the outdoors, recreational opportunities, understanding agriculture, energy. It is a State that really does have it all. From the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope, there is great beauty in our  Neil Gorsuch understands that. He served on a court, the Tenth Circuit Court, that is housed in Denver and represents 20 percent of the landmass of our Judge Gorsuch's family, as I mentioned, really does show the grit and determination of those who built the His grandfather was someone who worked in Union Station, someone who grew up driving trolleys back in the time when Denver was a trolley town. His other grandfather, of course, was a physician, and both were experts in their fields. One grandfather helped found a law firm, Gorsuch Kirgis, a very prestigious firm in  But it is Judge Gorsuch's experience, his high qualifications of academics that he brings to the Court, having received his degrees from Columbia, Oxford, Harvard, as I mentioned previously--the most important academic experience being the University of Colorado, where I think he spent at least some time in the summer attending, and also teaching a course as a professor at my alma mater, the University of Colorado School of This has all helped him build what he is today; that is, a very mainstream jurist, an incredibly exceptional legal mind, one of the brightest jurists this country has to offer, someone who is known as a feeder judge, providing clerks to the Supreme Court, and who has the respect of the Colorado legal community.  I want to talk about some of these things because I have come to the floor multiple times, and I have talked about his qualifications. I have talked about the people who know him best,[[Page S2392]]not the people in Washington, DC, but the people who have practiced in front of his court in Denver, the people who know him personally out in  Here is what those individuals have said. They believe that Judge Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote. Bill Ritter, former Democratic Governor for the State of Colorado, believes that Judge Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote. Now we will have it. We have invoked cloture. We will have a final debate on Friday night and a final vote on whether or not he should be confirmed.  People like Steve Farber, the cochair of the Democratic National Convention in 2008 in Colorado, have talked about the need to confirm Judge  So the debate that we enter now is not one of whether he will have an up-or-down vote. He is going to have an up-or-down vote. But it is whether we should confirm him, actually give him the ``yes'' vote.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Some of the arguments that I have heard over the past several weeks on the floor, listening to some of the arguments on the floor--it is quite interesting to me that some of the arguments we hear seem to be at odds with each other.  Presiding over the Senate yesterday, I heard people talk about how they don't think Neil Gorsuch will stand up to the They are concerned that he will not express the kind of independence the judiciary commands, that he will not be someone to stand up to the President of the United They often cite some of the comments or tweets that the President has made and then fail to mention the fact, though, that at the very time one of those tweets was mentioned, questioning the judiciary, Judge Gorsuch, in a meeting with one of our Democratic colleagues, actually had objections. He said he objected to the statements the President had made, expressing his independence, talking about how what he had heard was demoralizing--very much showing independence.  But the second argument you often hear, for those who have decided to oppose this mainstream jurist, is that they are afraid he won't show enough independence from the President, and then they say they are concerned about his language as it relates to the Chevron doctrine--whether Judge Gorsuch is going to be willing to overturn the Chevron doctrine.  I find those two arguments kind of interesting because, on one hand, you have an argument saying we are afraid he is not going to stand up to the President of the United States, and then, on the other hand, you have an argument saying that we are afraid he is not going to stand up to the administrative state of the President of the United States--because that is what the Chevron doctrine does; it gives great deference to the regulatory body, to the administrative state.  Here is another irony. The Administrator of the EPA in 1984 was Neil Gorsuch's mother, Anne Burford--the Administrator of the She was the first woman to serve as EPA Administrator who was the subject of the Chevron doctrine.  Not only is he willing to stand up to the President and the administrative state of the President, but he is willing to overturn a case that was a subject that his own mother was a subject to.  I have also heard comments from colleagues on the aisle that Judge Gorsuch is not a mainstream jurist. This argument, I think, can be dealt with in a couple of ways because there are some pretty good statistics to refute these arguments.  Ninety-seven. Ninety-seven percent is the number of times in the 2,700 opinions that he was a part of--97 percent represents the times that the decisions were unanimous. Judge Gorsuch did not serve only with conservative-appointed judges. He didn't serve with only Republican nominees. Judge Gorsuch served with Republican and Democrat nominees, appointments approved by the In 97 percent of the cases, Judge Gorsuch ruled--decided--in unanimous decisions.  The other statistic that I think is even more revealing, of course, as to whether Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge is 99 percent. Ninety-nine percent is the amount of times that Judge Gorsuch ruled with the majority of the court; he made decisions--opinions--with the majority of the court.  I heard a comment yesterday from a colleague who said that Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee. If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee, do you think we would see a judge before us that has support from the 2008 Democratic National Convention Chairman? If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be mainstream nominee, do you think we would have decisions by the Democratic Governor of Colorado, former Democratic Governor of Colorado, to demand or ask for an up-or-down vote? If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee, do you think that the President would have nominated somebody who agreed 99 percent of the time with his colleagues on the bench, colleagues who came from appointments given by Republican Presidents and Democrat Presidents?  The arguments over whether Judge Gorsuch is going to be with the little guy or he spends too much time defending the big guy--well, let me again go back to the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best, who have practiced in front of his court. Here is a statement from a Denver attorney and Democrat on representing underdogs before Judge This is from the Denver Post: ``He issued a decision that most certainly focused on the little guy.''  Yet the story from the opposition here, out of 2,700 cases, is: Oh, my gosh, this is a person who has never defended the little guy. Well, here is somebody who has practiced in front of his court who absolutely believes he focused on the little guy.  So we have a judge who agrees with the majority of the court most of the time--99 percent of the time; 97 percent of the time it is a unanimous decision, and lawyers practicing in front of him believe that he represents the little guy. We have heard from leading Democrat voices in Colorado who support him. The ABA gave him its highest qualification, rankings, ratings. They believe it.  Then the question becomes, What are we looking for in a Justice? Maybe that is the biggest argument here. Maybe the argument should be about what are we looking for in terms of philosophy, ideology?  Well, we have seen his ideology and his philosophy in what he has testified before the Judiciary Committee, what he has stated in the past through writings. He is someone who is going to follow the law. He is someone who is going to take a decision where the law leads him, not somebody who is going to take an opinion or decision where his personal beliefs or politics take him. That is the kind of judge we want on the highest That is the kind of Justice we want--someone who is not going to decide a policy preference from the bench of the Supreme Court, not somebody who is going to take a look at a public opinion poll or someone who is going to take a look at a focus group and make a decision but someone who will rule by the law.  I have heard colleagues come to the floor and talk about their experiences where they were given decisions to read without being given the law. They were given just the facts of the case. They said: How would you have decided this case? Then they showed him the actual ruling, the actual holding in the case.  Some people believe, well, that is not the way we would have decided because we don't feel that was a good outcome; we don't feel that was the right policy.  It is not the job of a Justice to put their thumb on the scale of policy; it is the job of a Justice to be a guardian of the Constitution, to defend the Constitution, to follow the law and to decide cases based on the law not on feelings, politics, polls, public opinion.  We have a judge, nominated for Justice, who has said that a judge who agrees with every opinion that they have issued is probably a bad judge. He is paraphrasing other judges and Justices throughout our history. It is because he knows it is not his job to issue opinions or decisions or to decide a case based on being a Republican or It is not his job to decide a case based on whether he was nominated by President Trump or President Obama or President It is his job to look at the law, to leave policy decisions to the legislative branch. That is what we have to do. That is what Judge Gorsuch has said he will do.[[Page S2393]]  So these arguments just don't hold water. It doesn't hold water that he is not looking out for the interests of our citizens, because here clearly he is. Democrats who have practiced before him in court have said as much. The argument that he will not stand up to Trump administration--we know it; he said in front of our Democratic colleagues that he would stand up to the  He has said that he rejected attacks on the We also know that when it comes to the Chevron doctrine, which seems to be sacred ground now, that there are these ironic arguments taking place, because you want someone who will stand up to the administration, but then you are concerned that he is interested in or concerned that we have taken the Chevron deference--the doctrine of Chevron deference too far.  Now which is it? Do you want a judge who is going to stand up to the administration or do you want a judge who is not going to stand up to the administration? It sounds as though the arguments are trying to have it both ways.  The bottom line is that we know Judge Gorsuch to be a person who is eminently qualified, a mainstream jurist who has the respect and admiration of judges around the country, who has the admiration and respect of fellow jurists and legal professionals throughout Colorado, and we know that he will make this country proud. He is certainly going to make Colorado proud as he receives his confirmation to the Nation's highest  I hope, as we spend these hours debating, that we can realize this Senate should operate in a bipartisan fashion, that we should confirm judges who are clearly mainstream.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2383-5.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,4.0,April
3510,topic-id,4043,"Mr.Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to follow my good friend from Iowa, Steve I know Mr.King cares deeply about He not only cares deeply, but having been in the private sector in business where he, like our President, was involved in building things and making things work and making things accessible, he has good solutions. I have no doubt if he were not in Congress, he probably would have gotten the bid on the sections of the wall that the President is taking bids on even now.  We are at an interesting time. It has been interesting to see some of the messages. Some are hurtful. I know the liberal papers like the Longview newspaper immediately pick up on any dissension in the Republican Party, especially if it is aimed at conservatives like me. I don't know why we use the term ``conservative.'' It used to be just somebody with common sense that believed in keeping our word, believed in following the  We seem to get in trouble when we don't follow the For example, it makes very clear that everyone who is an American citizen is supposed to have rights. We can't assure the rights of every person in every other country. That would turn into this remarkable experiment in a republican form of government that we have here.  It is really a democratic Republic--a Republic where you select representatives so that you don't have big gangs running around as a majority wreaking havoc when people disagree with them. We elect representatives so they can come together and, hopefully, read bills and not have to vote on them so they can find out what is in them, go ahead and read the bills in advance and hopefully have something to do with the writing of the bills, especially things that affect people's health.  When we see messages like have come out today, it is unpleasant. One was apparently sent out from the White House, condemning the Freedom Caucus, apparently, because we have the audacity to want Republicans, including those at the White House, to keep our promise. I still remain in favor of--as do my friends on the Freedom Caucus and a lot of others--and remain committed to our promise to repeal  I realize there can be honest disagreement. Some think if we give more power to Health and Human Services, more Federal Government, and give more power to the people we trust in the Federal Government, whom I do trust, then they can do what Congress is not willing to do, and that is repeal ObamaCare and have a system in place that will assure people can get health care that is affordable.  The fact is most people talk about how we have got to make sure people can get health insurance. And then, over the years, they use the term ``health care'' synonymously with ``health insurance.'' Actually, the fact is we should be most concerned about people, all Americans, having access to affordable health care, whether they have insurance or not.  One of the problems that health insurance has gotten into over the last 50 years is that health insurance has ceased to be insurance. Under ObamaCare, health insurance was certainly not insurance.  If you look up the root of insurance, the word ``insure,'' insurance was intended to be something you could purchase very cheaply that would insure against an unforeseeable event some point in the future, maybe a catastrophic accident, a chronic disease, something that you don't expect and you hope never happens. For the insurance companies, it is actually a form of legalized wager that you are paying a little amount, hoping that never happens, but just in case it does, insurance will be able to take care of it at that point.  We have long since lost the idea of true insurance, and people began paying health insurance companies not to insure against an unforeseeable event in the future, but to pay them to manage their health care, to tell their doctors what medication they could prescribe, what procedures they would cover to help their patients, telling the patients which doctors they could see.  Actually, the truth is, as the Federal Government got more and more involved, we saw less and less insurance and more and more insurance companies managing people's health care, and the managing insurance companies were actually following the lead of the Federal  The more we passed laws regarding health care and insurance, the more the Federal Government had a say in people's health care and well-being and the more insurance companies moved into a management role, much as the Federal Government in Medicare and Medicaid moved into a governing role.  This morning, I am meeting with constituents that are very caring individuals and who provide health centers that are extremely affordable, very, very cheap, but provide quality care for people that can't afford the care. They don't have to go to the emergency room, which costs more than going to a clinic for minor matters. It saves a lot of money. It is a lot of cheaper.  Of course, emergency room care is about the most expensive care you can get, and people who don't have insurance often go and line up at emergency rooms, which drives up the cost of everybody's health care and everybody's health insurance. We can break the cycle of that.  I understand there are very well-meaning friends on the Republican side of the aisle that think if we just give the Federal Government, give Health and Human Services, more power to control all of this, we have a guy in place that I do believe can do great things to cure the ills of health care.  My problem is, if we don't repeal the outrage known as ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act--which is really unaffordable--if we don't actually repeal it here in the House, have the Senate repeal it, then no matter how much those in the executive branch and those in Health and Human Services, including my friend, the Secretary, no matter how much they do to help Americans, the next liberal that comes in, the next Kathleen Sebelius who comes in thinking she knows more about what is best for you than you do, then all of those great reforms will go out the window. Because the Secretary will have more authority and more ability to make regulation under the Republican proposed bill, then I am quite certain that somebody that comes in, like Kathleen Sebelius, who knows better what you need than you do, will make sure that the regulations and the overreach become even more burdensome.  I totally understand the President's frustration. He was told that the Republican bill would basically repeal The truth is I totally agree with the We need to act to repeal I stand with the President, through whatever hardship, to repeal  I have heard people referring already to the Republican bill as There are some good things in the bill,[[Page H2586]]but it appears to analysts that I trust and have a reputation for being accurate that premiums will go up and that this bill is not going to really bring down health insurance costs and that they may go up for the next 2 years.  Hopefully, in 2019, after Republicans have lost the majority because we didn't keep our promise, they are projecting that in 2019 the prices will go down maybe 10 percent if everything works out well. That would be good for the new Democratic majority because they will have taken office and they will get all the credit for costs coming down.  Even though it is very slightly, they will get the credit, and Republicans will be left out to dry, which means the American Dream--freedom, entrepreneurship, the ability to decide what health care you need, when, without government or an insurance company telling you otherwise--that dream of personal independence will be gone, and you will see a new America that begins to reflect the values of the former Soviet Union, which anybody that studies history like I majored in and never quit studying, you know there has never, ever been a time when socialism succeeded. It always has failed. It always will fail.  Even the Apostle Paul's effort to bring into the common storehouse and share and share alike, eventually he realized his error and that it is going to work in Heaven, but it is not going to work here. So, new rule: If you don't work, you don't eat.  The Pilgrims, just a beautiful Compact: Bring into the common storehouse, share and share alike. But after so many died that first winter, they realized: Maybe it will work out better if we let people have private property and they get to keep, use however they want, whatever they produce. What a great idea.  That kind of entrepreneurship, that kind of encouragement and incentive in this world for people to do well, to control their own destiny, is what made America the greatest country in the history of the world.  Now, as we proceeded over the years, we have moved toward more and more socialism, especially in the last 50 years. We have now allowed people like Bill Ayers to take over our educational facilities. They have been successful.  I understand 30, 40 percent of young people coming out of college today think that socialism would be a good thing. Well, it would be in a perfect world, where everybody worked as hard as they could and then shared and shared alike, but we have seen in this world that will never work. The only way socialism remains as long as it does, as it did in the Soviet Union, is if you have a ruthless totalitarian government that takes people's freedom away. But even then, it is all going to be for nothing.  We have an article from Mark Miller in Reuters, and the title is: ``Republican Health Reform Is the Real Disaster for Older Americans.''  One of the things I have got to say, Mr.Speaker, I was hoping in our bill--since we know and we have talked about all these years since ObamaCare passed that it cuts $716 billion from Medicare, and seniors need help. They are beginning to experience rationed health care the way the VA has been administering to our veterans for too long.  Hopefully, we will get that fixed. I don't know the person that President Trump appointed to head up the She has been part of the VA system, so I am concerned she may not be able to deliver on reenergizing the VA to actually help veterans.  With all the problems that have existed across the Veterans Administration, which are a clear example of what happens when a federal government takes complete charge of a medical system, and with all the veterans we have in record numbers committing suicide because they just feel so hopeless--they feel like there is nowhere to turn. The VA doesn't help them. They have got nowhere to turn, and they do take that irreversible step of hopelessness. People that are seeing that in the VA now are coming and saying they want the Federal Government to have more control over people's health care, kind of like the VA, because that is such a good thing.                              {time}  1215  Do we need more people killing themselves in the general society at the levels of our precious veterans?  I mean, let's take care of our veterans. Let's drop that to zero for veterans and let's work on it for the general population.  I do believe that the bill that my friend Tim Murphy helped push through, did such a great job on--it was bipartisan; we had people on both sides of the aisle working fervently on that bill--I think will be able to do some good. For 30 years or so the pendulum swung too far against people getting the mental health care they needed. So it is good to see that change.  But, Mr.Speaker, this bill--I left at the end of the week last week, and I know a lot of people were down, and I was in part, but the other side was. I really felt like this was going to be a good week, we were going to come together, we were going to discuss, we were going to find a way to come together. I thought on Tuesday--Monday evening, as I saw our leadership getting together with members of our party, I thought: Yeah, I bet we can get something by the end of the week. I got the feeling most of the Republicans felt if we don't have a bill that we can agree on and get passed for the good of the American people, let's actually take steps.  Okay, our leadership said we can't repeal Well, let's repeal at least as much as we can. Let's at least repeal as much as we did 2 years ago. Let's at least not give more power to Health and Human Let's at least take out some of the requirements from ObamaCare that have caused premiums to skyrocket. We are told: Well, trust HHS because they will be able to help bring down premiums so we don't have to take that action in this body ourselves.  For all of those who were ignorant and didn't understand, the Freedom Caucus was trying to reach an agreement so that we could vote a bill out of this House, but those of us in the Freedom Caucus all had heard over and over from constituents: You have got to do something to bring down the cost of our health insurance, of our health care. Our deductible is too high, we will never be able to get to our insurance help. Our premiums are so high.  I heard from businesspeople that their costs have tripled in the last few years. They cannot afford to stay in business and keep paying these high premiums for their employees. They will have to leave them high and dry, which means they go to And I am really shocked that even people in the Obama administration would brag about adding millions of people to Medicaid, which has not been the help that people needed. We were told: Oh, no, ObamaCare will drive them to great insurance.  No; it has driven millions to Medicaid that is even worse than  So I know most of the Republicans on this side of the aisle believe that so many States have good solutions. So what is our solution to help the States?  Gee, if we give more power to the Federal Government, then they could start a high-risk pool that will be able to pull people out of the insurance policies where premiums are spiking, and then the Federal Government will run that for a while and then devolve it back to the  I am sorry, Mr.Speaker, in my time in Congress and even my time on the bench as a judge and chief justice, I have watched government, and I just don't trust government. That was something I shared with our That was something Justice Scalia told to a group from my home in There were probably 50 or 60 seniors who came up.  I asked: Is there something special you would like to see or do while you are here?  They said: Well, you seem to be friends with Justice Do you think we could meet him?  Well, I will ask. Well, son of a gun, Justice Scalia found the time, and we met him over at the Supreme  He said: Well, what questions do you have?  He didn't start with a speech.  He said: Well, okay, Louie said you wanted to meet me. Here I am. What questions have you got?  He leaned back against the table at the front of the room, and nobody said anything.  He said: Oh, come on, I have taken time. I want to come here and let you meet me.[[Page H2587]]  I loved how abrupt he was and straight to the point.  He said: Come on, here I am, have the courage, ask your question.  One of our seniors said: Well, Justice Scalia, would you say that the United States is the most free country in the history of the world because of our Bill of Rights, that it is the best ever?  Justice Scalia surprised me, but then I thought, well, yeah, he is exactly right.  He said: Oh, gosh, no. The Soviets had a better bill of rights than we have. It had a lot more rights in there. No, no, no. The reason we are the most free country in the history of the world is because the Founders did not trust government. So they gave us a Constitution that tried to put as many obstacles as it possibly could between people in Washington--at the time, first New York, Philadelphia, then But people at the Federal level creating laws or regulations, they wanted it as hard as possible. That is why the President is not a Prime Minister selected by the It is why we have three branches instead of one or two. They wanted to make it hard to pass laws.  He went into further deliberation on that. It was very informative. He was exactly right. I studied the Soviet I remember in college when I was at Texas A&M I did a paper--and I got an A on it--about the Soviet Constitution, the Soviet rights. They did have more rights spelled out. But the trouble is, their founders wanted government to do things, and trusted government implicitly so that it was totalitarian, so the bill of rights they wrote meant nothing, the Constitution meant nothing.  That is where we are headed here, it is with bureaucrats having taken charge over people's lives, their health care, their financial situations, usurping or at least getting copies of people's finance records. You used to have to get a warrant to do that.  Now the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just gets them when they want to. That should be illegal. It should be unconstitutional. It should require a warrant with probable cause established under oath that a crime has been committed and this person probably committed it. I used to sign warrants if probable cause was established. Not anymore.  Under Obama, the Democratic Congress passed a law saying: Yeah, let them do whatever they want to somehow help us with our financial situation.  Well, when you combine what they have done with what the NSA, CIA, and Justice Department have done to invade people's rights, we are severely limited in the privacy we once had.  I know there were people who were shocked that Congress passed a bill regarding internet privacy rights, but the fact is that our party should have done a better job of getting the message out of what it really did. It just repealed the intrusion that the Obama administration had with regulation and got us back to where we were a few years ago. So there are still protections; it is just not the intrusiveness of the Federal Government that President Obama created.  Some of us were convinced that he was not as concerned with privacy rights as we were or as others in America were, and he was not as concerned about the United States' control of the internet as we were because he gives away the ability to do websites to an international group instead of trusting the United That is different. President Obama didn't trust the United States to be fair to the world. Those of us in Congress, at least on our side of the aisle, thought we would do a better job. I still think we will do a better job.  What has been heartbreaking the last day and a half is to see it doesn't appear that Republican leaders are trying to work with conservatives to get to a solution. We have now seen the solution is: go to war with those who want to stand on the Constitution; contact everybody who donates to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the National Republican Party, contact the big donors who donate to candidates; and make sure they send messages to all the Republicans that they better get on board and vote for a bill that those people who are calling never read, like some of us have, and that they didn't research. They are just trusting the people they have been donating to to do the right thing.  If that were the case, Republicans would have repealed ObamaCare a long time ago, and it would have been the first thing we took up in January, and we would never have had ObamaCare because Republicans would have stopped it when we did have the chance. We had multiple chances. But that is another story for another day.  So I am sorry, this bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority. But that is not my number one concern. Yes, it bothers me that I think this bill could lead to our loss of majority in 2018; and, yes, it concerns me that, from what I am hearing from friends across the aisle, the first thing they want to do if they get the majority in 2018 is impeach and remove from office Donald  So it has really been amazing to see the war develop the last day and a half, that those in October who stood with the President when our leaders were saying: Forget Our numbers are clear, he has no chance of winning. So our best hope is for every Republican Member to save yourself. Win your election so that when Hillary Clinton is President next January, we can, in the House, rein her in.  But I am so grateful the rank and file of our party stood fast and said: No, if Trump doesn't win, we are not going to rein in president Hillary She will do whatever she wants.  Heck, we couldn't even get our party to impeach Koskinen when the guy clearly lied to us here. Other members of the Cabinet in the Obama administration clearly lied, and we couldn't get our group together to remove perjuring people from the Cabinet?  At least now, hopefully, we are going to get the documentation that shows the kind of crimes that were being committed in the last administration.  But in the meantime, people are hurting. They need their premiums to come down. I know we can trust Health and Human Services in this administration to try to bring down costs. But the words of my late friend Justice Scalia: If you guys in Congress, with the power to repeal a bad bill, don't have the guts to do it, don't come running across the street to us and ask us to repeal your bad bill. Heck, just go to the floor, repeal the bad law, and leave us alone.  That is all I am asking, Mr.The courts have not worked out extremely well for people who love the Constitution in recent years, and I know the President is frustrated. He is probably nearly as frustrated as I am almost maybe. I am told that maybe some of these anti-Freedom Caucus tweets originated with his Chief of Staff  But I want to suggest, as Sam Rayburn did when he was Speaker: My friends, Mr.Speaker, the Republican brothers and sisters are not your enemy.

3608,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, when they write the history of our times, I am sure that when it comes to Senate history, this is going to be a chapter, a monumental event in the history of the Senate not for the better but for the worse. After we are all long dead and gone, somebody may be looking back and trying to figure out what happened or what motivated people.  I am going to tell you what has motivated me since I have been in the Senate: an understanding that the job of a Senator, when it comes to advice and consent, is not to replace my judgment for that of the President, not to nullify the election, but to be a check and balance to make sure that the President of either party nominated someone who is qualified for the job and is capable from a character point of view of being a judge for all of us, having the intellect, background, judgment, experience to carry out the duties of a Supreme Court  When President Obama won the White House, I suspected that he would pick judges who I would not have chosen, based on our different philosophies of liberal-conservative jurisprudence.  This is what Greg Craig, the former White House Counsel in the Obama administration, said about Elena Kagan, who is now on the Court: ``Kagan is . . . a progressive in the mold of Obama himself.''  This is what Vice President Biden's Chief of Staff Ronald Klain said about Elena Kagan: ``Elena Kagan is clearly a legal progressive . . . [and] comes from the progressive side of the spectrum.''  I think that was an accurate description of her and Sonia Sotomayor, who both are progressive Justices who come from the progressive side of the judicial spectrum. Both are highly qualified, capable women who had stellar legal records. Even though they had outcomes I did not agree with, they were certainly in the mainstream. Both had been judges. I think he chose people I would not have chosen, but they were really highly qualified.  I was the only member of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side to vote for either Justice Kagan or Justice Sotomayor because I used a standard that I thought was constitutionally sound. I am not telling any other Senator what they should do. I am just trying to explain what I did. In the Federalist Papers, 76, written April 1, 1788, Mr.Hamilton said:       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the      Senate? It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of      favoritism in the It would portend greatly to      prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state      prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment,      and from a view to popularity.  So, from Hamilton's point of view, it was a check and balance against a crony or unqualified person, someone who was popular but not qualified for the job, somebody who was supported because they were close to the President and not qualified for the job, someone who was appointed because they were a favorite son of a particular That would not be fair to everybody else. When you look at the history of the advice and consent clause,[[Page S2401]]it is pretty clear that the Founding Fathers did not have in their minds that one party would nullify the election when the President of another party was chosen by the people when it came to Supreme Court confirmations because they chose somebody they did not agree with philosophically.  I voted for Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, knowing they come from the progressive judicial pool. Neil Gorsuch is one of the finest conservatives that any Republican President could have chosen, and he is every bit as qualified as they were. His record is incredible--10\1/2\ years on the bench, 2,700 cases, and 1 reversal. He received the highest rating of the American Bar Association, ``well qualified,'' just like Sonia Sotomayor and Elena  To merit the committee's rating of ``well qualified,'' a Supreme Court nominee must be a preeminent member of the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience, meet the very high standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. The rating of ``well qualified'' is reserved for those found to merit the committee's strongest affirmative endorsement. By unanimous vote on March 9, the standing committee awarded Judge Gorsuch this highest rating of ``well qualified,'' just like they did for Sonia Sotomayor and Elena He has 2,700 court decisions, 1 reversal, and praise from all areas of the law--left, right and middle. The ABA report of 900 cases describes a very thoughtful man, an incredible judge, and a good person. So I don't think anybody could come to the floor and say--even though they may disagree with the outcome--that Judge Gorsuch is not qualified, using any reasonable standard, to be chosen by President He is every bit as qualified as the two Obama appointments. So, clearly, qualifications no longer matter like they used to.  Antonin Scalia--whom Judge Gorsuch, hopefully, will soon replace as Justice Gorsuch--was confirmed by the Senate 98 to 0. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3. I would argue that you could not find two more polar opposite people when it comes to philosophy than Justice Ginsburg and Justice They became very dear friends, but nobody in their right mind would say there is not a difference in their judicial philosophy.

3579,topic-id,1070,"Mr.President, within the next hour or so, we will learn whether the minority will come to their senses or whether they will engage in the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. All indications are that they are committed to their course. That is unfortunate. It truly is.  The question one has to ask is this: What, exactly, is so objectionable about this nominee that he should be subjected to the first partisan filibuster in U.history? Is he, really, not well qualified?  He attended Columbia for his bachelor's, Harvard for law school, Oxford for his doctorate. He clerked for not one--but two--Supreme Court He has spent over 10 years on the circuit court and has heard 2,700 cases. It is clear, then, that he is extremely well qualified.  So what is it? What makes this nominee so objectionable?  The truth is, throughout this process, the minority, led by their leader, has[[Page S2386]]been desperately searching for a justification for their preplanned filibuster. Over the course of the last couple of months, they have trotted out one excuse after another, but nothing will stick.  They said he isn't mainstream, but that is not true. Everyone from Obama's Solicitor General to Rachel Maddow has said he is mainstream. They said he isn't independent, but everyone knows he is an independent judge. He is his own man, and he understands the role of a judge.  Then they roll out this ridiculous argument that he is for the big guy and against the little guy. Even liberal law professors like Noah Feldman made fun of that attack. He called it ``a truly terrible idea.'' Then they said we should hold him responsible for the legal positions he took on behalf of the U.The only problem there is, we have had a lot of nominees who have represented the U.They worked for it; the government was their client. The other side certainly didn't want to hold Justice Kagan responsible for taking the truly extreme position as Solicitor General that the U.Government was constitutionally permitted to ban pamphlets. So that argument fell flat as well.  Then, of course, after they ran out of substantive arguments against the judge and his record, they resorted to attacks on his supporters or the President who nominated him or the selection process, anything--anything--to distract from the judge and the stellar record he has.  They trotted out this absurd claim that we should reject the judge not because of some opinion he has written but because those who support his nomination have the gall to actually speak out and make their voices heard, except they forgot to check with their own supporters first to make sure none of them are spending so-called dark money. Of course, they are spending money on issue advocacy, just as the law permits and the Constitution protects under the First  As we all know, issue advocacy during Supreme Court nominations is absolutely nothing new. Those who are complaining about issue advocacy today don't seem to remember the TV ads the far left ran attacking Judge Bork in 1987. I remember those ads. I remember the ads the left ran against Justice Thomas as well. Of course, outside groups on the left have attacked every Republican nominee since.  So expressing selective outrage over issue advocacy doesn't advance their cause either, but they still keep it up.  Finally, the talking point we have heard repeated most often over the last 24 hours is that Candidate Trump ``outsourced'' his selection process to conservative groups. I must say, I find that argument the oddest of all. It is the kind of thing Justice Scalia would call ``pure applesauce.''  The President didn't outsource the selection process to conservative groups. He made his list public for the entire country to review during the campaign--the first President to do that. If anything, he outsourced the selection process to whom? The voters--the American people.  So what do you do? You are out of substantive arguments from the other side. Even shots fired at the judge's supporters somehow boomerang back and hit your own advocacy groups. We have seen all of this before. I have been through a few of these debates over the years. When a Republican occupies the Oval Office, the nominees may change, but the attacks remain the same.  You will hear today the same poll-tested catch phrases we have all heard time and again. You will hear words and phrases like ``outside the mainstream,'' ``far right,'' and ``extreme.'' Invariably, these are words the left tries to pin on every nominee of a Republican President and the people he submits to the With each nominee, the playbook on the left seems to be the very same. The nomination process, it seems, is a desperate attempt to retell the same old preordained narrative.  As I have said, those of us who have been through a few of these episodes have heard it all before, and we are going to hear it in the next few hours again, but this time something is very different. This time, they intend to use the same old preordained narrative to justify the first partisan filibuster in the 220-year history of the United Of course, this result was preordained because as the minority leader said weeks before the President was even sworn into office, ``it's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we [Democrats] could support.''  You have already committed to the far left that you will launch the first partisan filibuster in U.history. So you are stuck. You have to press forward, don't you, even though you know the effort is doomed to fail. You know he will be confirmed, and you know in your heart of hearts he deserves to be confirmed. That is why this is an especially sad state of affairs, and I hope my colleagues will change their minds.  At the end of the day, we are left with an exceptional nominee, with impeccable credentials and broad bipartisan support. In short, we have in Judge Gorsuch a nominee who proves without a doubt that the minority leader would lead a filibuster against anyone nominated by this That is unfortunate because it is not the way it has to be, but it is a situation we cannot accept.

3617,topic-id,1690,"Mr.President, we are now well on our way to confirming Judge Gorsuch as the next Justice of the Supreme I have a few things to say about the way we have gotten here.  Earlier today, the other side--meaning the Democrats--made a very unprecedented break with Senate history and with Senate tradition. They launched the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history. For our part, we Republicans insisted that we follow the practice of the We don't engage in partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees.  Yesterday, I came to the floor to speak about the path that brought us to this point. As I discussed, way back in 2001, the current minority leader and some of his allies on the far left hatched a plan to, in their words, ``change the ground rules'' with regard to lower court nominees. I noted a New York Times article describing the Democratic senatorial caucus retreat, where the new approach to nominees was discussed; in other words, where they discussed the strategy for changing the ground rules of how judges are considered by the United States  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the May 1, 2001, New York Times article entitled ``Washington talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight,'' and the April 5, 2017, story from the Washington Examiner entitled ``The Gorsuch Plagiarism Story is Bogus.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2001]         Washington Talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight                           (By Neil Lewis)       President Bush has yet to make his first nominee to a      federal court and no one knows whether anyone will retire      from the Supreme Court this summer, an event that would lead      to a high-stakes confirmation battle.[[Page S2407]]       Nonetheless, the Senate's Democrats and Republicans are      already engaged in close-quarters combat over how to deal      with the eventual nominees from the Bush White      Democrats in particular are trying to show some muscle as      they insist that they will not simply stand aside and confirm      any nominees they deem right-wing ideologues.       ``What we're trying to do is set the stage and make sure      that both the White House and the Senate Republicans know      that we expect to have significant input in the process,''      Senator Charles Schumer, New York's senior Democrat, said      in an interview. ``We're simply not going to roll over.''       Forty-two of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private      retreat this weekend in Farmington, Pa., where a principal      topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the      White House on judicial nominees.       The senators listened to a panel composed of Laurence      Tribe of Harvard Law School, Cass Sunstein of the      University of Chicago Law School and Marcia Greenberger,      the co-director of the National Women's Law Center, on the      need to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.      The panelists argued, said some people who were present, that      the nation's courts were at a historic juncture because, they      said, a band of conservative lawyers around Mr.Bush was      planning to pack the courts with staunch conservatives.       ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the      ground rules and there was no obligation to confirm someone      just because they are scholarly or erudite,'' a person who      attended said.       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,      then exhorted his colleagues behind closed doors on Saturday      morning to refrain from providing snap endorsements of any      Bush nominee. One senior Democratic Senate staff aide who      spoke on the condition of anonymity said that was because      some people still remembered with annoyance the fact that two      Democratic senators offered early words of praise for the      nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney general.       Senators Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Joseph      Biden of Delaware initially praised the Ashcroft      selection, impeding the early campaign against the      nomination. Both eventually acceded to pressure and voted      against the nomination.       The current partisan battle is over a parliamentary custom      that Republicans are considering changing, which governs      whether a senator may block or delay a nominee from his home      state. Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee      have not resolved their dispute over the ``blue-slip policy''      that allows senators to block a nominee by filing a blue slip      with the committee.       On Friday, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking      Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr.Schumer sent a      letter to the White House signed by all committee Democrats      insisting on a greater role in selecting judges, especially      given that the Senate is divided 50-50 and that the      Republicans are the majority only because Vice President Dick      Cheney is able to break any tie.       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,      told reporters today that he believed ``some consideration      will be given to Democratic input, but I don't think they      should expect to name judges from their state.''       Mr.Lott said he expected that Democrats might slow the      process but, in the end, would not block any significant      number of nominees.       Behind all the small-bore politics is the sweeping issue of      the direction of the federal courts, especially the 13      circuit courts that increasingly have the final word on some      of the most contentious social issues. How the federal bench      is shaped in the next four or eight years, scholars say,      could have a profound effect on issues like affirmative      action, abortion rights and the lengths to which the      government may go in aiding parochial schools.       Mr.Bush is expected to announce his first batch of      judicial nominees in the next several days, and it is likely      to include several staunch conservatives as well as some      women and members of minorities, administration officials      have said.

The reports alleged he also lifted      material for an academic article published in 2000.       The charge, which involves Gorsuch repeating medical terms      and not original concepts or ideas, is weak, at best.       ``[The similar] passage are factual, not analytical in      nature, framing both the technical legal and medical      circumstances of the `Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in      1982,'' Kuzma explained. ``Given that these passages both      describe the basic facts of the case, it would have been      awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to have used      different language.''       BuzzFeed was first to report on the similarities between      Gorsuch and It published a story Tuesday headlined,      ``A Short Section in Neil Gorsuch's 2006 Book Appears To Be      Copied From A Law Review       Politico followed suit publishing a story titled,      ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors.''

Georgetown University's John Keown, who reviewed Gorsuch's      dissertation, said elsewhere in a statement: ``The allegation      is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its      citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is      guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary      sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly,      absurd.       Indeed, the book's reliance on primary rather than      secondary sources is one of its many strengths.''       Further, actual attorneys disagree that Gorsuch plagiarized      anything.       ``People unfamiliar with legal writing, or even writing,      may be unfamiliar with how citations work,'' Attorney Thomas      Crown explained Wednesday.'' When I cite to a case or      statute, if I am quoting verbatim, I give a direct quotation,      with apostrophes and everything, and then the source. If I am      summarizing, sometimes even using the same words, I follow      with the direct citation. The Bluebook, which is the legal      style Bible, is for law reviews and some appellate and trial      courts, and has more specific rules.       ``I mention this because this is standard across numerous      fields, not just law, and only illiterates . . . are      shocked,'' he added. ``Different field with different      standards and forms; but even most academics believe that a      good synopsis with citation isn't plagiarism.''

3618,topic-id,1020,"After a brief time in the majority, Senate Democrats were back in the minority in 2003--so approximately 2 years after they had this strategy. It was at that time the Senate Democrats began an unprecedented and systemic filibuster of President George Bush's circuit court nominees.  Then the tables turned. President Obama was elected, and Republicans held the Senate minority. At that time, even though many of us did not like the idea of using the filibuster on judicial nominees, we also recognized that we could not have two sets of rules--one for Republican Presidents and one for Democratic  Our party defeated two nominees for the lower courts by filibuster and denied cloture to three of President Obama's nominees to the DC Circuit Court of But the other side did not appreciate being subject to the rules that they first established and started using in 2003 to filibuster judges.

I say that because the rules of the Senate say it takes a two-thirds vote to change the[[Page S2408]]rules of the Senate, but they changed it by a majority vote. Now at that time, as we all know, Majority Leader Reid changed the rules for all Cabinet nominations and lower court nominees. To say that my colleagues and I were disappointed is a gross understatement.  The majority claimed that they left intact the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. But my view back in 2013, when they did that, was that the distinction Majority Leader Reid drew between lower court nominees and Supreme Court nominees was not a meaningful one. My view, in 2013, was that Majority Leader Reid had effectively eliminated the filibuster for both lower court nominees and the Supreme  Here is the reason. There are two circumstances where this issue might conceivably arise: either you have a Democrat in the White House and a Democrat-controlled Senate or you have a Republican in the White House and a Republican-led  In the first, there was a Democrat in the White House and the party led by Leader Reid and Leader-in-Waiting Schumer was in the majority. If for some extraordinary reason Senate Republicans chose to filibuster the nominee, there is no question that a Majority Leader Reid or a Majority Leader Schumer would change the rules.  Now, I do not believe that this particular circumstance would ever arise, because our side does not believe in filibustering Supreme Court nominees. I have never voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, not once. I think I have a pretty good sense of the rest of our caucus. Our side just does not believe in it. It is not much more complicated than that simple commonsense statement I just made.  Of course, even if for some extraordinary reason our side did choose to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, we do not have to speculate as to whether the other side would have changed the precedent with respect to the Supreme Last year, when everyone thought that Secretary Clinton was going to win the election, their own Vice-Presidential candidate said that they would change the rules if they needed to if we had a Republican filibuster.  Then, of course, the other circumstance where this issue would arise is what we have seen this very day--a Republican in the White House and a Republican-controlled We saw this very day that the minority was willing to take that last step and engage in the first partisan filibuster in U.history.  As I have repeatedly discussed, because they were willing to do it with a nominee as well-qualified as Judge Gorsuch, it proved, without a shadow of a doubt, that they would filibuster any one submitted by this Republican That is why, on the day that Majority Leader Reid took that unprecedented action in 2013 to break the Senate rules to change the Senate rules, I spoke on the floor.  I concluded my remarks this way. So I want to quote myself:       So the majority has chosen to take us down this path. The      silver lining is that there will come a day when the rolls      are reversed. When that happens, our side will likely      nominate and confirm lower court and Supreme Court nominees      with 51 votes, regardless of whether the Democrats actually      buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish the      filibuster on the lower court nominees and still preserve it      for the Supreme Court nominees.  That is what I said when Reid took that extraordinary step. So though I am extremely pleased that we will confirm such an exceptional nominee to the Supreme Court in the next day or so, I am, of course, disappointed with what we were forced to do to get it done. Sadly, I cannot say I am surprised. I think my surprise, or the fact that I can't be surprised--you can tell it from what I said back there, what I just quoted from the 2013 speech that I gave.  I knew when Majority Leader Reid did it in 2013 that this is where we were headed. That is where we ended earlier this afternoon. But the bottom line is that you cannot have two sets of rules. You cannot clothe yourself in the tradition of a filibuster while simultaneously conducting the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history. You cannot demand a rules change only when it suits the Democratic Members of this body.  You just can't have it both ways. You can't use the Senate rules as both a shield and a sword. But I must say, the one thing that does not disappoint me is this: The nominee to take Justice Scalia's seat is eminently qualified. He will apply the law faithfully without respect to persons. He is a judge's judge. Come some time tomorrow, we will all start calling him Justice  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Blunt).

3539,topic-id,690,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce my first bill in the U.Senate--a bill to help relieve the burden of student debt for young entrepreneurs from New Hampshire and the entire country.  Most of us have seen personally how heavily the burden of student loan debt weighs on students and families across New Less visible, but no less important, is how student loan debt is weighing down our economy--stifling innovation and job creation.  Student loan debt is preventing the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators from opening their own businesses. A New York Times report highlighted that the percentage of new entrepreneurs between 20-34 years old fell to 25 percent in 2014, down from almost 35 percent in 1996. And Gallup found that 19 percent of graduates with student loan debt say they have delayed starting a business because of it.  It is time to once again unleash the entrepreneurial potential of our young people into creating the jobs of the future. That is why this week I introduced the Reigniting Opportunity for Innovators, ROI, Act, the first bill I am writing as a U.Senator, which would help provide the relief necessary for young entrepreneurs to start up and grow innovative small businesses.  The ROI Act will allow eligible founders and full-time employees of certified small business to defer their Federal student loan payments and interest accrual for up to 3 years while launching a startup. This will help give graduates the financial stability they need to take the risk of starting a business that can create good-paying jobs.  Additionally, this legislation provides an additional incentive for startup companies to move off the beaten path to help revitalize struggling communities. If the startup is located in an economically distressed area, founders and employees will be eligible for cancellation of up to $20,000 in student loans.  The ROI Act is an important step that we can take now to help young entrepreneurs and lay the foundation for a new generation of economic growth.  New businesses are historically the top job creators in our country, and small businesses are the driving force of New Hampshire's economy. But to get the education they need to compete for jobs in the 21st century economy, students are taking on more debt than ever before. In 2015, college graduates left school with an average of $30,000 of student loan debt, and New Hampshire students had the highest average student debt in the country.  At a roundtable discussion at Keene State College, I heard from students about the challenges posed by their student loan debt. One young woman told me that she hoped to start her own business but that she would likely have to put off that goal for another 10 years because of her student loan debt.  Any entrepreneur will tell you that getting a small business off the ground is expensive. These costs, mixed with student loan debt, make it even more daunting for young entrepreneurs to consider taking the leap of starting a new business. Student debt decreases the cash flow of potential entrepreneurs, it hurts their ability to build equity, and it can negatively affect credit scores and their ability to secure financing.  With the deck too often stacked against them, we need to be doing everything we can to support young entrepreneurs looking to start the innovative businesses that will drive job-creation and move our economy forward.  The ROI Act would work to drive our 21st century economy, but we know that we have more work to do to bring down the costs of higher education and ensure that New Hampshire students, families, and innovative businesses have the support they need. In addition to working to pass this commonsense legislation, I will continue to focus on expanding Pell grants, lowering interest rates for student loans and allowing students to refinance, and increasing apprenticeship and job training opportunities.  The ROI Act is an important step that we can take now to help young entrepreneurs and lay the foundation for a new generation of economic growth, and I look forward to working with members of both parties to pass this commonsense bill.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2365.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,4.0,March
3447,topic-id,927,"Mr.President, I rise to briefly discuss a number of ongoing efforts in the early days of the 115th It is a strange time to be working on Capitol Hill, as strange as I have seen in my four decades in the That is true for a number of reasons. Let me give you an example. Republicans currently control the Senate, the House, and the White House, and are in widespread agreement about most major policy issues. Sure, there are details that need to be worked out, both on the process and the substance on things like tax reform, trade, and of course health care reform, but by and large Republicans all have the same ultimate goals for these key areas. Yet despite the overwhelming consensus that exists on most of these issues, there seems to be an obsession with advancing a narrative of a deeply divided Republican majority. According to this popular narrative, House and Senate Republicans have completely different views on tax reform, Republicans in Congress oppose everything President Trump wants to do on trade, and Senate Republicans are deeply at odds on[[Page S703]]how to press forward on repealing and replacing  As chairman of the Senate committee that is right in the middle of all these issues, I get asked to comment on these matters, literally, dozens of times every day. The questions take many forms. Senator X says Congress should do ``blank'' with What do you think? Can the House's tax reform plan pass in the Senate? President Trump said ``blank'' today. Is that going to fly in your committee?  These questions may seem straightforward. However, the underlying question behind all of these lines of inquiry is: Will you publically disagree with or criticize another Republican so we can write another story about Republican divisions? Matters such as repealing and replacing ObamaCare or reforming the Tax Code are certainly important topics that are rightly under intense public scrutiny. However, given that these monumental efforts are still in the early stages, the fact that there are some relatively minor differences of opinion shouldn't be all that noteworthy. The existence of these differences in the initial stages of the process doesn't significantly jeopardize the success of these efforts. The purpose of the legislative process--particularly the process we use in the Senate--is to allow differences to be aired and worked through so, at the end of the process, consensus can be reached. Differing views on some issues at the beginning of the process are to be expected. Once again, they are hardly noteworthy.  Case in point, Republicans are united in our desire to repeal and replace The vast majority of us want reforms that are more patient-centered and market-driven. As far as I know, pretty much all of us want to return most of the authority for regulating the health care system back to the On some of the other questions, let me make clear what my position is just so there is no confusion on these points. I believe we should repeal ObamaCare--including the taxes--and provide for a stable transition period. I believe the work to replace ObamaCare should also begin immediately, meaning that our repeal bill should include as many ObamaCare replacement policies as procedures allow. A more complete replacement can and should be crafted in the coming months as we work through some of the more complicated issues. That has been my position since roughly March of 2010, when the final pieces of ObamaCare were signed into law. I have repeated it numerous times over the years. Moreover, I believe most Republicans in Congress share that same view.  Do some Republicans have different views regarding the proper order and procedure for this endeavor? I am sure they do. But I don't know of a single Republican who does not want to get rid of I certainly don't know any Republicans who are fine with the status quo in our health care system. That being the case, no one should be trying to parse anyone's words or split hairs in order to manufacture divisions in the Republican ranks on repealing and replacing  I have little doubt that we can work through whatever differences do exist, and, more importantly, I think we will. I am not going to speculate today on the floor about what the final process or product will look like, but I will say that at the end of the day, only 3 numbers matter: 218, 51 and 1. Those are the numbers of supporters we need at each step to pass an ObamaCare repeal and replacement.  At this point, given what we currently know, I strongly believe that the process I described earlier--a full repeal and a responsible transition, coupled with a sizable downpayment on replacement, followed by a committed effort to implement additional replacement policies in the coming months--provides the best path forward to achieving those thresholds. Like I said, most Republicans in Congress agree with me.  We can discuss other ideas, and I am happy to engage in that discussion, but those numbers--218, 51, and 1--have to be the standard by which we judge any alternatives. And while I would love to see the final product pass with even larger numbers, and even with some Democrats onboard with us, those numbers give us a clear picture as to how much consensus is necessary.  Once again, I think we can get there, and I am continually working with colleagues in both the House and Senate to make sure we do.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from New  ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS685-7.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,6.0,March
3783,topic-id,1919,"Mr.President, as we approach the end of another week in the Senate with a 2-week recess on the horizon, I think it is a good time to reflect on where we are on various high-profile efforts and to talk about the pathways forward.  As is generally the case when any new administration comes into office, the Republican majorities in both the House and Senate began 2017 with an ambitious agenda in order to make good on the promises we have made to the American people over the last several years. Many of the key items on the agenda fall squarely in the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair. That being the case, my colleagues on the committee and I have been hard at work, trying to find the right solutions on things like healthcare, tax reform, and trade policy.  I don't think I am going to surprise anyone when I say it hasn't been easy. Honestly, I think that might be the biggest understatement of the year.  Things have been difficult for a number of reasons. One reason is that we are coming off of a bitter election year, one that shocked a number of our colleagues. After a hotly contested campaign, it can sometimes take a while for things to return to normal. However, I don't think that excuses the tactics and rhetoric we have seen from our friends on the other side of the aisle.[[Page S2145]]  In any of these big-ticket policy efforts, whether we are talking about repealing and replacing ObamaCare, fixing the Tax Code, or updating America's trade policy, cooperation between the legislative and the executive branches is key. My Democratic colleagues know this, which, I suppose, is probably the reason they appeared to be bound and determined to prevent any meaningful cooperation from happening.  Now don't get me wrong; I don't expect my friends to change their views and back policies that they find disagreeable. However, you would think, at the very least, that they would allow the new President to get his team in place, a courtesy that has typically been extended to past Presidents, regardless of party. Yet over the last few months, we have seen a systematic effort from our Democratic colleagues to smear, attack, and undermine the vast majority of executive branch nominees. In many cases, after the baseless attacks have failed to gain traction, they have used every procedural tool at their disposal, including surprise boycotts of committee markups, in order to slow down the confirmation process.  This level of obstruction with regard to nominees is unprecedented. And I think it is safe to say that it has slowed our efforts down somewhat, which, I suppose, is the exact reason our colleagues have taken this path. Still, despite these childish tactics, the teams are coming together, and we are moving forward in a number of key areas. As I said, it still hasn't been easy, but to paraphrase a number of important figures, nothing worth doing is ever easy.  For example, on healthcare, I think it is safe to say that the ongoing effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare took a hit last week, but I don't think that has weakened anyone's resolve. ObamaCare is a disaster, and one way or another, it has to go away. The American people are demanding that we take action, and I expect that the volume of those demands is only going to go up.  I commend Speaker Ryan for his efforts thus far, and I commend all my colleagues in the House and Senate for their commitment to repealing and replacing the so-called Affordable Care I remain hopeful that in the near future we can find a workable path forward, and that includes my Democratic colleagues as well.  On tax reform we have some indications that the Trump administration intends to be more actively engaged in finding and developing a path forward. I have said for years that if we are going to be successful in tax reform--a goal shared by Members of both parties--it is going to take Presidential leadership and cooperation by both parties. While President Obama was generally unwilling to meaningfully engage on tax reform, President Trump and his team appear to be anxious to drive the process, and I welcome that.  As with healthcare reform, there are some differences of opinion with regard to tax reform. Still, I think there is a remarkable amount of agreement, at least among Republicans, on the major issues we need to deal with to fix our broken Tax  Overall, I would say that the Republicans in the Senate, the House, and the White House agree on about 80 percent of the major tax reform issues, and a number of key and fundamental questions are answered in that 80 percent. For example, we all generally agree on the need for comprehensive reform. We agree on the need to bring down tax rates for businesses and job creators. We agree that we need a simplified rate structure on the individual side. We agree on the need to fix the international tax rules to level the playing field for American companies and encourage more investment in the United States, and we generally agree on key process issues, including the appropriate revenue baselines and the use of macroeconomic analysis in budget scoring.  Still, that 20 percent of issues where we don't necessarily agree is not insignificant. We will need to find a consensus path forward on those issues as well. One area where we have yet to reach a consensus--and the one getting the most attention--is on the proposed border adjustment tax. People have a number of opinions about this, and I have had numerous people in my office on both sides of the issue. As I said, there are a number of opinions on this proposal, and they have been more than willing to express them publicly. As for myself, I am anxious to see what it looks like once our friends in the House put it all together.  It is too early for me to express a definitive position now. So at this point, all I will say is that I have some basic questions about the proposal.  For example, who will ultimately bear the tax? To what extent will it be borne by consumers, workers, shareholders, and, of course, foreigners?  Another question: Is the proposal consistent with our international trade obligations?  Finally, since border adjustability will likely be a significant shift in business tax policy, would it require us to make adjustments to ensure that we don't unduly increase the tax burden on specific industries? If so, what adjustments would be necessary, and how would they be structured?  I look forward to receiving more details on this proposal. However, here in the Senate, we also have some work to do, and I have been actively working with the members of the Finance Committee to find various solutions to our Nation's tax problems.  At the end of the day, I don't think it will surprise anyone to hear me say that I believe we are going to need to have a robust and substantive tax reform process in the In my view, it is not realistic to think that the Senate will simply take up and pass a House bill without our Members having a significant input on the substance of the bill. That is how the Congress is supposed to operate, and I think that is what will produce the best result in the end.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House on tax reform. I also appreciate the willingness of the new Treasury Secretary and the President's National Economic Council to lead on this effort, and I look forward to continuing to work with them as well.  I will also say this: My hope is that both parties can find a way to work together on tax reform. While we have procedural tools at our disposal to get tax reform legislation through Congress with strictly Republican votes, I personally believe that it would be better to find a bipartisan path forward. A bipartisan bill would allow us to put in place more lasting reforms and give the overall effort additional credibility.  I am sure there are some who think it is impossible for Republicans and Democrats to work together on something of this magnitude, but I have been in the Senate for a long time, and I think my record for bipartisanship speaks for itself. I believe we can and should work together, and I am willing to talk and work with anyone who is willing to set politics aside and engage in good faith on these matters.  I have been banging a drum on tax reform for 6 years now, and throughout that time, I have invited my Democratic colleagues to join in this effort. I will do so again today. Hopefully, some of our colleagues on the other side will take me up on this offer.  Finally, I want to say a few words about U.trade policy. Trade is another area in which President Trump has some ambitious plans and in which, up to now, progress has been hindered. Before I delve into that, let me reiterate a key point.  In 2015, Congress outlined its trade priorities with our legislation to renew the trade promotion authority, which was signed into law by President The TPA statute gives clear guidance as to what a trade agreement should look like if it is going to win Congress's approval.  President Trump was fortunate to come into office with TPA already in effect, and I am committed to working with him to enact trade agreements that meet those standards established by the TPA law. When it comes to new trade agreements or revisions to modernize existing trade agreements, that is my top priority as chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade policy. Our trade laws are designed to give Congress a voice in both the negotiation and implementation of trade agreements.  In addition to priorities and objectives outlined under TPA, there is the Office of the U.Trade Representative, which is intended to be the chief intermediary between Congress and, of course, the administration on trade[[Page S2146]]policy matters. In other words, in order for the two branches to effectively work together on trade, the Office of the USTR needs to be fully functional and fully staffed.  Unfortunately, up to now, some on the other side have been making unreasonable and wholly unrelated demands in relation to the confirmation of President Trump's nominee to be USTR even though he has support from Members of both parties. This is unfortunate. However, I am working with my colleagues to remove any remaining roadblocks, and I am hoping we can make progress on this very soon.  As one can see, we have quite a bit of work to do here in Congress, and I am only talking about a handful of the major issues before us. I am very concerned. There are, of course, many other priorities we need to address and matters we need to resolve. I am hoping that in the coming weeks and months, as we put more distance between us and the 2016 election, more of our colleagues on both sides will be amenable to working together to address these kinds of issues even if it means allowing President Trump to claim some successes.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2144.txt,1351,CYBER PREPAREDNESS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,30.0,April
3503,topic-id,931,"Madam Speaker, today I would like to share a letter I received from Sherry, who lives back in my hometown of Olympia,  Sherry writes to me:       My husband was a veteran. He worked as a civilian with high      security clearance at White Sands Missile Range and later as      a paramedic and firefighter. When I met him, I was working as      a paramedic, also. We were crazy in love. But I lost him to      cancer in 2009, at the age of 56.       Since the day my husband died, we lost his income. I had to      figure out how to raise our son, who was then 6. I sold my      business on the Oregon coast, lost my house in Newport, and      moved to Washington to be with my sister. I found Olympia a      year later and have been here since. I have qualified for      food stamps for the last 8 years. We have depended on the      food bank on and off.       When all this happened, that was before ObamaCare, and the      $1,000 monthly premium for insurance for my family was simply      not sustainable. At first, I was able to keep my insurance      through But after that ran out, we were left to paying      for some cut-rate insurance that provided very little      coverage.       When the Affordable Care Act was enacted, I finally felt      relief. I got covered through the ACA, and that allowed me to      direct some of the money I was paying to insurance toward      food, books, clothing, or tuition. My son is now 13, and 6      foot 1, with a size 14 shoe, so we go through clothes and      shoes for him like crazy.       I still struggle. I still have medical bills and      collections. I still struggle with food and clothes for both      myself and my son. I still go to the Thurston County Food      Bank in downtown But ObamaCare allows me to follow      my health closely and helps me pay for the medical care my      son and I require.       I have a spot on my lung that needs constant monitoring,      and ObamaCare has allowed me to go in for those routine      Preventative services like mammograms are also paid for.       Since my husband died, I have been focused on raising my      son and getting a higher education degree. I went to massage      school, and[[Page H1601]]     then I earned my degree at The Evergreen State I      will graduate with a master's degree in psychology in      Not only will I be employable and be able to help others in      the mental health field, I will also get to start whittling      away at paying old medical bills and my student loans.       Although I will no longer need ObamaCare since I will have      health insurance through my employer, the ACA has forever      changed the insurance marketplace. The insurers can't charge      me more for my preexisting condition like they could before.       If the ACA had been in place when my husband died, I would      have been able to keep my business on the Oregon coast. If      the ACA had been in place when my husband died, I would have      immediately qualified for insurance under the ACA, and I may      have been able to keep our house. I want you to know, I am      not lazy. I am a determined, self-improving mom who is      raising her son alone. Before the ACA, I had to decide      whether to pay for insurance or food. I depend on the  That is the letter from  Madam Speaker, this past Saturday, I had the opportunity to meet with more than 300 of my constituents who support accessible, affordable health care in our country.

We can and should make improvements in order to make healthcare insurance more affordable and more accessible to more people across our As we began this Congress, I had hope that we could have a productive, bipartisan discussion about the steps we could take to do just that, but I was saddened and, frankly, dismayed by the lack of serious policy efforts from my friends on the other side of the aisle.  Well, the majority finally released their proposed replacement for the ACA, the so-called American Health Care Act, after weeks of hiding this secret bill behind closed doors. Frankly, I am not impressed by the bill. This bill offers no attempts to improve healthcare coverage or insurance coverage, no attempts to reduce healthcare costs or the rate of inflation. This bill allows insurance to charge older people more while, at the same time, reducing the subsidies for many of those very same people. The bill was presented without any indication of how it will affect our budget or how many people will be kicked off their insurance under this plan.  This bill does not address the barriers that prevent working class and middle class people from accessing and securing health insurance. In fact, the bill would likely put health insurance out of reach for millions of Americans who are in the working and middle classes.  Madam Speaker, to earn the label ``American,'' a bill had better be exceptional. The American Health Care Act is a lot of things, but exceptional is not one of them. People like Sherry are exceptional.

I know that the White House and some in Congress are furiously working to sweep this under the rug, but only the truth will serve as a public means to move past this crisis for our democracy.  That is why I come to the Senate floor today, to address this issue before my colleagues and to help the American people sort through the details of what we know to be the undisputed facts. We know without a doubt, based on the assessment of credible intelligence, that the Russian Government hacked into Presidential campaign infrastructure and sought not only to damage Hillary Clinton but to try to help elect Donald  Russian intelligence operatives hacked into the email servers of both of our two major political parties. They chose to selectively leak information that damaged one Presidential candidate and favored the other. This is not a partisan political assessment. This is the plain truth as proven by credible intelligence gathered by the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and the military's Cyber In addition, 17 U.intelligence agencies issued a statement expressing their unanimous assessment that Moscow had penetrated State election voting centers.  During an open hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee in January of this year, FBI Director James Comey said: ``There were intrusions and attempted intrusions at the state level voter registration databases.'' Director Comey said that there was no evidence of activity on election day related to this voter registration data. However, this clearly demonstrates that this data may be vulnerable to future cyber attacks and manipulations by foreign hackers.  What happened in this last year's election is already disturbing enough. In testimony during the same Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said:[[Page S2041]]         We have high confidence that President Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.Presidential      election. The goals of this campaign were to undermine public      faith in the U.Democratic process, denigrate Secretary      [Hillary] Clinton and harm her electability and potential      presidency.  He continued: ``Putin and the Russian government also developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''  That shocking revelation at the very least begged for deeper investigation and accountability to protect our democratic institutions from foreign interference moving forward. After all, Russia did not do this to help the Republican Russia did this to help  I don't want foreign powers putting their thumb on the scales for Democrats or Republicans in our elections. Our democracy hinges on our ability to protect the voices of Americans to choose our own leaders. Nothing could be more fundamental in democracy.  You can see similar ongoing Russian efforts to work seeking to influence and undermine democratic elections in France, Germany, and throughout the West, in addition to the former Soviet states, which is why we have to take this seriously and to see through the latest news cycle, political commentary, or tweet and remain focused on following the facts, wherever they may lead us.  Unfortunately, the facts suggest that we not only need to hold the Russians accountable but that we also have reason to look into possible ties between key members of the Trump campaign and their connections to the Russian actors who we know meddled in our election.  The obvious question Americans are demanding an answer to is this: Did the Trump campaign cooperate--or even coordinate--with the Russians in their effort to help Donald Trump? It is a logical question that has striking implications not only for the Trump administration but also for our democracy as a whole.  The President and his senior advisers--both on the campaign and now in the administration--have vehemently denied any Russian connections whatsoever. Back in November, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokesman said: ``There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.''  A month ago, President Trump responded to a question in a press conference about whether anyone in his campaign had been in contact with Russia, saying:       Nobody that I know of . . . Russia is a ruse. I have      nothing to do with  I truly wish that that was what the facts had shown, but at nearly every turn, there is evidence--and, when forced, admission--that there were, in fact, communications and contact with the Russians that are not only unprecedented but truly hard to believe and to understand.  Contrary to denials, we know that senior leaders and surrogates in then-Candidate Donald Trump's campaign had contact with the Russian Government and actors behind the Russian cyber attacks and leaks.  One campaign adviser, Carter Page, traveled to Moscow in July of 2016 on a trip approved by the Trump campaign. During the trip, Page delivered a lecture that slammed U.policy toward Three days later, at the Republican National Convention, Trump campaign aides stepped in to oppose the inclusion of language in the RNC platform that called on the U.Government to send weapons to our ally Ukraine in response to Russian military aggression and the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukrainian  Despite Trump campaign denials of involvement at the time, former campaign aides have since come forward to say that, yes, they were involved in defeating that language in the platform.  While this was going on, again, despite denials to the contrary, we know that senior Trump advisers met with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak on the sidelines of the Republican  We know that then-Senator Sessions, a senior campaign surrogate, also met with Kislyak in his personal Senate office later in  Again, this communication was uncovered despite Attorney General Sessions denying it had ever taken place.  During his Senate confirmation hearing in January, then-Senator Sessions said in response to a pointed question about how he would respond as Attorney General to any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian Government in the course of the campaign:       I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been      called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I      didn't have--did not have communications with the  Then the day after the Republican National Convention, WikiLeaks posted nearly 20,000 emails hacked and stolen by Russian intelligence from the DNC server.  After this, Donald Trump, during a press conference in late July, called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's private email, saying:       I will tell you this--Russia, if you're listening, I hope      you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I      think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.  Although Trump later claimed to be joking, we now have reason to believe that one of his friends and advisers, Roger Stone, was in contact with the Russian hackers behind the cyber attacks. Stone boasted in a speech in August 2016 that he had communicated with WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange and that more damaging documents would be forthcoming in what he called an ``October surprise.''  Stone also admitted to communicating via Twitter with the Russian hacker behind the breaches who went by the moniker ``Guccifer 2.0.'' Stone tweeted out predictions that Hillary Clinton senior campaign aide John Podesta's personal emails would soon be published, saying: ``Trust me, it will soon be Podesta's time in the barrel.'' Stone also tweeted: ``I have total confidence that WikiLeaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon.''  Soon after this, WikiLeaks released its first batch of John Podesta's stolen emails and continued releasing more on a daily basis up until election day.  In the face of these facts, the Trump administration's story has evolved from rejecting Russian influence on the election entirely to denying any connection or communication with Russian actors, to asserting that this contact was, in fact, innocent or routine and that Americans should simply trust that there was nothing more going on. But to ask the public to trust you when you have falsely denied that the communication occurred in the first place is absurd on its face and, in fact, it is a plausible reason to suspect possible coordination.  After the election, we now know that President-Elect Trump's appointed National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and Trump's senior aide and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had a secret meeting with Russian Ambassador Kislyak and that Flynn later conducted phone calls with Kislyak that included discussion of rolling back sanctions for  Flynn has since resigned as National Security Advisor after having lied about the content of his conversations with  Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia due to his undisclosed meetings with the same Russian  Last week, FBI Director James Comey confirmed to the public that the FBI is currently conducting a counterintelligence investigation into possible coordination between President Trump's campaign and the  I will repeat that because I fear that the public is becoming desensitized to the gravity of what we are learning about. The President's campaign officials are under investigation by the FBI for possible links with the Russian Government, including whether they coordinated with one another to impact our Presidential election.  We also saw reports last week that before his time on the Trump campaign, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort created and then sold the Russians what appears to effectively be a playbook on how to undermine Western democracy and to further the interests of the Russian Government, including here in the United  Manafort's reported recommendations to use political campaign tactics, establish front groups, and manipulate the press cycle are strikingly similar[[Page S2042]]to the actual tactics that we know the Russians employed to undermine the 2016 Presidential election.  The Trump administration's repeated attempts to now distance itself from its former campaign chairman, a man who played a central role in the Trump campaign, is indicative of its desperate attempts to cover up the facts.  The facts are there if we just look.  The Trump campaign denied having worked to scrub the RNC platform to be friendlier to Russia but then later had to admit to having done so.  Michael Flynn denied conversations with the Russian Ambassador and then had to resign when that turned out to be a lie.  Attorney General Sessions denied having conversations with the Russians but later recused himself from the investigation after having to admit that he secretly met on several occasions with the Russian  The Trump campaign and Trump's advisers denied any communications with the Russians, but it turns out they personally met with the Russian Ambassador at the RNC, communicated with Russian hackers, and appear to have had advanced notice about impending DNC and Clinton leaks.  All of this culminates with the news that the Trump campaign chairman sold the Russians a playbook on how to conduct a strikingly similar influence operation to undermine democracy and promote the Putin agenda throughout the  This is all a complicated web of connections that we need to piece together. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am committed to finding the answers that the American people deserve and to working together with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put our Nation first and to make sure that we get to the bottom of this.  We need to do everything possible to get to the objective truth. That includes subpoenaing President Trump's tax returns and financial statements so that we can follow the money and determine who holds the debt behind the President's complex international business empire. That includes calling President Trump's associates, such as Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, Jared Kushner, Jeff Sessions, and Michael Flynn to testify before the Senate Intelligence  But with the incredible amount of information and intelligence that we need to look through, I believe we also should be open to an independent, nonpartisan commission designed solely to investigate what happened.  During the investigation of Watergate and the ensuing scandal, Congress conducted a thorough select oversight investigation at the same time that an independent special prosecutor was pursuing a case to uncover the truth. All of those avenues proved to be essential to discovering the crimes and coverup that were committed.  If we do not take this seriously, our fundamental democratic institutions are at risk. History will judge severely those of us in this body tasked with finding the whole truth and determining conclusively whether or not associates of the Trump campaign coordinated or cooperated with this effort to undermine our American democracy.  We cannot allow political pressure or unsubstantiated distractions to get in the way of simply following the facts.  I don't think it is hyperbolic to state that the fate of our democracy depends on our ability to thoroughly and carefully get to the truth here. Until we are able to find out the full extent of Russia's operations and ensure that we set up protections against similar actions going forward, our democratic institutions will remain vulnerable.  I want my constituents in New Mexico and all of the American people to know that I remain committed to seeing this important mission through and following the facts, wherever they may lead.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

I recently heard from a constituent, Karissa, who works with the Boys & Girls Club in my district in Bryant,  One of her mentees was struggling, having trouble in school, finding it difficult to build friendships with her fellow students.

At-risk youth face many difficult challenges, and life is infinitely more challenging without the support of caring adults.  With mentors, at-risk youth are less likely than their peers to skip school or use drugs and are more likely to go to college, play sports, and volunteer in our communities.

3738,topic-id,537,"Mr.Speaker, I rise out of deep concern for our country, our people, and those who serve us in uniform.  The executive order signed by President Trump on Friday has not only sown chaos and created a backlash being felt across the world, it is also endangering our people here at home and our troops overseas.  It bans refugees and is, for all intents and purposes, a ban on Muslims entering our country. It is a religious test. It plays right into the hands of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other extremist groups that mean to do us harm. It arms them. Their message in recruiting and propaganda has been that America is at war with Islam and that when we say we are tolerant and inclusive, it is a lie.  We must not let it be a lie.  Make no mistake, Mr.Speaker, this order will do nothing to make America safer from terrorism. Our enemies will use this Muslim ban to their full advantage, broadcast to all of those who, for whatever reason, may be teetering on the edge of extremism, one image, one tweet, one excuse away from radicalization. And our Muslim allies are scratching their heads in disbelief and disappointment.  CBS News reported this morning, Mr.Speaker, that a senior Iraqi general who commands the elite counterterrorism force trained by the United States military was supposed to come here next week but is now banned from doing so. He told CBS news: ``I am a four-star general. I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning. Now my kids are asking me if I am a terrorist.'' That general, Talib al-Kenani, has been coming here for over a decade meeting with senior U.military leaders at CENTCOM, but now he is banned from entering the country.  This policy is dangerous, counterproductive, and extremely unfortunate.  It is important to note, Mr.Speaker, that of the seven countries included in this ban--hear me, my colleagues--of the seven countries included in this ban, no refugee or immigrant from any of those nations has committed a terrorist act in the United  The President of the United States has a responsibility--a sacred and public trust--to do everything in his power to protect our We have that same responsibility. This Congress has a sacred duty to hold the President accountable and ourselves for doing so in a way that respects our Constitution and our values. That, Mr.Speaker, is patriotism.  So I urge my colleagues on both sides: Stand against this order. Stand up for Stand up for the Stand up for our values. Stand against an act that does nothing but empower our enemies and erode faith in our highest principles in our country and around the world.  The Nation, Mr.Speaker, is watching.  The world, Mr.Speaker, is watching.  I urge us to action.  Representatives Lofgren and Conyers have introduced a bill to block this executive order. I have cosponsored it, along with 160 other Members of this This is a time when party should not be put before country. Party should not be put before patriotism. Party should not be put before principle.  Join me, and let us deny our enemies this potent tool and remind the world what truly makes America great.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH750.txt,566,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,31.0,April

3450,topic-id,1936,"Mr.President, I believe Betsy DeVos is going to be an excellent Secretary of                      Nomination of Jeff Sessions  Mr.President, I have been fortunate enough to get to know Jeff Sessions over the past 20 years. Not only is he a colleague whom I admire and respect, he is also one of my very best friends. I actually suffered through with him back when he had a nomination that was rejected by this body many years ago.  As you know, Senator Sessions has been nominated by the President to be the next Attorney General of the United It is an incredible honor. There is no doubt in my mind that my friend will be perfect for the job. He is more than qualified for this position, and I know he will keep his word when he says he plans to uphold the laws we pass in  Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate in 1997. That was 2 years after I was elected, and we have been very close friends ever since. For 20 years now, we have known each other and worked alongside each other on both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Environment and Public Works Those are the two major committees we have been on. He is seated just to my right in each one of the committees, and, as the Chair knows, you get to know a person pretty well when you have been sitting there for these 3- or 4-hour-long meetings. So we have had that relationship with each other.  Not only have we worked together, but we have also traveled and prayed together. You really get to know someone when you work, travel, and pray together. When working, a person's mind is revealed; when traveling, a person's character is revealed; and when you pray, the person's heart is revealed. I have come to know Senator Sessions as a God-fearing family man who puts others before himself and has a deep respect for the rule of law.  Family man--every time he has a grandchild, his wife and my wife talk about our competing grandchildren.  He helps those in need and makes sure that the legal system is protecting our citizens and holding criminals accountable.  A person only needs to look at the legislation and causes he has championed to know him. He played a key role in fighting for fairness and funding for the rural HIV/AIDS patients when negotiating a reauthorization of the bipartisan Ryan White CARE His advocacy brought funding to low-income, mostly African-American women who did not have easily accessible health care before. Senator Sessions has been an author and supporter of many pieces of bipartisan legislation, including protecting victims of child abuse, reducing prison sentences for those who are unfairly targeted, and helping the families of our fallen military personnel.  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Sessions has become a fierce advocate for keeping our country safe from terrorism, and he understands the risks we face. In fact, Senator Sessions is tough on crime and is well suited to oversee Federal law enforcement activities and to assist local governments in their efforts.  Violent crime has recently been increasing. Furthermore--and I just found this out--the shooting deaths of police officers has increased by 68 percent just in the last year, between 2015 and 2016. That is pretty remarkable. These trends are unacceptable, and Senator Sessions has pledged to reverse the course by strengthening the partnership between Federal and local law enforcement and by going after drug traffickers, aliens who violate the laws, and criminals who use guns to commit crimes.  There is no question that Senator Sessions is qualified to do what he says he will and what the job asks of him. He served as a U.attorney for Alabama's Southern District, and he was also Alabama's attorney general, so he clearly knows the job. He doesn't have to be trained. It is because of his previous experiences that he will be able to transition from a partisan legislator to our Nation's top law enforcement officer with great ease.  Countless groups of people have come out to support the nominee: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, former U.attorneys, a former FBI Director, current[[Page S707]]State attorneys general, and many more. All of the law enforcement professionals are behind him, and there is a reason for it: It is because that is his record, and people are aware of it.  So I would like to take a minute to point out that it is cruel and unfair that people have tried to paint a picture of Senator Sessions as someone and something he is not. I think this is something that needs to be said.  The man the opposition has painted does not exist. You all know Jeff You know that the awful things being said about him are completely false. In fact, back in 1981, the Ku Klux Klan ordered the tragic, extremely undeserved murder of a young African-American man by the name of Michael Because of Senator Sessions's help and support, these Klan members were convicted and given either life sentences or the death penalty. That is Jeff Furthermore, he later played a major role in the destruction of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama when he helped bring a civil suit against them. As a result, the KKK went bankrupt, and he caused them to fall apart in that region. Again, those were Jeff Sessions' efforts.  Before we vote on the confirmation of our friend and colleague, I ask that you all take a moment to seriously reflect how Senator Sessions has worked diligently with you over the past two decades and how perfectly qualified he is for this position.  As for me, I thank him for his tireless efforts in Congress, for his friendship, and for his fellowship. He will go down as one of the truly great U.Attorneys General in this country's history.  Mr.President, there are a lot of other nominees whom I have gotten to know. I had an experience of actually going to Trump Tower and getting to know some of the people who advise him. As I looked around the table, I saw people who were the right kind of people in health care, the right kind of people in energy, and the right kind of people in the military to give him advice in areas he might not have been exposed to in the past.  And I just noticed that it has been very slow. I was not aware of this until a few minutes ago, that apparently the Cabinet confirmations are the slowest since George This is something that is really wrong. You can criticize someone, but after a while, you just go ahead and you know the votes are there, and you make sure that you go ahead and do it.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I would say this to the Presiding Officer, since he and I are both from Oklahoma, which is in the Tenth Circuit: Last week President Trump announced that he was nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to be a U.Supreme Court As someone who had been following the news and rumors of who the pick would be--I had been looking into potential nominees for weeks--I was pleased to see Judge Gorsuch's name come up because we know something about him.  After the untimely death of Justice Scalia a year ago, it was clear that the Presidential election would be about the direction of the Supreme Court for the next generation or maybe even generations. With the results of the election--the Republican President and Republican Congress--the American people have entrusted us to confirm a Supreme Court Justice who will adhere to the rule of law and will not try to read between the lines when interpreting legislation or the With the selection of Judge Gorsuch, I believe President Trump has picked such a The President might not know or remember, but George Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to his current position, and the Senate confirmed him unanimously by voice vote. We went back and looked at the record, and no one voted against him.  There is no question that Judge Gorsuch is qualified for the Supreme He is a graduate of Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and He clerked for Judge Sentelle of the U.court of appeals for the DC He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, so he knows the job. There is no need for on-the-job training for him.  He has been in private practice. He has been a principal deputy to the Associate Attorney General and Acting Attorney General at the U.Department of  Much like the Justice he has been nominated to replace, Judge Gorsuch has become known for his writing style. One of his former law clerks said that his ``favorite aspect of the judge's writing is his ability to humanize disputes.''  It appears that Gorsuch has more in common with the late Justice Scalia than just writing abilities. He has said that ``assiduous focus on text, structure, and history is essential to the proper exercise of the judicial function.'' That judicial philosophy has been borne out in his record on the Tenth  My home State of Oklahoma is within the Tenth Circuit jurisdiction, so we know him very well. Oklahoma is the home of Hobby Everyone is familiar with what Hobby Lobby is. A lot of people don't realize this, but it started out when I was in the State legislature. The Greens, who have Hobby Lobby, started out in their garage. At that time, they were putting together things that they could frame--miniature picture frames and that type of thing. With a loan of $600, David and Barbara Green began making miniature picture frames.  Today, Hobby Lobby is the largest privately owned arts and crafts store in the world, with over 700 stores in all but three They are people of faith, and when they were facing fines under ObamaCare for not providing certain insurance coverage that violated their faith, they were faced with an impossible choice. They took it to court, risking millions of personal dollars in doing so.  In siding with Hobby Lobby against ObamaCare's contraceptive mandate, Judge Gorsuch stressed the point that it is not for a court to decide whether the owners' religious convictions are correct or consistent, but instead the court's role is ``only to protect the exercise of faith,'' and the Supreme Court agreed.  Again, Judge Gorsuch defended the religious beliefs of the Little Sisters of the Poor in his dissent of the Tenth Circuit's refusal to rehear their case against the Obama administration regarding the same mandate that Hobby Lobby was contesting.  Time and again, Judge Gorsuch has defended religious expressions in public space. In addition to defending the First Amendment protections regarding the free exercise of religion, he is also skeptical of the idea that agencies should be given a wide latitude when interpreting statutory language. In a recent opinion, Judge Gorsuch suggested that the precedent of the judiciary to give deference to agencies on statutory interpretations limits the courts when reviewing the legality of agency actions. Gorsuch believes it is for Congress to write the laws, the executive to carry them out, and the judiciary to interpret them, just as our Founding Fathers intended.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move Judge Gorsuch's nomination forward. He is going to be confirmed, and he will make a great Justice of the U.Supreme  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

He testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Keep in mind, when you listen to this--this is a quote from an op-ed piece in the New York Times, and one of the individuals from the administration of President Obama said this: ``His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record that should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.''  That comes from an Obama appointee.  Not only is he well liked, but he also has an impressive resume, serving as law clerk to two different Supreme Court He attended Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and it doesn't get any better than that. It is clear he has the qualifications, and as recently as the last administration, that was really all you needed to be confirmed to be on the U.Supreme  What the Democrats have done to block his nomination has never been done before. This is significant. People don't realize--people who are maybe critical of some of the procedures that were taking place, they forget the fact that there has never been, in the history of America, a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination--there has never been. This will be the first time this happened.  I support the majority leader in changing the rules in the face of this unprecedented action by a minority party. There is really no reason for their filibuster of this highly qualified individual, other than partisanship and catering to their liberal base. Changing the rules for Supreme Court nominations had to be done, and if the situation were reversed, the Democrats would have done the same thing in a heartbeat, as we saw in 2013 when they did the same thing.  Judge Gorsuch deserves to be on the Supreme He does not deserve to be blocked because people are upset that we observed the Biden rule; that is, not providing for any action on a nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy once the election season is underway--and they lost the election.  Now, that is Joe Biden, not Jim Inhofe.[[Page S2404]]  In addition to his impeccable job and experience and educational background, he is perhaps best known for his defense of religious liberty, including a role in the dispute during the Obama administration that required employers to provide abortion-inducing drugs to their employees as part of their health insurance. One of these employers was Hobby  Everyone knows who Hobby Lobby is, but not everyone knew them back when I knew them. I knew them back in the 1970s, when the Green family, who started Hobby Lobby, were actually operating out of their garage, making picture frames, and look at them today. I have known them for a long time. They started out their whole business with a $600 loan. Now they have over 700 stores across the United States and are the largest privately owned arts and crafts store in the world.  Judge Gorsuch and the Supreme Court agreed with Hobby Lobby and upheld their religious liberty rights. I am going to read to my colleagues his concurring opinion. It is very profound. Judge Gorsuch wrote, after they made the determination that Hobby Lobby did not have to give these drugs to their employees:       It is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious      complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a      religious teaching about complicity imposes ``too much''      moral disapproval on those only ``indirectly'' assisting      wrongful conduct. Whether an act of complicity is or isn't      ``too attenuated'' from the underlying wrong is sometimes      itself a matter of faith we must respect the faith.  Now, that is what he wrote in Hobby  In a very similar situation around the same timeframe, there was a case that is known now to be the Little Sisters of the He joined in an opinion defending the rights of nuns not to be forced to pay for abortion-inducing drugs in their healthcare plans. This is another profound statement he made. He said: ``When a law demands that a person do something the person considers sinful, and the penalty for refusal is a large financial penalty, then the law imposes a substantial burden on that person's free exercise of religion.''  It is not just petitioners of the Christian faith whom Judge Gorsuch has sided with. He upheld the religious beliefs of a Native American prisoner and of a Muslim prisoner who found their ability to practice their faith restricted in one manner or another.  He comes to his decision not because he is seeking some predetermined outcome; he comes to his decisions because that is where the facts of the law and the Constitution lead him.  For example, in the Lynch case--another Oklahoma case--Gorsuch referred to Chevron deference as ``a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty.''  Chevron deference is the judicial rule that requires judges to defer to an agency's interpretation--we are talking about a bureaucracy--an agency's interpretation of the law if the law is considered ambiguous or unclear and if the agency's interpretation is reasonable. This defense to the agency gives them a lot of authority, a lot of power. Moreover, it can provide a lot of uncertainty to the regulated community.  As Judge Gorsuch wrote, Chevron deference allows agencies to ``reverse its current view 180 degrees any time based merely on the shift of political winds and still prevail [in court].''  I know a little bit about this. I spent a lot of years being the chairman of a committee called the Environment and Public Works During the Obama years, we had a bureaucracy that was trying to change the law instead of following the law. It was exactly what Judge Gorsuch was talking about in this case when he talked about the Chevron deference, giving deference to a bureaucracy. You can imagine being in business, especially a heavily regulated one, that has to worry that every 4 to 8 years the rules might change then and how do you plan to make your plans.  I think Gorsuch's opinion on Chevron deference is an important debate to have. Do we, as a coequal branch of government, continue to give up our powers to the administrative state or do we take our power back and write laws as they should be implemented? Furthermore, does the judicial branch, as a coequal branch of government, continue to give up their power of interpretation to the administrative state?  These are important, fundamental questions that should be addressed, and I am glad the Gorsuch nomination has brought these cases to light.  Although Judge Gorsuch was nominated by a Republican President, this doesn't mean my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have any concern about Judge Gorsuch's decisionmaking ability. This is important to point out because being a judge is not about making decisions that are in the best interests of any political party but really about making decisions based on facts and the law and the Constitution without bias.  During his confirmation, Judge Gorsuch stated his judicial philosophy, saying:       I decide cases . . . I listen to the arguments made. I read      the briefs that are put to me. I listen to my colleagues      carefully and I listen to the lawyers in the well . . .      keeping an open mind through the entire process as best I      humanly can and I leave all the other stuff at home. And I      make a decision based on the facts and the law.  Who can argue with that? He has proven over a period of time that he will do that.  Through the whole debate, it has become evident that the Democrats were asking him to rule in favor of causes and not to follow the law, which is what a judge does and should do.  Regarding the roles and balance of our government, Gorsuch is what a judge should be. He believes Congress should write the laws, the executive branch is to carry them out, and the judicial branch is to interpret the laws. The confirmation of Judge Gorsuch will shape our Nation for generations to come, and all of us will be able to benefit from his wise decisions.  I am looking forward to confirming Judge Neil It is going to happen tomorrow, and then all of this will be over. I am proud to give him my vote. Justice will be well served as such.

3599,topic-id,826,"Mr.President, I will be brief. I also want to make sure I don't take advantage of the personal privilege I have as a United States Senator, but I am going to anyway.  I want Senator Coons from Delaware to pause for just a second.  I want to thank every Member of the Senate, Republican and Democrat, and the staff of the Senate for the many kindnesses they have extended to me in the last 4 months during my injury and my recovery. I am on the way back home, in large measure, because of the support of the Members of the United States I am very grateful for that and the staff who have allowed that to take place. I say thank you very much.  Notwithstanding what your politics are or what your partisanship is or anything else, this is a great institution and a great body because it is made up of great people.  To that end, my friend Senator Coons from Delaware made an excellent speech, which I am going to adopt as my speech, since I don't have the strength to stand as long as I would like to, to talk about an issue so important. We do need to open all our minds and our hearts in the days ahead to make sure we know what direction we are going as Members of the Senate, regardless of our party and notwithstanding our partisanship.  Neil Gorsuch, from everything I have seen--and I probably have seen more than anybody because I have been watching it on TV while I have been recovering. You guys have had to do it in debate. I have seen the real thing.  His record, his testimony, the way he presented himself, the way Senator Grassley and Senator Feinstein allowed that hearing to go forth, I know we have a good man as a nominee to be a Supreme Court Justice of the United States, but the issues and the divide on the cloture, on a simple majority, and the rule change of 2013, and what has happened in the past, now has us in a position where we slowly but surely are moving to be a body that is another House of Representatives, not the United States  The majority rule is a great philosophy. The majority winning is always a great philosophy, but I used to have a teacher who taught me. She said: If four equals the majority, three equals zero, but you always need to listen to the other three because sometimes they may be right. I think that is a good lesson for us today, and that was a grammar school teacher.  If there are seven voting members, four does equal the majority, but three doesn't equal zero because the rest still count.  As we move forward in the days ahead and judge other issues, whether they be partisan issues in terms of regular debate and general legislation, whether it be issues over the confirmation of judges or Secretaries or whatever it may be, let's be thoughtful, so that, not as a criticism of the House, but as a compliment to our Founding Fathers, we don't become a second House and later a unicameral body, majority rule and mob rule, and eventually waive rules, where passions overrule common sense and all of a sudden you find yourself digging your way out of a hole that you have created, rather than building the dreams you have always wanted to do.  I commend the leadership of both parties for exercising their political and partisan desires. I commend each Member for being here to take part in this debate today and being a part of it. That is what America is all about.  Somewhere down the line, there is going to be something that is going to happen that is going to cause a resurrection of the debate that we have had today and another road to cross on which way we go in the future. The more we move away from a Senate that is a deliberative body, that is a dignified body, to a body that makes sure it knows where it is going before it moves forward, we won't be better off. If we move toward a body that is a rubberstamp of the House or a unicameral government of legislation, we will never be the United States of America our Founding Fathers intended us to be. That is what I believe, and that is what I think the end of this will be.  To all our Members, I compliment them on everything they have had to say and have done.  Judge Gorsuch, I am so proud to have someone like that who will hopefully serve on the bench of the U.Supreme Court with distinction.  To all of us, our job is not finished.

3684,topic-id,674,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to TrumpCare, the Republican plan to privatize Medicare, penalize working families, and prioritize the wealthy.  The Republican majority is in denial about the tremendous gains of the Affordable Care Act in covering tens of millions of people across this  In my home State of Washington, Mr.Speaker, because of the Affordable Care Act, the average annual premium increases have dropped from 18.5 percent, before the passage of the ACA, to 6.7 percent in 2017. The growth of individual enrollment reached nearly 320,000 people in 2015; and with Medicaid expansion in Washington State, the decline in the uninsured plummeted to 7 percent in 2015, from over 13 percent in 2009. 605,000 Washingtonians also gained coverage through Medicaid expansion.  All of these gains, Mr.Speaker, are in jeopardy as TrumpCare threatens to strip 20 million people, many of whom voted for Mr.Trump, of their health care. Across the Nation, older Americans will be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what others will pay for health care.  Four hundred of the wealthiest families in America will be handed a tax break worth $7 million a year, all on the backs of working families. According to the Tax Policy Center, under TrumpCare, the top 0.1 percent of earners would receive an average tax cut of $197,000, while older Americans would face increases of almost $7,000 each.  Under TrumpCare, many employers will stop providing coverage, letting their employees fend for themselves with a tax credit. Compared to the subsidies that Americans have today, the tax credits will end up being a tax hike.  Not only does TrumpCare impose radical new restrictions on a woman's right to comprehensive health coverage, it defunds Planned Parenthood, robbing women with nowhere else to turn of essential preventative care and affordable contraceptives.  Mr.Speaker, these are sad, sad facts. But the stories from hundreds of my constituents are even more heartbreaking. Lynn told me:       If I were to get a bad illness, it would kill me      financially. And the stress alone from having my health      insurance taken is causing me health problems already.  Luke wrote to tell me that when his wife needed emergency gall bladder surgery while he was a student, the bills would have been crushing. He said:       Without the ACA, we would have been saddled with nearly      $40,000 in hospital bills, ER, one surgery, and one overnight      stay.  Kristy shared:       Without contraceptive care that is covered in the ACA, I      would never be able to afford my I might have an      unwanted pregnancy, and I wouldn't be able to afford another      child. This means so much to me as a woman, a mother, and as      a human. I am able to have power to make decisions about my      family, and this means the world to me.  The lessons and stories like this, Mr.Speaker, are what we should be incorporating into our legislative deliberations, not cynical attempts to penalize people for wanting to have basic health insurance coverage for themselves and their families.  What is worse, the Republican majority seems intent on obscuring the real cost of this misguided proposal. Mr.Speaker, the majority deserves this They are cut from the same cloth and relying on the power of obfuscating the truth.  Since President Trump is not being forced to be transparent about his taxes or his financial entanglements with foreign interests like Russia, the Republican majority doesn't think that they need to ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to offer the true picture of how many people will be hurt by their bill and how much it will cost the American people. This is simply no way to govern.  At the most fundamental level, health care is a human right and not a luxury, as our Republican colleagues would have us believe; a healthy population is a healthy workforce; a healthy workforce is a healthy economy; and a healthy economy is a healthy nation.  TrumpCare puts all Americans at risk. Let's work together to protect and expand our health care and put this mess behind us.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1952-2.txt,99999999999999,AUTHORIZING THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO AMEND THE DEFINITE PLAN,2017.0,9.0,April

3609,topic-id,1327,"Mr.President, Senator Graham, my fellow Senators, our constituents in the Gallery, a lot of what has gone on today may seem very complicated. We have heard a lot of terms being thrown around: cloture, the nuclear option. Yet, really, the question that we were faced with today in the Senate was very simple, and it continues to be pretty simple and straightforward, in my judgment: Should we have an up-or-down vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Court?  Earlier today, the Senate voted to do that. I think it is very important for the American judicial system and for the American system of democracy that the U.Senate be allowed to vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the U.Supreme It was not enough to only vote on a motion to end debate; we also needed to be allowed to vote on the actual nomination with ``yes'' or ``no.''  Unfortunately, our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle decided to filibuster in order to make it impossible for us to vote on this crucial nominee without modifying the rules of the U.That is what we did earlier today. I do not know that anybody did it happily, but certainly a majority of the Senate believed that the American people deserved an up-or-down vote, yea or nay. Stand up and be counted in front of God and country. Do you want Judge Neil Gorsuch to be on the Supreme Court, or do you not? That vote is going to take place tomorrow afternoon.  The Constitution reads that the President of the United States of America ``shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme Court.'' I do not need to tell you that this is an extremely important part of our separation of powers. It is vital to our protecting the integrity of the Supreme Court, the work that all of us do--not just members of the Judiciary Committee but every Member of the Senate--in vetting our nominees and making sure they are qualified and independent, as is Neil He is enormously important for the protection of liberty itself.  Let's not ever forget what we are protecting. We are protecting justice, and we are protecting liberty. We are not supposed to be protecting a certain point of view. We are not supposed to be protecting a certain policy preference. We are not supposed to be protecting a certain political party.  I hope tomorrow, when we finally get the opportunity to vote up or down on Neil Gorsuch for his membership on the greatest tribunal in the history of civilization, in my judgment, the U.Supreme Court, that we will consider his nomination in light of how it will affect our country, not our party. When we look at his nomination from that perspective and leave the politics of the last few years in the rearview mirror, I think we can analyze his nomination with a lot more clarity.  Alexander Hamilton, whom I think most Americans admire, said in Federalist 78 that the Court has ``neither force nor will but merely judgment.'' I think that is what we are all looking for--or should be--in a nominee to any court but especially to the[[Page S2403]]U.Supreme We are not looking for somebody with a certain policy preference. We are not looking for people with ideas of how the law can be improved because the role of a judge is not to make law, it is to interpret the law as made by the legislative body as best that judge can understand it. That is why we need someone like Neil Gorsuch, in my estimation, who has good judgment.  I sit on the Judiciary I have spent 20 to 40 hours with Neil Gorsuch or with people who know him well, in hearing their testimony. I have read his opinions. As far as I am concerned, he is as good as it gets. I cannot imagine that President Trump could have picked better.  He is a thoroughbred. He is a legal rock star. If you read his opinions, you will see that he is painstaking in his application of the law to the facts before him. He writes beautifully. His communication skills are absolutely amazing. His analysis and analytical rigor are clear and concise. His decisions are wise and disciplined, and he is faithful to the law. He is an intellectual, not an ideologue. He is a judge, not a politician. He is whip-smart, has clear writing, is a strict constitutionalist, likes snow skiing, fly fishing, and is a fourth-generation I think he will serve every person in our country well as a member of the Supreme That is why I am supporting him.  Let me say one final thing. I do not think there is any vote that will be more important than the vote we will take tomorrow on a President's nomination to the U.Supreme Court, so I want to choose my words carefully. Not a single, solitary vote is more important than that vote we will take tomorrow. That is not to say that there are not other important issues before this body. That is why I think it was so important today that we decided to vote up or down on Judge Gorsuch so that we can move on to those other important issues--jobs, jobs, jobs; designing a healthcare delivery system that looks like somebody designed it on purpose, which our Acting President has worked so hard on; infrastructure; elementary and secondary education; a skilled workforce. I could go on.  There is an enormous amount of pain in America today. There are too many Americans who are not participating in the great wealth of America--not economically, not socially, not culturally, and not spiritually. We have been elected in the Congress to do something about that.  I talk to people in my State every day, and I know the Presiding Officer does too. The people of Louisiana are fun-loving, God-fearing, and plain-talking, and this is what they tell me: Kennedy, this country was founded by geniuses, but sometimes I think it is being run by idiots.  They say: Kennedy, we look around our country today, and here is what we see. We see too many undeserving people at the top--I want to emphasize ``undeserving'' because I don't want to paint with too broad a brush--who are getting bailouts, and we see too many undeserving people at the bottom who are getting handouts. We are in the middle, and we get stuck with the bill. We cannot pay it anymore, Kennedy, because our health insurance has gone up, our kids' tuitions have gone up, and our taxes have gone up. I will tell you what has not gone up--our income.  These are real people with real problems, and they sent all of us here because they are real mad and they expect us to do something about it.  The sad truth is that our children's generation is at risk of becoming the first in America, unless this body does something, to be worse off than their parents' generation because in our country today, for too many Americans, it is harder than ever to get ahead. That is why so many Americans feel stuck. They feel like the hope and change they were promised has become decline and uncertainty, and they are looking to us to do something about it.  So let's vote. Let's vote tomorrow. I understand reasonable people disagree. I understand unreasonable people can disagree too. But I am going to vote for Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Then I am going to ask this body to move on to other important issues that are keeping moms and dads awake at night when they lie down and try to go to sleep.

Mr.Speaker, this bill is an important step toward modernizing the Federal Communications The FCC has served Americans since 1934, and over the past more than 80 years, this agency has been responsible for overseeing the evolving telecommunications sector, with collecting information and analyzing the state of competition, and the impact of these changes on consumers.  As society has moved from one technology to the next, the FCC has been asked to keep up with the changing technologies, and Congress has directed the Commission with reviewing data and reporting on everything from the telegraph, as Mr.Scalise has indicated, and the AM radio to online video distributions like Hulu and This bill will eliminate reports that are no longer necessary and waste time and resources on issues that are no longer critical to consumers.  The bill also recognizes that technology continues to progress and consumers are no longer served by separate voice, data, or video networks. Rather, providers are leveraging the same IP network to provide multiple services over the same network. Providers that were solely video providers now offer voice and data. Companies that thought of themselves as telephone providers are also offering video and broadband services. The game has changed, and we believe that the FCC should change its reporting to reflect the new reality.  This bill consolidates multiple annual or biennial reports that require the agency to evaluate competition in different sectors. We will no longer require a separate mobile wireless or a separate video competition report. Rather, the bill requires the Commission to evaluate the state of competition across multiple tech industries in a single biennial report on competition in the communications marketplace. Our policymakers should be looking at the world as it is, not the world that once existed.  I thank the majority whip for his leadership in sponsoring this bill. He has always shown a keen interest in modernizing the communications marketplace, and I welcome his continued engagement over the 115th Congress, where he serves with such distinction as our whip.

3641,topic-id,1982,"Mr.President, I have listened over the last several weeks to accusations and a type of smear campaign, quite frankly, of a good judge and a good man: Neil  It is remarkable to me to see that the debate has become more about character destruction than it has been about policy differences. I understand there are policy differences, but why does it have to come to this?  In the past few weeks, I have heard on this floor that Neil Gorsuch shouldn't be a Justice on the Supreme Court because he has no independence from President  2, I have heard he was handpicked by far right groups like the Federalist Society, a group of legal minds committed to the original interpretation of the Constitution--clearly, a scandalous group of radicals.  I have heard that Judge Gorsuch supports torture, he is against privacy, he hates truckers, he will step on the little guy, he will help only big corporations, he is just not mainstream, and I have heard that he shouldn't be selected because he was not approved first by the Democratic Senate leadership.[[Page S2413]]  All of these reasons have been given for a historic change in Senate tradition not to give a Supreme Court Justice an up-or-down vote. Block him on a procedural motion; for the first time ever, block a Supreme Court Justice on a procedural motion with a partisan vote.  Let me take these one at a time as I walk through this.  1, I heard constantly that he is not independent enough from President As far as I know, he had never even met President Trump before. This didn't seem to be a standard, to be independent from the current sitting  Let me give an example: Justice Elena Kagan, who is clearly qualified as a legal mind, but I would say Republicans have serious policy differences with her. Justice Kagan was allowed to have an up-or-down vote. This body did not have a standard that they had to be independent from the If they had a standard like that, Justice Kagan would have never been on the bench. Why do I say that?  On May 10, 2010, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme From 1997 to 1999, she served as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and was Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council for President In 2009, she was confirmed Solicitor General of the United States for President She worked for President Obama in the Obama White House as his Solicitor General and then was taken directly out of the White House and put on the Supreme  I would say that is not independent from the So this mythological new standard that any Court Justice nominee needs to be independent from the President clearly wasn't in place when Elena Kagan was being heard.  It is also interesting to me that one of the most talked about decisions from Judge Gorsuch was a Chevron decision that he put out. The whole crux of that decision was the independence of the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. Let me just read a few paragraphs from the decision he wrote. He wrote this:       For whatever the agency may be doing under Chevron, the      problem remains that courts are not fulfilling their duty to      interpret the law and declare invalid agency actions      inconsistent with those interpretations in the cases and      controversies that come before them. A duty expressly      assigned to them by the APA [Administrative Procedures Act]      and one often likely compelled by the Constitution itself.      That's a problem for the judiciary. And it is a problem for      the people whose liberties may now be impaired not by an      independent decisionmaker seeking to declare the law's      meaning as fairly as possible--the decisionmaker promised to      them by law--but by an avowedly politicized administrative      agent seeking to pursue whatever policy whim may rule the      day. Those problems remain uncured by this line of reply.  In other words, the judiciary needs to have oversight of the executive agency in what they put out as far as agency rulings, not allowing the White House or any agency to just make any decision they like. He continued writing:       Maybe as troubling, this line of reply invites a nest of      questions even taken on its own terms. Chevron says that we      should infer from any statutory ambiguity Congress's      ``intent'' to ``delegate'' its ``legislative authority'' to      the executive to make ``reasonable'' policy choices. But      where exactly has Congress expressed this intent? Trying to      infer the intentions of an institution composed of 535      members is a notoriously doubtful business.  In all the accusations that he is not independent of the President, in one of his most famous opinions, he declares that we absolutely need to have independence from the White House--of any White House--and have a clear separation of powers between judiciary, legislative, and executive. That actually does not stand up to simple muster. So the first thing falls: no independence from the  The second issue which came up often was that he was handpicked by far-right groups. There were all these groups that handpicked him, so somehow that made it horrible that these different groups would actually try to support him.  I go back to Justice Again, that wasn't the standard at that time, and I could use numerous judges through that process. Elena Kagan was supported by the AFL-CIO, by the Human Rights Campaign, by numerous environmental groups like WildEarth Guardians, Sierra Club, and the National Organization for She had a lot of different liberal or progressive groups that were very outspoken in support of and helping to push her nomination.  There is nothing wrong with that. She was a nominee who was actively engaged in White House politics; she was actively engaged in Democratic campaigns. Before that, as far as working for the Dukakis campaign, she was a Democratic activist, and it was well known. That did not preclude her from getting an up-or-down vote for the Supreme Court because she is sitting on the Supreme Court today. There was no cloture vote mandate or requirement for a 60-vote threshold as there was pushed by this minority.  This issue that somehow you can't be handpicked or that having some groups that would support you from the outside somehow precludes you from being a serious consideration is not legitimate, and everyone knows it.  I have also heard individuals out there saying that he is for torture, he is against privacy, he hates truckers, he will step on the little guy, he is only for big corporations, and he is not mainstream.  Here is the problem: When you actually look at the history, it is very different from that. Of the 2,700 cases that Judge Gorsuch has been involved in, in the 10\1/2\ years he has been on the Tenth Circuit, he has been overturned in his opinions once--once in 2,700 cases; 97 percent of the time his cases were settled unanimously, and 99 percent of the time he voted with the majority.  Lest you don't know the Tenth Circuit as we know the Tenth Circuit in Oklahoma, because it is the circuit court for our State, the majority of the judges on the Tenth Circuit are judges selected by President Carter, President Clinton, and President They hold the majority in the Tenth So to say that he voted with them in the majority 99 percent of the time would be to say that the Carter, Clinton, and Obama appointees also apparently had these radical ideas. It is just not consistent with the facts.  Then I have heard of late that the President should have engaged with Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle to be asked for their approval of the nominee before that nominee was ever brought. Well, I don't know if that has ever been a requirement. There have been times that Presidents in the past have had conversations with people on both side of the aisle. Fine, but it is certainly not a requirement of the Constitution, and it certainly doesn't preclude a nomination.  It is interesting to me that Judge Gorsuch offered to meet with 100 Senators one-on-one, face-to-face. Only 80 of them accepted his offer; 20 of them refused to even meet with him face-to-face. He did 4 days of hearings in the Judiciary Committee, 4 solid, long days, where he answered every possible question he could answer.  He has had extensive background checks. Everyone has gone through every piece of everything they could find that has ever been written. In fact, the latest new accusation is they found a couple of places where what he wrote seemed to look strangely like something else someone else wrote--which, when I saw it and read the side-by-side on it, I thought: He forgot to do an annotation and a footnote in the 800 opinions he has written. In the tens of thousands of annotations that he did, he didn't do a couple of them. Somehow that doesn't seem to rise to the level that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court--that in the tens of thousands of annotations he put there, he might have missed a couple.  I would challenge anyone serving in this body, to say: You can serve only if you have never missed a single footnote on any paper you ever wrote. I would say: Those who live in glass houses probably shouldn't throw stones because we have all had times like that.  He is a solid jurist. I believe he will do a good job. In the time I sat down in his office, we looked at each other face-to-face, and I went through multitudes of hard questions with him, trying to determine his judicial philosophy, seeking one simple thing: Will you interpret the law as the law--not with personal opinion but as the law.  This body is about opinions. This body is about listening to the voices all across our States and trying to make[[Page S2414]]good policy. Across the street at the Supreme Court, it is about one thing: What does the law say and what did it mean when it was written?  The Constitution and law were not living documents. They do live in the sense that if you want to make changes in the Constitution, you amend the Constitution and you make changes to it. You can't suddenly say it meant one thing one day but culture has changed and now it means something new.  If you need new law, this body passes new law. Across the street, they read the law and ask: What does it mean? It is that straightforward.  I look forward to having a jurist on the Supreme Court as an Associate Justice who says: I may not even like all my opinions and you may not like all my opinions, but I am going to follow the law, and what the law says is what we are going to do.  I think that is the best we can ask from a Supreme Court Justice, and I think it is a fair way to be able to get him an up-or-down vote. I have to tell you, I am profoundly disappointed that the Senate, to get a simple up-or-down vote, had to go through all of this just to be able to do what we have always done.

3443,topic-id,769,"Mr.President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from[[Page S694]]Minnesota for her comments. She speaks from experience and knowledge, as has the senior Senator from Washington State, on this issue.  In my years here, I have seen thousands of confirmation votes, literally at all levels, up to and including Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices. I have voted for a large majority of a President's nominations--both Republican and Democratic Some may not have been those I would have chosen, but I felt that, at least, the President should be given the prerogative, if the person is qualified.  Now, ideology is one thing, and qualification is another. Out of those thousands of confirmation votes, I have a hard time remembering any that were like this one. This one had a whirlwind confirmation hearing and committee vote. It was almost as though they were afraid to have the nominee actually have to appear and answer questions. And now the Senate is going to vote on the nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of  I will be very blunt. On the very little time that she was allowed to be shown to the public, she showed--and I certainly believe this--that she does not have the qualifications to uphold the Department of Education's primary goal--that of ensuring that all students--all students, not just the wealthy, but all students--have access to a quality, public education that allows them to succeed.  I am both a father and a grandfather, and I am proud of it. I watched my children go to school. And now I see my grandchildren going to school. I understand well the impact of education on our children. When students have access to strong public education from the very beginning, they are more apt to succeed in the long run.  Our Nation's public schools--as is the case in my home State of Vermont--hold the promise of student success through strong State accountability measures and legal protections regardless of one's race, income, or learning ability. They offer nutritious meals for underserved students, many of whom receive their only meals of the day at school. Any teacher will tell you that if you have a hungry child, you have a child who cannot learn. If a child is fed, you have a child who can learn.  Public education means strong teachers and school leaders, technology in the classroom, an assessment to test not just how well a student can memorize material for an exam on a particular day of the year, but how much they have grown over the course of many months.  Many of the schools have counselors and nurses. They operate under a modern infrastructure to support those with disabilities and children in foster care. But public education also means that both the States and the Federal Government are held accountable for everyone having access to the same excellent resources.  In fact, just over 1 year ago, this body agreed to these protections. We passed the Every Student Succeeds Act here in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 12--an amazing, overwhelming, bipartisan vote. It was the firm agreement among the majority of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--that all students deserve access to critical public school resources in order to succeed. We made a promise that we would do better by our students; that public schools would be the premier standard for outstanding education for all.  Unfortunately, the nominee before us--in the very little time that she was allowed to testify and be questioned in the confirmation hearing--showed that she does not share these same goals. Instead, she has referred to public schools as a ``dead end.''  Well, if you are a billionaire, you have a choice to go wherever you want to school. Maybe these people in a public school are not good enough for you? Well, then, go buy a school if you want. Most people don't have that option. Most people are hard working. My wife and I were when our kids were in school. Our children are today.  What does Betsy DeVos advocate for? She advocates for the privatization of education. She has funneled millions of dollars into organizations and initiatives to promote private school vouchers and school choice.  These efforts have diverted public funds toward private schools, schools that are not held to any antidiscrimination or accountability standards. These schools can discriminate all they want.  At her confirmation hearing--in the very little time that she did speak--she did not understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education This is a landmark law. It is a Federal law that public schools in all 50 States must follow.  Lastly, ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS685-7.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,6.0,February

Affordable housing should not be a political issue; it is a moral issue.

I am disappointed that President Trump did not look to our knowledgeable housing advocates across the country to identify a qualified, experienced nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and instead nominated Ben Carson to this important position. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Dr, Carson, like many nominees, said the right things. He made the right promises. I want to believe that he will fulfill those commitments.

I am proud of the progress we have made in Vermont and across the Nation through programs implemented by the Department of Housing and Urban During his confirmation hearing, Carson testified to the crucial role of rental assistance programs.

3758,topic-id,753,"Madam President, Trump's Executive order banning Muslims from seven countries, none of which was a source of terrorists who have carried out attacks in this country, was un-American, arbitrary, inhumane, and it will likely spur an increase in violence targeting I will have plenty more to say about it and other reckless actions by this White House in the days and weeks ahead.  In the meantime, I want to say a few words about the bizarre back and forth between the Trump administration and the news media regarding attendance at the inauguration and who is telling the truth and who is not.  One might think that with all that is happening in the country and the world and the rush by the President to sign Executive orders that would dramatically affect the rights, and the priorities, of millions of Americans, the question of how many people were at the inauguration would not generate such controversy. But it turns out that this is about much more than that, as it goes to the heart of the role of a free press in this country and whether the American people can have confidence that the President is telling the truth.  We already knew that candidate and now President Trump is prone to bragging and making wildly unrealistic promises and inaccurate claims, many of which he later disavows. He frequently ignores or misstates basic facts and refuses to correct those falsehoods. So it was no surprise when he predicted that the crowd at his inauguration would be ``an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.''  It was also no surprise, as usually happens at inaugurations and large public demonstrations, that high-elevation photographs were used to estimate the number of participants. To anyone who attended both the Obama and Trump inaugurations, it was obvious that the number of people at President Obama's inauguration was far larger than at President Trump's inauguration, as photographs clearly showed.  President Trump, however, insisted the photographs were fabricated. The morning after the inauguration, he said he could see from the stage on the West Front of the Capitol that there were ``a million'' or ``a million and a half'' people on the  When reports clearly showed only a fraction of that, he accused news organizations of lying, calling them ``among the most dishonest human beings on Earth,'' and warned that they would regret it.  Later that day, the President's spokesman, Sean Spicer, also accused the press of lying. He said the photographs were deceptive, and he insisted that President Trump's inauguration was ``the most watched ever.'' That, of course, was a clever distortion of what the President actually said.[[Page S467]]  President Trump was unmistakably talking about the number of people who were actually present on the Mall when he was sworn in, which seems to matter more to him than it does to anyone else.  Mr.Spicer expanded that number by an indeterminable amount to include anyone who had watched anywhere in the world on a cell phone, television, or other electronic device.  A day later, Mr.Spicer berated the press for being unfair by reporting on this. Perhaps he had forgotten that it was President Trump who initiated the whole thing by publicly promising something that did not happen and then falsely accusing the press of lying, as did Mr.Spicer, after being proven wrong.  Mr.Spicer also may have forgotten that, shortly after President Obama was inaugurated, the Senate majority leader announced that the Republicans' 1 priority was to prevent him from being elected to a second term. Failing that, they spent 8 years trying to obstruct, sabotage, and discredit everything President Obama tried to do.  During much of that time, Donald Trump carried on an utterly false campaign accusing President Obama of lying about his birthplace.  Two days later and without citing any evidence--because no evidence exists--President Trump resurrected his false claim that that he lost the popular vote because 3 to 5 million ``illegal immigrants'' voted. Mr.Spicer echoed this same claim, citing unnamed ``studies.''  This, of course, is patently false and absurd, but one can assume that it will be repeated by Republicans to justify more onerous, discriminatory voter suppression voting requirements which have been a crusade of theirs, particularly in areas with large minority populations that traditionally vote  To add insult to injury, Kellyanne Conway, the President's counselor, announced that President Trump will not be releasing his tax returns.

Our goal in Malden--our goal in Massachusetts--is to be 1. 1, not just in the United States but 1 in the world. We know you can do it if you make a commitment to these kids.  It is not just our traditional public schools. It is our public charter schools, our private schools, our preparatory schools that are enormously successful. Many of them are world famous, these high schools. People send their children from around the country to go to a school in  The success of our public charter schools is largely due to very strong accountability measures brought about through State regulations and rigorous oversight. That is the key to our charter school system. It is accountability. It is oversight. It should not be draining money out of the charter school system for profits for private corporations. It has to be invested in the kids, but Betsy DeVos wants charter schools to have less accountability and has fought to keep charter schools unregulated across  When the Michigan State Legislature introduced a bipartisan bill that would have expanded oversight of charter schools, Betsy DeVos stepped in. She and her family donated $1.45 million to State legislators in order to strip the helpful oversight accountability language out of the bill. That works out to $25,000 a day over the 7-week period the bill was being debated. Betsy DeVos and her unlimited funding ultimately succeeded in blocking the commonsense accountability legislation. The students and families of Detroit were denied the key protections in oversight that their schools needed.  Betsy DeVos's school choice priorities go beyond expanding and deregulating charter schools. She has pushed for voucher programs that would use taxpayer money, your money, to pay for a child's private school tuition. Under a national voucher system, the funding that would normally go to local school districts would instead be diverted away from public schools toward for-profit, private institutions. In addition to the private schools that benefit from a voucher system, 80 percent of the charter schools in Michigan are run by for-profit companies, a much higher percentage than any other These companies are focused first and foremost on making money. We don't allow this to happen in We have only one goal, and that is to be 1.  That money must stay in the school system, especially if you are trying to educate a minority population, which is the future workforce of our country. That is key. They don't come from the traditional backgrounds in many circumstances. The Secretary of Education must fight for all children and families, not promote companies seeking to profit off the backs of our students. Not even Michigan--the State where DeVos and her family money have tried to exert the most influence over education policy--has implemented a statewide voucher system. Despite spending $5.6 million on a campaign to promote school vouchers, the DeVos family failed to amend the Michigan State constitution. If Betsy DeVos is allowed to expand her school choice policies across the United States, it would be devastating for our students and for the future of our country. Her ideas are too extreme. They will not work for our students or for school districts in our  I also share serious doubts that Betsy DeVos will support all students in The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is the primary Federal law that ensures that all students in every State have access to a free and appropriate public education, regardless of physical or mental handicaps, learning or attention disorders. This law covers students who are blind, deaf, vocally or mobility impaired, and those with autism or Congress passed the original form of IDEA in 1975. It is a bedrock law in our country. Yet when Betsy DeVos was asked about it during her nomination hearing before the HELP Committee, she stated that States should be responsible for determining how, and even if, to enforce  Remember, IDEA goes right to the heart of what we are going to do for those kids with disabilities. That is a bedrock law in our States must abide by it. We need a Secretary of Education who understands longstanding Federal education law and will commit to protecting every student in America because every student deserves the guarantee that they can and they will receive a free and appropriate public education that is promised and protected by law.  If this laundry list of efforts to undermine public education wasn't enough to cause skepticism about Betsy DeVos's qualifications to be Secretary of Education, in her confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos would not commit to keeping guns out of our schools. Her response when asked about the issue was: ``I think that is best left to locals and States to decide.'' Guns do not belong anywhere near our schools or our students and teachers, not in public or private schools, not in elementary schools, and[[Page S714]]not in our high schools. I am proud to have stood with Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal on the floor of the Senate for 15 hours calling for congressional action on commonsense gun safety legislation. As a Senator, the safety and security of Massachusetts' schools, neighborhoods, and communities are my top priority.  Our Secretary of Education has the safety of every student in every State in his or her hands, and I do not believe Betsy DeVos is up to that job. I do not stand alone in this conclusion that Betsy DeVos is unfit to be Secretary of I received tens of thousands of letters and phone calls from constituents all across Massachusetts urging me to reject her nomination. These come from teachers and administrators, the people who work on these issues every day. I have a letter here from Todd Simendinger, the principal of Rockport Elementary School in Rockport,  He wrote to me last week and said:       Senator Markey, as a strong supporter of public education,      I ask that you oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as      Secretary of We must have a secretary who can      commit to supporting every student in all public schools and      provide leadership that will help our neighborhood schools      succeed. Betsy DeVos's record in education and her      performance at the recent confirmation hearing prove that she      is the wrong candidate for the job. As a principal, I have      spoken with teachers, parents, students, and community      members who agree that America's future depends on a strong      investment in our Nation's public schools.  The offices of so many of my colleagues who have spoken on the floor already have, like me, received these kinds of letters and messages literally on a minute-by-minute basis from our constituents. Their passion is born of a deep commitment to ensuring that the very best education for all of the children of the Commonwealth can only be provided if the standard for that education is high. I commend them, and I agree with their concerns. All children deserve that standard.  So, from my perspective, you cannot have a more fundamental issue before us, this privatization of the public school system in America, the voucherization of our public school system in There is a model. It is We do it right now. We are 1 in the country. We look over our shoulders at those who are behind us. But it is a standard that basically says: We are going to invest in the public schools and the charter schools. We are going to make sure they have the highest possible standards.  That is a recipe for ensuring that every child, regardless of their national nationality or their income, gets the education they need for a portable passport to a global economy for the rest of their lives. That has to be our goal. What is happening using the philosophy of Betsy DeVos is a failure. It is a proven failure. We already see the results. What is happening in Massachusetts, what happens in implementing the standards of the laws that we already have on the books across our country--it points us in the correct direction.

It was plenty because my parents knew that living in America gave their children access to a free public education, and they always taught us that an education was the key toward a better life.  Growing up, I was a quiet kid. I was very studious. I got good grades, but I struggled with public speaking. I know some of my colleagues wouldn't believe that today, but it is true.  Unfortunately for me, one of the final requirements before I graduated high school was a public speech class. Again, I did all the work, but I refused to actually stand up in front of the class and speak. I thought I could get away with it, but my teacher, Gail Harper, had other ideas.  She kept me after class. After my classmates left, she forced me to recite short stories and poetry and speeches I had written that were part of the classwork. Eventually she told me that I was going to be the narrator in a school production, which meant that I was going to be speaking on stage in front of the entire student body. I was[[Page S715]]petrified--petrified. And I was inclined to refuse.  I am not sure if there would have been a more terrifying thought to me in the world than having to get up in front of my entire student body, but ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS685-7.txt,791,SECURING ACCESS TO NETWORKS IN DISASTERS ACT,2017.0,6.0,January
3661,topic-id,1409,"Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his efforts to see that this legislation gets passed. I am pleased to see that we have been joined in a unanimous way by the Senate, Republicans and Democrats working together to see that our veterans receive better care.  In addition to the Senator from Montana, I thank Mr.McCain, the Senator from Arizona, who is joining us on the floor. I also thank Senator Isakson in particular, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, for his leadership in seeing that we are here today to bring this legislation across the finish line.  The House passed legislation similar to this, so this is an opportunity for us to get an accomplishment--not for a pat on our backs but for the improvement in the care of those who served[[Page S2164]]our I asked this question on the Senate floor before: Of all the people in the United States, who would you expect to get the best care possible? While we want every American to have high-quality care and access to medical treatment, we certainly want to make certain those who served our country and to whom a commitment was made that they would receive care--we want that commitment fulfilled, and we want it done in a way that is advantageous and easy for our veterans.  The Senator from Montana is correct. The Choice Act is a significant improvement, in my mind, for accessing care. Kansas is not quite as large as the State of Montana, but we are a large rural State, and it is a long distance to a VA hospital. So Choice was brought into play to try to alleviate the backlog, the lack of providers within the VA, and the wait times that veterans faced, but also to try to satisfy the needs of veterans who live long distances from a VA facility.  So Choice is in place, but it still has been a difficult time for many veterans across the country and certainly at home. It is the most common conversation I have when I am back in In fact, I had a townhall meeting in southwest Kansas, in Dodge City, and it is veterans who, in the public forum, will tell me about the problems with the VA and particularly with Choice, or they will line up after or before that meeting to tell me in person that they need help.  This legislation does three significant things. More is to come. We need a permanent act. This is an extension of the Choice Act that expires on August 7, so continuing the program is the first step while we work out the desired outcome of a long-term permanent program.  Secondly, it provides the money through that period of time. It allows the expenditure of dollars to pay for  Third, it eliminates the intermediary--somebody separate from the VA in paying the bills--and that reduces the bureaucracy and burden on our veterans.  I was just looking through what we call casework, things Kansans bring to our office to try to get solved. Front and center is the number of veterans who are being harassed by collection agencies for bills they thought would be paid by the VA through the Choice Program, and they are not being paid in a timely fashion. This eliminates the intermediary--the manager of the program--from paying the bills and restores that authority to the VA to write out the checks with the goal of reducing the bureaucracy and paperwork for the veterans. It also increases the timeliness for the payment that is due the healthcare provider--the doctor, the pharmacy, and the hospital.  Again, as a rural American, many of our providers are struggling. Hospital doors are a challenge to remain open in rural communities across my And that long wait for a reimbursement check for services provided months ago also creates a burden on that hospital, that healthcare provider. So timely payment certainly will benefit the veterans, but it also increases the chances of the stability of healthcare providers in rural communities across my State and around the country.  Finally, it increases the ability for the sharing of medical records between the VA and that community healthcare provider.  Choice is in place to help those veterans who need to have care more quickly and who need to have care closer to home. This bill improves that program and extends it, and that is a significant development. I appreciate the opportunity I have had to work with the Senators from Arizona, Montana, and Georgia to make sure we got to the point we are today. I appreciate my colleagues' unanimous support for the passage of this legislation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from Kansas for all the hard work he has done, and the Senator from On the rare occasion I come to praise him, I would like to give him my deep and heartfelt appreciation for his work in a bipartisan fashion on this issue. I mean that with all sincerity. I also thank our distinguished chairman, Senator I also think I share with my colleagues an appreciation for Shulkin, the new Secretary of the Veterans' Administration, who has been an active and helpful participant in this effort.  Most everything has been said except that I would like to remind my colleagues that we now have--since the enactment in 2014, over 7 million appointments have been made using the Choice Now, over 30,000 appointments are successfully made each week under the Choice  The programs are set to expire in a few months, and, as pointed out by my colleagues, the VA has already begun to limit care for pregnant mothers, as well as cancer patients, because their treatment would extend beyond Soon all veterans will be kicked off the Choice  I would just like to point out to my colleagues, if I could, that this crisis started in Phoenix, AZ, where 15,000 veterans were put on a wait list and over 40 veterans died while awaiting care. That is not acceptable in this  I believe the Choice Program is a major step forward. The truth is, the VA has a lot more to do to provide for the care we have obligated this Nation to on behalf of those who have fought and sacrificed for our The Choice Card has made a major step forward. I hope we can consider removing any geographic or other limitations associated with it. But what the Senators from Kansas and Montana have done today is to make sure this program continues and why it is important to pass it today--not one dollar Congress authorized to care for veterans under the Choice Program should go unused.  Let me mention what we have done. There are 7 million additional appointments for veterans in their communities, and over 1.5 million veterans have benefited from using the Choice Card that they would not have had otherwise. Some 350,000 more doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are available to treat veterans. There are 235,000 appointments per month through Veterans Choice--more than 10,000 per workday. The Veterans Choice Program more than doubles the number of medical providers nationwide that treat veterans. In Arizona, 11,700 medical providers in veterans communities have treated over 100,000 disabled veterans.  The Veterans Choice Card is being used at 700 hospitals and nearly 10,000 clinics nationwide. The Western Region is paying more than 90 percent of Veterans Choice doctors in less than 30 days and answering 900,000 phone calls per month, with an average time to answer of under 25 seconds. Over 3,000 veterans received hepatitis C treatments due to Veterans Choice funding.  There are still kinks in the operation. There are still bottlenecks. There are still times when veterans' payments, particularly, have not been done in a timely fashion, as the Senator from Kansas mentioned. Hopefully, that will change now. As with any program, it had its difficulties in its beginning. But I want to tell my colleagues that we should make the Choice Card available for any veteran, no matter where they happen to reside. It should be, I believe, the basis of our next effort. But in the meantime, I want to thank again the Senator from Kansas for his hard work.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

3436,topic-id,1418,"Madam President, over the last few weeks, people across the country have continued to make their voices heard in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos--moms and dads, grandmothers and grandfathers, students young and old, and cities, towns, urban, suburban, and rural communities. People are standing up and they will not be silenced. Thousands upon thousands have joined protests in their communities. Hundreds of thousands have emailed or called their Senators, jamming our phone lines, swamping the voicemail system, and shattering records. Millions have engaged on social media, sharing information with their friends, signing petitions, and pressuring their elected officials.  It has made a difference. Every single Democrat will be standing with their constituents and opposing Betsy Just last week, two Republicans announced their opposition as well. I can tell you I know for a fact there are other Republicans who are feeling the heat and could come around.  This nomination is dead even right now, on the razor's edge. Fifty Senators, Democrats and Republicans will vote to reject Betsy We need just one more Republican to join us, to stand on the side of students, parents, and public education in America and say no to Betsy  I come to the floor to kick off the final day of debate on this nomination. On Friday, I spoke at length, making my case for why the Senate should oppose Betsy Democrats will hold the floor for the next 24 hours, until the final vote, to do everything we can to persuade just one more Republican to join us.  I strongly encourage people across the country to join us. Double down on your advocacy, keep making your voices heard for these last 24 hours.  Over the past 3 weeks, I have heard a number of Republicans wonder why Democrats and so many parents and teachers across the country were so focused on this nomination in this moment. President Trump has done so much in these first few weeks, and so many of his people he has nominated to run critical agencies have not been people I can support, but what is it about Betsy DeVos that has inspired so much grassroots energy and opposition across this country?  I think I understand. It is very clear to me. For the vast majority of people across the country, public education isn't just another issue, it is different. For those of us who owe everything we have to the strong public education we received, for those who saw our children and grandchildren move through our public schools, for those of us who walked into a public classroom ourselves to teach or have friends or family who have dedicated their lives to teaching, for those of us who see the role strong public schools play in our communities, especially our rural communities, often offering an educational and a community resource where it simply wouldn't otherwise be offered, we believe that a commitment to strong public schools is part of America's core, the idea that every student in every community should have the opportunities that strong public schools offer. This is a notion that is embedded in our values. It is who we are. It is in our blood.  For those people across the country who feel that way, who believe those things, the nomination of Betsy DeVos truly hits close to home. It was a slap in the face because she doesn't approach this the way most of us do. She doesn't cherish public education. She doesn't value it. She is someone who has dedicated her career and her inherited fortune to privatizing public schools, to tearing down public education, to defunding it in order to push more taxpayer dollars into private schools and for-profit charters. She has called public education ``a dead end.'' Where she sits from a distance, she has called it ``an embarrassment.'' She has disparaged those who work in our public schools, saying our best and our brightest ``steer clear.'' She has said education is ``an industry.''  An industry? Well, for someone such as she, a billionaire, rightwing activist who spent her career and inherited fortune buying and selling companies, she just doesn't understand an ``industry'' that isn't focused on profits and that doesn't exist in the free market. When people across the country hear someone such as Betsy DeVos say these things about public education, when they hear a rightwing conservative billionaire more focused on her antigovernment ideology than helping our students, when they see that someone who spent her career trying to destroy public schools has been nominated to lead the Federal Agency dedicated to public education, they start to pay some attention.  In a Senate hearing, when they see that person so clearly lack any of the issues, when they see her unable to explain basic concepts in education policy, unwilling to make basic commitments to not privatizing or defunding our public schools, confused about the need for Federal protections for students with disabilities and so committed to a rightwing agenda that she pointed to the need for guns in our schools to protect against ``potential grizzly bears'' in response to a question from a Senator representing the Newtown families, people across the country pay even more attention, and they start to make their voices heard.  I am not surprised that opposition to Betsy DeVos has caught fire across the country. I am not surprised people are talking about it to their friends, writing letters to the Senators, and showing up to protest when they have never done anything like that before because this is about their kids, their schools, and their communities. It is about the core idea that we are a nation that invests in strong public education and one that strives to guarantee the promise and opportunity it affords to every student in our country--not that public education is perfect, of course not. We have a lot of work to do, but that work should be directed toward strengthening public schools, not tearing them down. Public education is something that should be valued as an important piece of the fabric of this Nation and the expansion of our middle class, not scorned and ridiculed by billionaires who never had any use for it themselves.  Friday I spent a lot of time on the floor laying out my case in detail opposing Betsy I talked about the open questions that are remaining regarding her tangled finances and potential conflicts of interest. I ran through the strong concerns with her record, her lack of experience, and her lack of clear understanding of basic education issues. I discussed my strong belief that her vision for education in America is deeply at odds with where parents, students, and families across our country want to go. I went through the process of how Republicans jammed this nominee through our committee, cutting corners and doing everything possible to protect her from scrutiny. I will not go through all of that again now, but I do want to make one more point, one I hope will be compelling to my Republican friends who are still resisting pressure from their constituents and sticking with Betsy DeVos; that is, no matter what you think about Betsy DeVos's policy ideas, no matter what you think of her qualifications to run this agency, no matter[[Page S688]]what you think about her personal understanding of the issues or her financial entanglements, one thing is very clear; if she is confirmed, she would enter this job as the most controversial and embattled Secretary in the history of this She would start this job with no credibility inside the agency she is supposed to lead, with no influence in Congress, as the punch line in late-night comedy shows, and without the confidence of the American people.  A vote for Betsy DeVos is a vote for a Secretary of Education who is likely to succeed only in further dividing us on education issues and who may try to take steps to try to implement her anti-student agenda but would do so with people across the country. So many of us in the Senate are on guard and ready to fight back.  I urge my Republican friends--and we just need one more--let's cut this off right now. Let's ask President Trump to send us someone who is qualified, who understands the issues, and who truly cares about public education. Together, let's stand with our constituents and say no to Betsy  Madam President, I yield the floor.

3478,topic-id,314,"Mr.President, over the course of this debate, over the last 9 hours, plus 6 hours on Friday of the 30 hours that we have on this, many Senators have come to the floor to talk about their concerns about the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of  There are open questions about her extensive financial entanglements. There are open questions and a clear concern about her lack of understanding of basic education issues. We have heard that time and again, as well as the many ways in which her vision for our education system is really at odds with where families and communities nationwide want us to go.  But let me take just a moment to focus on one major concern in particular. It is a public health threat that I know is deeply concerning for families and communities across this country, and that is the epidemic of sexual violence on our college campuses. One out of five women and 1 out of 71 men are sexually assaulted while in college. In 2013 alone, college campuses reported 5,000 forcible sex offenses, and a recent study indicated that number could be much greater.  There should be no question that sexual violence on our campuses is a great, widespread, and unacceptable problem--one that I expect any incoming Secretary of Education to be informed about, to be concerned about, and committed unequivocally to confronting head-on.  Much of the discussion so far has been about the commitment of a Secretary of Education to our K-12 system. Serious concerns have been raised, but it is important to know in this debate that the Secretary of Education also has responsibility over our higher education institutions.  In our hearing, Betsy DeVos actually agreed with me that President Trump's horrifically offensive leaked comments from 2005 describe sexual assault. She was clear. But I was deeply disappointed, to say the least, in ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS685-7.txt,1409,IMPROVING ACCESS TO MATERNITY CARE ACT,2017.0,6.0,February
3483,topic-id,831,"Mr.President, I wish to thank the Senator from New Jersey, who has given us such a compelling reason to remind all of us why we are here at almost midnight and why we all intend to keep talking and keep working and keep trying to convince one more Senator to say no to this nominee. He reminds us of the basic principle in this country that our forefathers dreamed of and that they put into our Constitution and that we have fought for, which is that every child should have dignity and every child should have a public education. That is why it is so important that we have someone who leads this agency who shares that conviction. I really want to thank Senator Booker for his tremendous words tonight.  As the ranking member on this committee, who has been here throughout the Friday debate and through the 12 hours of debate we have had tonight and we will continue to have up until the vote tomorrow, I have had the opportunity to hear many Senators speak passionately. Senator Tester was here on He is from a very rural State, and he was speaking about how important it is to not have funds robbed away from the public education systems in those small little school districts to go to students with vouchers for private schools that don't exist in those rural communities. He talked about the importance of our public schools and our public school institutions in a slightly different way than the Senator from New Jersey did. He talked about how, when his grandparents settled in Montana, instead of being ranchers like those before them, they were wheat farmers. There were cattlemen and wheat farmers who were fighting and at odds with each other in the community, and where they came together was in their schools, because both cattlemen's kids and ranchers' kids were in the same school, and they played basketball together, and it healed the wounds of that community.[[Page S740]]  The Senator from New Jersey just talked about the Office of Civil Rights and why it is so important--that no matter what we look like or what this country stands for, this country says you have a right to an education. It is in our public schools where kids from all strata and all economic lives, with different backgrounds and different colors and different religions and different thoughts come together and heal our communities.  That is what is at risk with this nominee, and that is why so many Senators on our side have said: To one more Republican Senator, send this nomination back to the President who campaigned saying: Let's heal this Nation; let's bring people together; send us a nominee who actually does that.  Again, I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey and all of the Senators who have been here to speak about how important it is to have a public education.  I wouldn't be in the Senate tonight without a public education. I come from a family of nine, and my father, who was a World War II veteran, got sick when I was in junior high. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. My mom had been at home taking care of seven kids. She didn't have a job. She didn't have skills. We didn't know what was going to happen to us. But we had a public education system that was there for us. Our country was there for us with a public education system--not with a voucher that said you can go to a private school that we couldn't afford even with it or to be able to get one, but a public education school in our community that gave the education to each one of those kids in my family--all seven of us. Then it allowed us to go on to college with Pell grants and student loans, because our government was there for us, even though my dad was sick and my mom had to stay home and take care of him. We had food stamps for a while, and it was tough, but we made it because this country had a commitment to public education for every student, no matter where you lived or where you came from or what challenges you had at home.  That is why I am here in the Senate, and that is why many of us are here in the It is why this nominee has sparked such an interest across this country. Like many Senators--I think, like all Senators--my office has been inundated with mail and phone calls and emails and rallies and people saying: Please, stop this nominee, and send us someone who can actually work for all of us, because education is a critical piece for each one of us.

3398,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump and Speaker Ryan have said that the Affordable Care Act that we have now is a disaster, that it is a calamity.  There are problems with it. For some people in some plans, premiums are too high.  So what do the Republicans want to do?  Raise the premiums.  For some people in some plans, deductibles are too high.  So what do the Republicans want to do?  Make the deductibles much higher.  Let's get away from the rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act and look at what the Republicans plan to do with the bill that we are going to be voting on presumably in the next few days: raise the premiums, raise the deductibles.  They say that you will not be disqualified for preexisting conditions and that you will still be able to get insurance, but not if you let your coverage lapse in 6 months. If you are laid off from your job and you lose your insurance and 6 months later you get insurance, no, you are going to have to pay a 30 percent higher premium in order to get coverage. So their guarantee is worth nothing.  What does the bill that we are going to be voting on do?  This bill would throw 24 million people off of coverage. Twenty four million Americans would lose their health care, the security of mind that they have now. This bill would destroy about 2 million jobs. This bill would force families to pay higher costs, higher premiums, higher deductibles.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a 50- or 60-year-old person making $26,000 and who, under ObamaCare, is paying, after the subsidies, out of pocket $1,700 a year for health insurance, will, under this new Republican bill, after the appropriate subsidies that this bill will give, pay not $1,700, but $14,000 on a pretax income of $26,000.  So this bill will increase costs, throw 24 million people off of coverage, and impose an age tax. People above 50 years old will have to pay five times as much as younger people for insurance, a very crushing age tax.  Why? Why do this?  Because they say people need more freedom to choose their health care.  People don't need more freedom to choose their health care. People need better health care. They need coverage. They need security. They need coverage that will take care of their health needs at a low cost. That is what they need.  The ObamaCare, the existing bill that we have, the Affordable Care Act, gives them that, not as well as it should. We should make improvements to it. It is not an improvement to throw 24 million people off of coverage, increase the cost, and institute a crushing age tax.  Why?  It is to give a tax benefit of $2.8 billion to the richest 400 families in the United This bill would be the largest transfer of wealth from low- and mostly middle-income people to the top 1 percent in American history.  Let me just address one last thing. People are being bribed to vote for this bill. People are being bribed legally. Provisions are being put in the bill to say: Hey, if you vote for this bill, you will benefit, your State will benefit.  There is nothing wrong with that. It has been done before.  Let's take a look at one of those bribes, the so-called New York bribe. New York, along with 15 other States, takes advantage or utilizes a provision in the law that has been in the law since 1965 in Medicaid in which the State share of Medicaid is borne partially by the State and partially by local governments. Sixteen States have elected to do that.  This bill says that New York State only will be prohibited from sharing the burden of Medicaid with local governments. So $2.3 billion will be shifted from various local governments onto the State's taxpayers, except for New York Upstate counties will lose their share. New York City will have to keep it. The State will have to bear the burden. So it is a $2.3 billion increase for State taxpayers.  Now, eight Republicans, we are told, from upstate New York are going to vote for this bill just because of that. They don't like the bill in other respects, but because of that provision, which will relieve some of the burden from local counties, they are going to vote for the bill; and they say so. Representative Collins of New York said so. He would vote for that bill. He got a number of other people to agree. That is why the provision is in the bill.  But it is not going to happen. It is flatly unconstitutional. They are selling their votes for something that is never going to happen, and that is just wrong. This bill should not be approved. It is a sellout to the people of the entire country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2297.txt,850,IMPROVING ACCESS TO MATERNITY CARE ACT,2017.0,22.0,February

Only because the court had gotten such significant criticism did it reverse its decision. Apparently even the very shaky President of Venezuela, Maduro, weighed in to get them to reverse their decision. Now, isn't that something? This is supposed to be a democracy. Yet it is being run as a dictatorship, where even the judicial branch goes and does something crazy and the President of the country gets up and tells them: You had better reverse yourself; there is too much criticism.  This is the nonsense that is going on in Of course, what went on last week further undermines Venezuela's so-called democracy, and it is only the latest in President Maduro's creeping dictatorship. That is what it is.  He has repeatedly and violently suppressed protesters and jailed his political opponents in violation of any understanding of human rights. He has used that same Supreme Court to block members of the National Assembly from taking office, and he has used that Supreme Court as a rubberstamp to overturn the laws that the National Assembly does that he doesn't like. Isn't it a sad state that Venezuela has reached?  The President has also thwarted opposition efforts to recall him, President Maduro, in a national referendum. In so doing, he was able to appoint a Vice President with ties to Hezbollah, and now a Vice President it appears that he has sanctioned for drug trafficking.  Meanwhile, the poor Venezuelan people suffer the consequences of the political, humanitarian, and economic[[Page S2405]]crisis. Venezuelans are dying because of severe shortages of food and medicine and other products. The economy is in freefall, and crime and corruption are rampant.  Last year, 18,000 Venezuelans sought asylum in the United States--more than any other nationality. The United States stands clearly on the side of the Venezuelan people in calling on President Maduro to cease undermining democracy, release all political prisoners, respect the rule of law, and respect human rights.  There obviously is no sign that he is going to be doing this. What should we do? First of all, we ought to get our Secretary of State to work with the international community, including the Organization of American States, to help resolve this crisis and alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people.  That is the first order of business, to try to eliminate the suffering of people. It is all so true; whenever a dictator takes control, as has happened in Venezuela, it is the people who suffer first.  Additionally, I am suggesting and I am calling on the administration to fully enforce and, where appropriate, expand the sanctions on those responsible for continued violence and human rights violations that are perpetrated against the people.  It is very interesting. A lot of these so-called big guys in Venezuela love to travel. They love to have bank accounts. They love to come to They love to have U.bank accounts. Let's slap some severe economic sanctions on these guys. The situation is increasingly dire, and we must stand with the Venezuelan people in their struggle for democracy and human rights.

3614,topic-id,625,"Mr.President, while we have a lull in the debate, I want to take an opportunity to talk about healthcare. Since we had an utter inability of the House of Representatives to come together on any kind of healthcare bill, this Senator would suggest that instead of the mantra ``repeal and replace,'' since now that seems to be dead, why don't we take the existing law that has provided a lot of things for the average citizen? For the average person in my State of Florida, it means a great deal to have the availability of health insurance, which they never had and can now afford.  There need to be fixes to the law known as the Affordable Care Act that was passed several years ago. Indeed, one of those fixes could be a kind of ``smoothing fund,'' that as the insurance companies vie for this business on the State exchanges, they would be able to have this fund as a resource for them to get over some of the humps--also, certainly for some of the insureds.  Just because you are at 400 percent of poverty and therefore no longer eligible for some of the subsidies to enable you to buy health insurance--and, by the way, for a single individual, that is only about $47,000 a year of income--the person who makes $47,000, $50,000 a year can't afford to go out and spend $8,000, $10,000, $11,000 on a health insurance policy.  We need to adjust that--in other words, fix that as well. There needs to be an additional fix of a subsidy for the people who are just over 400 percent of poverty. To translate that another way, for a family of four, that is only about $95,000 a year. On a tight budget like that, they simply can't afford health insurance. They need some help.  With a few little fixes like that to the existing law--the Affordable Care Act--we could get this thing tuned up and, indeed, continue to provide what we need in order for people to have healthcare.  One other fix: There are about 4 million people in the country who, if their State legislatures and their Governor would expand Medicaid--and some of those Governors are now expressing interest in doing this--under the Federal law up to 138 percent of poverty, 4 million more people would be covered with healthcare. In my State of Florida alone, there are 900,000 people who otherwise would be getting healthcare who do not because the government in the State of Florida has refused to expand Medicaid coverage up to 138 percent of poverty.  How much is that? For a single individual, that is someone making about $16,000 a year. A person like that can't afford health insurance. A person like that can't afford any kind of paying for any healthcare.  What happens to them? When they get sick, they wait and wait to try to cure themselves because they can't pay a doctor. When the sickness turns into an emergency, they end up in the emergency room and then, of course, it is uncompensated care and the hospital eats it. The hospital, of course, passes that uncompensated care on to all the rest of us who are paying our premiums on health insurance.  It makes sense to do this. With a few fixes, we would be able to tune up the existing law to provide the healthcare that most of us want to provide. It seems to me that it is common sense, and it is common sense that can be done in a bipartisan way. It is my hope and my prayer that the Senate and the House will come together and ultimately do this.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from Rhode  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2383-5.txt,859,,2017.0,4.0,March
3734,topic-id,3344,"Mr.President, we are talking about taking privacy rights away from individuals if we suddenly eliminate this rule. Do you want a large company that is an internet provider, that has all the personal, sensitive information because of what you have been doing on the internet--do you want that company to be able to use that for commercial purposes without your consent? That is the issue.  If you want to protect people's privacy, I would think you would want to require that an individual who has paid money for the internet provider to provide them with the internet--you go on the internet, and you go to whatever site you want. You do business. You do personal business. You do banking. You go on the internet and you buy things. You talk about your children's school, about when you are going to pick up your children, maybe what your children want to wear to school. You want to talk on the internet about anything that is personal. Do you want that internet provider to have access to[[Page S1926]]that information to be used for commercial purposes without your consent? If you ask that question to the American people, they are going to give you a big, resounding no.  Should the internet provider use that information if you give your consent? Then that is fair game. If you give your consent so that they can alert you before a certain day--you might want to give a certain gift to your wife on her birthday, and they might have all that information, but maybe you don't want them to have the information about where your children go to school.  Personal, sensitive information is what we are talking about; therefore, the whole issue here is, do you want the internet provider to be able to use that information without the person's consent, or do you want the person to have to actually effectively opt-in in order to give the internet provider that consent? To me, this is a clear-cut case of privacy.  You can fancy it up, talking about FCC rules and so forth--and we have the author of the Telecom Act, Senator Markey, here, and he is going to talk about this and protections that were put in for telephones. But back then, remember, it was just you call from this number to this number on such and such a day for such and such a period of time. Even that was protected. But now--just think about this--we are talking about all the personal transactions that you do every day through the internet.  So I rise today in opposition to this resolution brought under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove the Federal Communications Commission's broadband consumer privacy rules. I would think that the distinguished Senator sitting in the Chair, who values privacy as he does--that this is going to be something he would be concerned about, as well as every other Senator in this Chamber, because you know that if you ask your constituents ``Do you want your privacy invaded without your consent?'' you know what the answer is going to be.  Americans care about their online privacy. They want to have control over how their personal information is exploited by third parties. In fact, a recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 91 percent of adults feel they have lost control of how their personal information is collected and then used. That same study found that 74 percent of Americans believe it is very important that they be in control of who can get information about them, and a majority believe that their travels around the internet--the sites they visit and how long they spend in that location--are sensitive information that should be protected. I hope the Senators are going to pay attention to this because we are talking about sensitive, personal information.  Do you know that your geolocation is something that you are transmitting over the internet? Do you want your location and where you have been to be in the hands of somebody who could use that for commercial purposes? I don't think so. That is why this past October the FCC provided broadband subscribers with tools to allow them to have greater control over how their personal online information is used, shared, and then sold.  The FCC has been protecting telephone customers' privacy for decades, and it updated its longstanding privacy protections to protect the privacy of broadband customers. In fact, it is safe to say that what the FCC did last October was the most comprehensive update to its consumer privacy and data protection rules in decades.  The FCC put in place clear rules that require broadband providers to seek their subscribers' specific and informed consent before using or sharing sensitive personal information and give broadband customers the right to opt out of having their nonsensitive information used and shared if they chose to do so. The FCC also gave broadband subscribers additional confidence in the protection and security of their data by putting in place reasonable data security and breach notification requirements for broadband providers.  Simply put, the FCC decided to put American consumers--each one of us who pays these monthly fees for our broadband service--in the driver's seat of how their personal online data is used and shared by the broadband provider to which they have been paying a monthly fee to use their service. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.  Please understand that broadband providers know a lot about every one of us. In fact, it may be startling, the picture that your broadband provider can develop about your daily habits and then sell to the highest bidder.  Your home broadband provider can know when you wake up every day either by knowing the time each morning that you log on to the internet to check the weather and news of the morning or through a connected device in your home.  That provider may know immediately that you are not feeling well, that you kind of feel sick, assuming you peruse the internet, like most of us do, to get a quick check on your symptoms. In fact, your broadband provider may know more about your health and your reaction to illness than you are willing to share with your doctor. Think about that.  Personal privacy? If you let this go to the highest bidder, personal privacy of sensitive information is going to be out the window.  Your home broadband provider can build a profile about your listening and viewing habits given that today most of us access music, news, and video programming over broadband.  Your broadband provider may have a better financial picture of you than even your bank or your brokerage firm or your financial adviser because they see every website you visit across every device in your home and can build a thorough profile about you through these habits.  If you live in a connected home, the home of the future--and the future is now, by the way--they may know even more details about how you go about your day-to-day activities. Your mobile broadband provider knows how you move about through the day, your geolocation. They know through information about that geolocation and the internet activity. All of that is through--guess what--this mobile device. Don't you think this is connected to the internet? And that is not to mention the sort of profile a broadband provider can start to build about our children from their birth. It is a gold mine of data, the holy grail, so to speak.  It is no wonder that broadband providers want to be able to sell this information to the highest bidder without the consumer's knowledge or consent. And they want to collect and use this information without providing transparency or being held accountable. Is this what you want to inflict upon your constituents in your State by changing this rule about their personal, sensitive privacy? I don't think so. You better know what you are doing when you vote tomorrow. This vote is coming about noon tomorrow. You better know.  As a country, we have not stood for this in the past, this kind of free utilization of information by entities that may want to have a unique look at who we are. We place stringent limits on the use of information by our doctors. We place stringent limits on our banks. When it comes to our children, I mean, that ought to be off-limits.  Broadband providers can build similar profiles about us and in fact may be able to provide more detail about someone than any one of those entities can. Passing this Senate resolution will take consumers out of the driver's seat and place the collection and use of their information behind a veil of secrecy, despite the rhetoric surrounding our debate today suggesting that eliminating these commonsense rules will better protect consumers' privacy online or will eliminate consumer confusion.  Don't fall for that argument, In fact, the resolution will wipe out thoughtful rules that were the product of months of hard work by the experts at the agency on regulating communications networks of all kinds. Those rules were crafted based upon a thorough record developed through an extensive multimonth rulemaking proceeding. The FCC received more than one-quarter of a million filings during this proceeding. They listened to the American people.  The agency received extensive input from stakeholders in all quarters of the debate, from the broadband providers and telephone companies to the public interest groups and from academics to individual consumers. We are going to wipe all of this away at noon tomorrow[[Page S1927]]with a vote that you can do it by 50 votes in this Chamber? I don't think this is what the people want.  On top of this, the rules are based on longstanding privacy protections maintained by the FCC for telephone companies, as well as the work of and the principles advocated by the Federal Trade Commission and advocated by State attorneys general and others in protecting consumer privacy. The FCC rules put in place basic safeguards for consumers' privacy based on three concepts that are widely accepted as the basis for privacy regulation in the United States and around the world: notice, choice--individual choice, consumer choice--and security, those three. They are not the radical proposals that some would have you believe they are.  First, the rules require broadband providers to notify their customers about what types of information it collects about the individual customers, when they disclose or permit access to that information, and how customers can provide consent to that collection and disclosure.  Second, the rules give consumers choice by requiring broadband providers to obtain a customer's affirmative opt in; in other words, I give you my consent before you can use or share my sensitive personal information.  As I mentioned earlier, sensitive information includes a customer's precise geographic location--I don't think you want some people to know exactly where you are--your personal information, health, financial, information about your children, your Social Security number--how many laws do we have protecting Social Security numbers--the content you have accumulated on the web, web browsing, and application usage information.  For information considered nonsensitive, broadband providers must allow customers to opt out of use and sharing of such information. Broadband providers must provide a simple, persistently available means for customers to exercise their privacy choices.  Third, broadband providers are required to take reasonable measures to protect customers' information from unauthorized use, disclosure, or access. They must also comply with specific breach notifications. In other words, if somebody has busted the internet and stolen all of this information from the site, don't you think you ought to be notified that your personal information was hacked? Well, that is one of the requirements.  So then I ask my colleagues: What in the world is wrong with requiring broadband providers to give their paying customers clear, understandable, and accurate information about what confidential and potentially highly personal information those companies collect? What is wrong with getting their consent to collect that information from their subscribers?  What is wrong with telling customers how their information is collected when they use their broadband service? What is wrong with telling customers with whom they share this sensitive information? What is wrong with letting customers have a say in how their information is used? What is wrong with recognizing that information about a consumer's browsing history and ap usage, sensitive and personal information, should be held to a higher standard before it is shared with others? What is wrong with all of that?  What is wrong with seeking a parent's consent before information about their children's activities or location is sold to the highest bidder? Do we as parents not go out of our way to protect our children's well-being and their privacy? Trying to overturn this rule is what is wrong.  What is wrong with protecting consumers from being forced to sign away their privacy rights in order to subscribe to a broadband service? I want your internet service. Do I have to sign away the rights to my private information--private, sensitive information? What is wrong with making companies take reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of consumers' data?  What is wrong with making companies notify their subscribers when they have had a breach? Again, I ask my colleagues: What in the world is wrong with giving consumers increased choice, transparency, and security online?  Supporters of the joint resolution fail to acknowledge the negative impact this resolution is going to have on the American people. This regulation is going to wipe away a set of reasonable, commonsense protections. I want to emphasize that. Is it common sense to protect our personal, sensitive, private information? Of course it is. But we are just about--in a vote at noon tomorrow, with a majority vote, not a 60-vote threshold, a majority vote here--we are just about to wipe all of that out. It will open our internet browsing histories and application usage patterns up to exploitation for commercial purposes by broadband providers and third parties who will line up to buy your information.  It will create a privacy-free zone for broadband companies, with no Federal regulator having effective tools to set rules of the road for collection, use, and sale of that uniquely personal information of yours. It will tie the hands of the FCC because they cannot go back. Once this rule is overturned, they cannot go back and redo this rule. It will tie the hands of the Federal Communications Commission and eliminate the future ability to adopt clear, effective privacy and data security protections for you as a subscriber, in some cases even for telephone subscribers.  To be sure, there are those who disagree with the FCC's broadband consumer privacy rules. There is an avenue for those complaints. These same companies that are pushing the joint resolution have filed for reconsideration of the rule at the FCC, and there is a judicial system. That is the appropriate way. Go back and get the FCC to amend--if you all are so concerned--or let the judicial system work its will, but do not do it in one fell swoop in a majority rule in this body tomorrow at noon.  In fact, the critics of the FCC's rules have an open proceeding at the FCC in which they can argue on the record with an opportunity for full public participation to change and alter these rules.  If the FCC did it--you have a new FCC, a new Chairman, a new majority on the FCC--let them be the ones to amend the rules after all the safeguards of the open hearings, of the comment period, all of that. By contrast, what we are using here to invade our privacy is a blunt congressional instrument called the Congressional Review It means that all aspects of the rules adopted by the FCC must be overturned at once, including changes to the FCC's telephone privacy rules.  It would deny the agency the power to protect consumers' privacy online, and it would prevent the FCC--get this--prevent them, the FCC, the regulatory body that now has a new chairman and a new majority--it would prevent the FCC from ever adopting even similar rules. I don't think that is what we want to do because it does not make sense. That is exactly what we are about to do.  I also want to address the argument that the FCC rules are unfair to broadband providers because the same rules do not apply to other companies in the internet ecosystem. Supporters of this resolution will argue that the other entities in the internet ecosystem have access to the same personal information that the broadband providers do.  They argue that everyone in the data collection business should be on a level playing field. Well, I ask my colleagues whether they have asked their constituents that question directly. Do Americans really believe that all persons who hold data about them should be treated the same? I venture to guess that most Americans would agree with the FCC that companies that are able to build detailed particulars about you and build those particular pictures about your lives through unique insights because of what you do every day in their internet usage--shouldn't those companies be held to a higher standard?  In addition, the FCC's rules still allow broadband providers to collect and use their subscribers' information. The providers merely need to obtain consent from those activities when it comes to their subscribers' highly sensitive information.  The FCC also found that broadband providers, unlike any other companies in the internet ecosystem, are uniquely able to see every packet of information that a subscriber sends and receives--every packet of information that you[[Page S1928]]send or receive over the internet while on their networks. So if you have a provider, they are on your iPhone, and you are using them, they are seeing everything. That is not the case if you go to Google because Google sees only what you do while you are on But the internet provider, the pipe that is carrying your information--they see everything that you do.  Supporters of the joint resolution also hold out the superiority of the Federal Trade Commission's efforts on protecting privacy. They argue that there should be only one privacy cop on the beat. But, folks, that ignores reality. The FTC doesn't do everything. There are a number of privacy cops on the beat. Congress has given the FCC, the FTC, the FDA, and NHTSA regulatory authority to protect consumers' privacy.  You had better get this clear because the FCC is the only agency to which Congress has given statutory authority to adopt rules to protect broadband customers' privacy. The FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, does not have the rulemaking authority in data security, even though commissioners at the FTC have asked Congress for such authority in the past. Given recent court cases, the FTC now faces even more insurmountable legal obstacles to taking action, protecting broadband consumers' privacy.  So don't be fooled by this argument that folks are telling you over here that it ought to be the FTC, the Federal Trade As many have pointed out, elimination of the FCC's rules will result in a very wide chasm, where broadband and cable companies have no discernible regulation while internet ``edge'' companies abide by the FTC enforcement efforts.  Without clear rules of the road, broadband subscribers will have no certainty of choice about how their private information can be used and no protection against its abuse--no protection, my fellow Americans, of your personal, sensitive, private data. That is why this Senator supports the FCC's broadband consumer privacy rules.  I want to encourage my fellow Senators: You had better examine what you are about to do to people's personal privacy before you vote to overturn this rule tomorrow.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the joint resolution.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

3796,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Denton, Texas (Mr.Burgess) for yielding me time to speak about my bill, H.309, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that received unanimous support in the last Congress and was cosponsored by over half of my House colleagues.  It had this level of support because our Nation faces an epidemic. Diabetes or prediabetes affects over 100 million Nearly one in three of our neighbors is affected. This is in addition to all of the Americans whose diseases fall under complex metabolic, autoimmune, or insulin-resistant diseases.  When I first came to Congress in 2009, it was crystal clear that we had a big problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars going into these diseases were simply not making their way to patients. Researchers at the NIH, the CDC, the FDA, and even DOD weren't sharing diabetes research.  It was clear to me in 2009, and it is clear today in 2017, that we need a laser-like focus on improving patient care by pursuing a strong Federal focus on research.  My bill accomplishes that goal by creating a national clinical care commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for patients. This commission will have 3 years to strengthen their partnership between Federal stakeholders and health professionals, who will bring hands-on clinical experience to improve care.  This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this commission will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone.  We have already made a huge investment of taxpayer dollars into research. It is time for us to leverage that investment and translate that into meaningful prevention and effective treatment options.  So today, I ask my colleagues to again help those who suffer from diabetes or other complex metabolic and autoimmune disorders by voting for H.309.

Broadcast and cable networks provide crucial information that helps us stay out of harm's way, and phone and Internet access makes sure we can call for help and keep track of our loved ones.  Unfortunately, when Sandy ripped through the Northeast, many of these networks went down when we needed them most. Across the region, nearly 1 in 4 cell towers were knocked out. But in some of the hardest-hit areas of New Jersey, as many as half of the towers were actually down. Many of them stayed down for weeks. That is why I have spent the past several years figuring out what went right and what went wrong.

3691,topic-id,393,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.584, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, since I became ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications 4 years ago, States have repeatedly expressed concern about the ability to confront the cyber threat and have rated cybersecurity among the core capabilities in which they had the least confidence.  Last Congress, the subcommittee held a hearing on State and local efforts to counter the cyber threat where State emergency managers and chief information officers testified about activities they were undertaking to secure their networks and infrastructure.  For example, my home State of New Jersey has begun developing its own cyber information-sharing capability, similar to DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration  Since the subcommittee held its hearing last year, the Federal Government has made significant progress in providing cybersecurity guidance to Federal, State, and local stakeholders.  In December of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security issued its national Cyber Incident Response Plan, which describes roles and responsibilities among stakeholders with respect to preventing, disrupting, and responding to a cyber event.  Additionally, the plan also provides guidance on information sharing related to cyber threats.  H.584 would help facilitate implementation of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan by promoting the sharing of cyber threat indicators and information, as well as cybersecurity's best practices, with State and major urban area fusion centers.  The bill also designates ``cybersecurity'' as an allowable use of State Homeland Security grants and Urban Area Security Initiative funds, which would help other States replicate the cyber threat information-sharing capabilities developed in New  This is commonsense legislation, passed by the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again.  Mr.Speaker, last fall, the range of cyber threats we faced came into focus when a foreign government attempted to interfere and undermine the integrity of our Presidential election by hacking into the campaign and political party databases.  H.584 includes language to address this threat by directing DHS to share cyber threat information regarding election equipment and technology with fusion centers.  H.584 seems to secure our critical cyber networks by improving cyber information sharing with fusion centers on the full spectrum of cyber threats.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.584, and I yield back the balance of my time.

3643,topic-id,1860,"Mr.President, it is humbling to be on the floor of the U.Senate with colleagues like Senator Lankford from It is an honor to listen to his words, to his heart, on an issue like today because this is, I believe, a historic day.  On January 31 of this year, I had the great honor of being invited to the White House when President Donald Trump announced his nominee for Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Court, Judge Neil It was a professional rollout of this nomination, but it spoke more to the man, the individual, Judge Gorsuch, than it did to the circumstance surrounding it.  Today, I want to again discuss Judge Gorsuch's nomination and the 200-plus years of historical precedent put on the line today. As an outsider of this political process, it is clear to me what is going on here. It really has nothing to do with Judge  The minority party today abandoned 230 years of tradition because of politics, in my opinion. Never before in the U.history has a purely partisan filibuster killed a Supreme Court nomination. Never before, in the history of our country, has a partisan filibuster killed a district judge nomination. Never before, and until 2003, has a partisan filibuster killed a circuit judge nomination. Mr.President, 2003 was the first time in our history that the rules of the Senate were used in a purely partisan way to stop a judicial nomination.  In 2003, the Democratic Party threw out over 200 years of precedent when it comes to circuit judge nominees and killed a circuit judge nomination. Today they attempted to do the same thing when it comes to a nominee to the highest Court in the United  It should be noted Republicans did not attempt to do this to either Justice Sotomayor or Justice Kagan when they were nominated by President Obama a few years ago. Throughout our history, even the most controversial Supreme Court nominees have gotten an up-or-down vote, a simple majority vote. On that note, I also wish to point out there is no longstanding rule or tradition that a Supreme Court nominee must obtain 60 votes to be confirmed.  Judge Clarence Thomas was confirmed by a narrow 52-to-48 margin. Even though a single Senator could have required 60 votes to invoke cloture, and none did. Likewise, Justice Samuel Alito was confirmed by a 58-to-42 margin. Again, no Senator required 60 votes to invoke cloture. Neither of those nominees were filibustered to death. They got an up-or-down vote.  Mainstream media outlets have repeatedly fact-checked the minority party on this. For example, last week the Washington Post said: ``Once again: There is no `traditional' 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim otherwise.''  Even PolitiFact has repeatedly pointed out that ``Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate.''  Clearly, outside of this body, it is recognized in the media, and on both sides of the aisle for that matter, that there is no such thing as a 60-vote standard when it comes to the nomination and confirmation of Supreme Court  Additionally, the notion that the minority party filibustering Judge Gorsuch's confirmation is the same as our not allowing a vote last year, that logic doesn't hold up.  Last year, I joined many of my colleagues on the Senate floor in explaining why we felt it best not to give advice or consent on the nomination of a Justice to the Supreme Court during a Presidential election year. The integrity of the process, clearly outlined in article II, section 2, of the Constitution was at stake. It was about the principle, not the individual. Unlike the argument that it is tradition for a Supreme Court nominee to receive 60 votes, there is actual precedent for the position we took last year on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.  Former Vice President Biden, former Minority Leader Reid, and many other Members of both parties have agreed that the political theater of a Presidential election year should not influence the process.  The last time a Justice was nominated and confirmed by a divided government in a Presidential election year was 1888. Clearly, there is more than 100 years of precedent for the position we took last year in not giving advice and consent.  We took a position that was consistent with more than 100 years of actions and comments from Members of both parties. Let's just get over that. This year stands on its own, independently. The time for debate on this issue has come and gone.  Furthermore, it is obvious that what is at issue here is not Judge Gorsuch's qualifications. In 2006, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by a voice vote in this body with no opposition. Again, no opposition on the floor of the U.Senate, just 10 years ago.  Then-Senator Biden did not object, then-Senator Reid did not object, then-Senator Clinton did not object, and, yes, then-Senator Obama did not object. Twelve current Members of this body, including the current senior Senator from New York, the senior Senator from Illinois, the senior Senator from California, did not object to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation in 2006.  It is a simple fact, they had the opportunity to raise an objection, and they did not do it. It is obvious that what is going on here has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch's qualifications. What is at issue is nothing but pure, unadulterated politics.  This is exactly why I ran for the U.Senate, having never been involved in politics. This is what makes people home very nervous about the gridlock in this body. This is why President Trump still cannot meet with his full Cabinet today, months after he was sworn in as our This is the very cause of gridlock that I believe is causing the dysfunction in  As I said, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by voice vote with no opposition in 2006. Judge Gorsuch is a principled jurist who is steadfast in his commitment to defending and upholding the  In my private meetings with him, I have been very impressed that this is his starting and finishing point: He is there to interpret the law, not to be an activist for his own personal opinion. He boasts a unanimous seal of approval from the gold standard, the American Bar  Throughout his extensive career in both the public and private sectors and through hour after hour of testimony, Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated an impartial commitment to the rule of law. This is another area in which legal[[Page S2415]]minds from both sides of the aisle agree.  Harvard Law School Professor Noah Feldman, himself no conservative, called it a ``truly terrible idea'' to try to force Judge Gorsuch, or any judge for that matter, to base their decisions on the parties involved. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, I know that Judge Gorsuch fully understands that the job of a judge is to interpret, not make, the law.  As he himself said, ``A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.''  This commitment to impartiality, regardless of those involved in individual cases, is further evidence his nomination should be confirmed rather than filibustered to death like we have seen today.  Judge Gorsuch's record is evidence enough that he is an impartial judge committed to the The opposition has said he is outside the mainstream. That also doesn't hold up.  In 97 percent of his 2,700 cases, judges who also heard the cases unanimously ruled with Judge In 99 percent of his cases, he was not a dissenting vote. The other side is consistent in saying he is not mainstream. Seriously? How much more mainstream does he have to be?  To that point, Judge Gorsuch has drawn praise from both liberals and conservatives alike. Former President Obama's Acting Solicitor General called Judge Gorsuch ``an extraordinary judge and man.''  He is not alone in that assessment of Judge Mainstream media outlets across the country have praised this nominee to the Supreme Recently, the USA Today Editorial Board wrote: ``Gorsuch's credentials are impeccable . . . he might well show the independence the nation needs at this moment in its history.''  The Washington Post's Editorial Board wrote:       We are likely to disagree with Mr.Gorsuch on a variety of      major legal questions. That is different from saying that he      is unfit to serve.  The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote: ``No one can replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, but President Trump has made an excellent attempt by nominating appellate Judge Neil Gorsuch as the ninth justice.''  As I have noted, the minority party's move to filibuster Judge Gorsuch is not rooted in any actual precedent in the U.It also clearly has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch himself. By any and all objective measure, he is a mainstream, well-qualified nominee to the U.Supreme  That is a point agreed upon by liberals and conservatives alike. Yet here we are still today throwing out almost 230 years of tradition, purely because of politics. This body must rise above the self-manufactured gridlock.  Our last President, according to constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, created a constitutional crisis. It was caused by shutting down the Senate and creating the fourth arm of government, the regulators, and threatening the very balance of our three-branch system. It allowed the former President, through regulatory mandates and Executive orders, to basically fundamentally change the direction of the country without  Given this threat to the Constitution, at this point in our history, we absolutely need a jurist on the Supreme Court who will bring a balanced view and impartial commitment to the rule of law. It is imperative we confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch tomorrow--a principled, thoughtful jurist--to the U.Supreme  If we can't confirm this individual, who is absolutely in the middle of the profile agreed to by past Democrats and Republicans alike, who in the world will we ever be able to confirm?  Seriously, if we can't get together on this individual, who is in the mainstream in the middle of the profile? How in the world are we ever going to save Social Security, Medicare, all the other critical issues that are before this body? Bipartisan compromise is what this body was built on. I call on my colleagues to put self-interest and even party interest aside for the Nation's interest.  I count it an honor to be in this body. It is a sobering responsibility, but I am very optimistic when men or women of the character of a Neil Gorsuch are willing to go through this grueling exercise that we put them through in order to serve. Because of that, I am proud tonight to be a part of a majority that stood up and precluded this from happening.

3776,topic-id,874,"Mr.President, today I rise to talk about a critically important position in the Trump administration Cabinet: The Administrator of the Environmental Protection The EPA is charged with making sure that all Americans are safeguarded from major environmental threats to human health, where they live, where they learn, and where they work.  Originally proposed by a Republican administration, the EPA's mission has been supported by Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. Clean air to breathe and clean water to drink are basic human needs that we all must work to protect. Disagreements involving the EPA usually stem from how to best preserve our vital resources, and we certainly welcome those debates in the  Oftentimes, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to provide a check and balance to activities that pollute our air, dirty our waterways, and contaminate our land. This is why I am so troubled by the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA Mr.Pruitt's track record on environmental issues as Oklahoma's attorney general is, in a word, dismal.  I am particularly concerned about the influence of the fossil fuel industry over Mr.Pruitt's decisions and actions. As Oklahoma's attorney general, he filed 148 lawsuits against the EPA to undermine their efforts. In 13 of those cases, companies that gave political donations to Mr.Pruitt also joined in that suit. As ranking member of the Science Subcommittee, I am worried that scientific data of the Environmental Protection Agency will be minimized, suppressed, or politicalized. Mr.Pruitt has tried to instill doubt in the strong consensus of global climate change scientists, claiming that the debate on fundamental scientific principles is far from settled.  If his confirmation goes through, I am concerned that the work of EPA scientists may be edited, twisted, or buried to protect special interests and prevent necessary action. Many Michiganders are rightfully afraid that Mr.Pruitt will not enforce our bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air We have seen him fight against these very laws from his current position.  All across the Nation, communities are dealing with contamination and environmental catastrophes. Rural and urban communities alike depend on the strength of these laws as well as EPA's resources and their expertise. For example, the people of Flint, MI, are still suffering through devastating effects of a catastrophic drinking water crisis. The Environmental Protection Agency is heavily involved to make sure the drinking water in Flint will be safe and the National Safe Drinking Water Act rules will be updated. I am very concerned that the EPA will ignore the lessons learned after the Flint water crisis under Administrator Pruitt, and Flint is not the only community facing a water quality crisis. For example, Monroe County--which gets its water from Lake Erie--has seen its drinking water affected because of toxins in western Lake  Algae blooms--a result of runoff pollution--have made their way into drinking water intakes. Harmful algal blooms are a problem that scientists say will only get worse as we see higher temperatures and more precipitation in the future.  In addition to providing safe drinking water, I am concerned that enforcement of clean air policies would be weakened. Keeping our air clean isn't just about climate change. It is about keeping pollutants out of the lungs of our children. People in places like Southwest Detroit and Clair County all too often suffer the harmful impacts from poor air quality. Detroit has some of the highest child asthma rates in the entire country. Children can't learn if they are too sick to be in school.[[Page S337]]  Mr.Pruitt has a record we can look at, and it is very extreme. He has attacked measures that reduced interstate smog pollution, including protections against arson and mercury. If Mr.Pruitt has sought to weaken these protections around the country that protect us from poisons like arsenic and mercury, I think we have to ask the question, If he is confirmed, will he be protecting American families or will he be protecting the bottom line of multinational corporations?  To those who welcome Mr.Pruitt's approach of attacking the EPA, I would say strengthening our economy and our environment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, each effort depends on the success of the other. We must protect our natural resources so future generations will be able to sustainably use them.  Businesses can only attract top talent and jobs to the United States if we have clean places to live and to work and if we have a healthy workforce. Sick days brought on by environmental toxins hurt small businesses, and environmental catastrophes can decimate a lifetime's worth of equity built up by homeowners.  Smart, effective protections can be good, not just for our physical health but for our economic health as well. Previous EPA nominees from both parties have understood these basic principles. What separates Mr.Pruitt from past EPA nominees is his contempt for the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency and his disregard for the science that provides the very foundation for the Agency's actions.  Just as I would not vote to confirm a fox to guard a henhouse, I will not vote to confirm Mr.Pruitt to safeguard our Nation's environment.  I urge my colleagues to join me to oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS335-2.txt,2113,HOUSTON'',2017.0,17.0,March

3744,topic-id,614,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to have introduced the Arapaho National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act, also known as the Wedge  Frankly, Mr.Speaker, I wish all of my bills could come to the floor so quickly, within a week of introducing them. But I am very glad, on behalf of Grand County, which I am honored to represent, that we could move so expeditiously, at least through the House, through this body.  Once again, I will call upon the Senate, upon passage, to move on this bill. Again, this is another bill the House did its work on, we did pass last session, and the Senate failed to pass into law.[[Page H984]]  It is very important for Grand It is a commonsense protection of public lands. It was coordinated with local landowners and local officials, supported by the county commissioners and Federal land agencies.  The legislation involves a parcel of 10 lots in Grand County, which we and locals call the ``wedge.'' As indicated by its name, the parcel is wedged between Arapaho National Forest and Rocky Mountain National Park, effectively separating the two. Although the wedge is integral for the successful management of the public land, it remains outside of the National Forest Service boundary.  Millions of visitors already enjoy the parcel's beauty as they travel west from the 13,000-foot apex of the Rocky Mountains, along the Trail Ridge scenic byway and into the destination town of Grand Lake, in my district. The area is undeveloped. Seven of the ten parcels are already being managed by the U.Forest The owners of the remaining parcels are all in favor of this bill. It is very important to point out that all of the stakeholders are supportive of this effort in statute.  Development of the wedge parcel would significantly affect the health of Rocky Mountain National Park and hurt the adjoining Colorado River headwaters. Not only would the development harm clean water for millions, but it could also harm the economic potential for what is truly a jewel of the National Park System, Rocky Mountain National Park, supporting millions of visitors in the surrounding communities.  In recognition of these potential threats to the quality and character, as well as the economy and jobs in the area, there has been significant support locally for this bill. Supporters include everyone from local officials, like the Grand County Commissioners and the town of Grand Lake, to conservation and outdoor recreation groups, including Headwaters Trails Alliance, Conservation Colorado, and the Rocky Mountain Nature  H.688 simply responds to the wishes of my constituency--including the landholders in these areas, particularly those living in and around the wedge, as well as the visitors every year--by incorporating it into the Arapaho National Forest boundary and adding the lots owned by the Forest Service into the adjacent Bowen Gulch Protection Area, just as we did when the House passed this exact bill last year.

3644,topic-id,2583,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my strong support again for Judge Neil I spoke on the floor the other day about Judge I just heard my colleague from Georgia talk about him, and he did a terrific job.  This guy, Neil Gorsuch, is the right person for the job. He is qualified. He is smart and he is fair, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate will vote for this worthy candidate tomorrow. Let me underscore that. A bipartisan majority of the Senate will vote for this worthy candidate tomorrow. He will end up getting on the  I must tell you that I regret that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused to provide him that up-or-down vote without going through the process we had to go through today. As someone who has gone through two Senate confirmations myself, I know they are not always easy. But I will tell you, it is a whole lot better for this institution and our country when we figure out ways to work together--in this case, to continue a Senate tradition of allowing up-or-down votes.  I like to work across the aisle. I have done that through my career. I can point to 50 bills I authored or co-authored that have become law in the last 6 years. They were bipartisan, by definition, because they got through this body and were signed into law by President I have voted for President Obama's nominees before President When President Obama had a well-qualified judge here on the floor, I voted for that judge. I voted for Loretta That was not an easy vote. I took heat for it back home because I thought she was well-qualified. I think that is what we ought to do in this body.  I am disappointed in the situation we are in. I think we could have followed more than 200 years of Senate tradition and not allowed for a partisan filibuster to try to block this nomination. We chose not to do that in this body. Never in the history of this body has there been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court judge--never. Some of my colleagues said: How about Abe Fortas? That was several decades ago, and that was bipartisan. Abe Fortas was a Supreme Court Justice who had some ethics issues, and he actually dropped out of trying to get the nomination because of it. But never have we stood up as Republicans--or stood up as Democrats--and blocked a nominee by using the filibuster. It has just not been the tradition.  Instead, it has been to allow an up-or-down vote--a majority vote. There are two Justices on the Supreme Court right now who got confirmed with less than 60 votes. One is Clarence Thomas--probably the most controversial nominee in the last couple of decades, I would say. I wasn't in the Senate then, but I was watching it, as many of you were. It was certainly controversial, yet he got to the Court with 52 votes. Justice Alito was confirmed by 58 votes only 10 years ago. So these nominees were not filibustered.  By the way, President Obama's nominees, Elena Kagan and Justice Sotomayor, were not filibustered by They were given an up-or-down vote. In the history of the Senate, 12 nominations have been defeated on the floor, but, again, never a successful partisan filibuster. Even Judge Robert Bork--some of you remember that nomination. It was very controversial. His nomination was defeated in 1987. He was a Reagan appointee. But he wasn't filibustered. They had an up-or-down vote, and he was voted down.  So what are these objections to Judge Gorsuch that would rise to that level where we want to say that over 200 years of Senate tradition ought to[[Page S2416]]be shunted aside and we ought to stop this man? What are those objections? I must say that I have listened to the floor debate and talked to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I made my case. They made their case. I just don't see why this man is not qualified. He was a law clerk for two Supreme Court He served in the Justice Department and had a distinguished career there. He was also a successful lawyer in the private sector. And of course, he has been a Federal judge for a decade. So we can look at his record.  My colleague from Georgia just talked about that record. It is why the American Bar Association--a group not known to be a conservative body--decided that he was ``well qualified.'' They unanimously declared him to get their highest rating of ``well qualified.'' This is what they said about him. They said:       Based on the writings, interviews, and analyses we      scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge      Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial      branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong      but respectful voice in protecting it.  That is why the American Bar Association gave him their highest rating. Not qualified? By the way, nobody objected--nobody--for any reason, to his nomination to serve as a Federal judge, to be a circuit court judge, a level right below the Supreme Court, back in 2006. Not a single Senator objected. By the way, those Senators included Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator Barack Obama, Senator Joe Biden, and a number of Senators, of course, who are still here today with us, who chose to filibuster this nomination. So I don't know.  I heard some of my colleagues talk about some of his decisions. They have picked one or two of his decisions as judge over the past 10 years and said they didn't like the outcome, and that is why he is not qualified to sit on the Supreme I have a couple of concerns with that argument. One, Judge Gorsuch has decided over 2,700 cases. I am sure we can all find one or two of these we didn't like. That is true for any judge. As I said, I voted for a number of President Obama's nominees, and I voted against others based on the merits and based on their qualifications. It didn't mean I agreed with them--trust me--or disagreed with them on everything. The odds are very good that you agree with Judge Gorsuch's decisions a lot more than you disagree with them. You know why I say that? Because the odds are really good that you agreed with them. Let's try 97 percent, because 97 percent is the number of his decisions that were unanimous with the other judges on a three-judge panel. So 97 percent of the time, his decisions were unanimous.  Who is on these three-judge panels? Well, it is usually bipartisan in the sense that it is nominees who have been nominated by different Presidents of different parties. In the case of his circuit court, there is Judge Paul Kelly, who was appointed by President George H.There have also been several of his colleagues who were appointed by President Bill Judge Gorsuch even mentioned in his testimony that he was on judge panels. He presided with Judge William Holloway, who was appointed by President Lyndon So these three-judge panels tend to have judges that were appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike--97 percent of the time unanimous. And 98 percent of the time, his decisions were in the majority.  So again, I think the odds are pretty good that we are going to agree with Judge Gorsuch a lot more than we disagree when we look at his cases. He is a consensus builder. He is a guy who figures out how to come to a decision people agree with on different sides of the aisle, and from different points of view. That is what his record his. Actually, that doesn't surprise me at all, because he clerked in the Supreme Court for two One was Byron White and the other was Justice Anthony Those are two Justices who get a lot of heat. Byron White did, and Anthony Kennedy does--from both sides. Why? Because they tend to be in the middle. They write a lot of decisions that are consensus decisions. They tend to be that fifth vote on a 5-to-4 decision. That is whom he clerked for.  To note that somehow this guy shouldn't be confirmed for the Supreme Court because of one or two decisions just doesn't seem to be legitimate to me. This is a guy who had thousands of decisions, and the vast majority were 98 percent or 97 percent unanimous. He had one decision that was appealed to the Supreme Court because the litigants must have thought he was wrong. They took it to the Supreme Court to correct him. What happened? The Supreme Court affirmed it. They agreed with Judge  I don't know whom you could find out there among judges who has a stronger record. In every case, somebody wins and somebody loses. I get that. Think about this: Out of Judge Gorsuch's 180 written opinions, only one has ever been appealed to the Supreme Court--wow. And they agreed with his ruling.  He made it clear he makes decisions not based on the outcome he likes, but based on what the law says. He thinks his job on the court for the last decade--and going forward--is to actually look at the law and decide what the law says and what the Constitution provides, not what he wants.  I think that is the kind of judge we would want--particularly those of us who are lawmakers, right? We are the ones writing the laws. We would hope that would be respected and that judges wouldn't try to legislate. This is what he said in his testimony:       A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a      bad judge . . . I have watched my colleagues spend long days      worrying over cases. Sometimes the answers we reach aren't      ones we would personally prefer. Sometimes the answers follow      us home and keep us up at night. But the answers we reach are      always the ones we believe the law requires.  Interesting perspective. He is saying: Hey, if you like all your decisions, you are probably not a very good judge because your personal beliefs aren't always going to be consistent with what the law says or the Constitution says.  He goes on to say:       I've ruled for disabled students, for prisoners, for the      accused, for workers alleging civil rights violations, and      for undocumented immigrants. Sometimes, too, I've ruled      against such persons. My decisions have never reflected a      judgment about the people before me, only a judgment of the      law and the facts at issue in each particular case.  Again, it seems to me that is the kind of person you want on the court. Making a decision as a judge is not about ruling in favor or against somebody because you like them or don't like them. It is about applying what the law says. As he said in his testimony recently, his philosophy is ``to strive to understand what the words on the page mean . . . [to] apply what the people's representatives, the lawmakers, have done.'' That is us. That is the That is people who are elected back home by the people who expect us to be the elected representatives and to listen to their concerns and then vote. Those laws should not be rewritten by the judiciary. That is the approach he takes. I would think any legislator would want to ensure the laws we pass are applied as written. Much more importantly, that is what people want too. That is what people should insist on. We want our votes to count. We want our voices to be heard.  President Lincoln warned in his first inaugural address that if judges legislate from the bench, ``the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.''  ``The people will have ceased to be their own rulers'' if judges legislate from the bench.  I think President Lincoln was right. When judges become legislators, the people do have less of a voice. Judge Gorsuch himself summed it up. He said: ``If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of government by the people and for the people would be at risk.'' I think that is the deeper issue here.  Again, I think he is the kind of judge we should want. Judge Gorsuch and I had the chance to sit down and talk about this philosophy. We talked about his background and his qualifications. I asked him some very tough questions, as he got asked during the Judiciary Committee nomination process. His hearings were something that all Americans had the opportunity to watch. He did a great job, in my view, because he did focus on how he believes that his job is not to allow his personal beliefs to guide him but, rather, upholding the law as written and the Constitution.[[Page S2417]]  I think that approach is a big reason he has earned the respect of lawyers and judges from across the spectrum, by the way. If you look at the people who say this guy is a great judge, it goes all the way across the political spectrum.  Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, an advisor to former President Obama, said Judge Gorsuch is ``a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with distinction.'' Those of you who know Laurence Tribe, he is well-regarded, considered to be a liberal thinker on many issues. But he has looked at the guy, and he has looked at his record. He knows him. He says he is brilliant, terrific, and will do the Court's work with distinction.  Neal Katyal--you have heard about him. He was the Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, a guy who knows a thing or two about arguing before the Supreme He said Judge Gorsuch's record ``should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him. . . . He's a fair and decent man.''  This goes to what the ABA said about him: He will protect the independence of the judiciary.  Look, he is smart, no question about it. You saw him answer those questions. You have seen his record. He is qualified, as we talked about. He is certainly a mainstream judge, when you look at his opinions--98 percent of the time in the majority, 97 percent of the time unanimous. Three-judge panels. He has the support--the bipartisan support--of a majority of the  By the way, the American people, as they have plugged into this, also think he ought to be confirmed. There is a recent poll by the Huffington Post, which is not considered a conservative newspaper or entity. They said the people want us to confirm Neil Gorsuch by a 17-point margin. Why? Because they watched this. They looked at the guy. They saw the hearings. They looked at his record. People believe he is the right person to represent them on the Supreme  So, again, while I am disappointed this process has become so polarized and divisive here in this body, I am glad to see this good man take a seat in our Nation's highest I believe he deserves our support.

3554,topic-id,576,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1362, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA  I have sponsored this bill in order to honor my predecessor and a true public servant, the Honorable Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a  Born on August 15, 1943, in Vailoatai Village, American Samoa, Mr.Faleomavaega graduated from Brigham Young University in 1966 and subsequently joined the United States Army and served in  However, his career in the Army was just the beginning of his public service. Mr.Faleomavaega served as a staff member to A.Fuimaono, American Samoa's first Delegate at-large to Washington, D.C., from 1973 to 1975.  Having earned his law degree from the University of Houston, he next served as staff counsel to the Committee on the Interior and Insular  In 1981, Mr.Faleomavaega returned to American Samoa to serve as our deputy attorney general until 1984, then as our lieutenant governor until 1989. During this period, Mr.Faleomavaega reentered military service in the U.Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989.  In 1989, Mr.Faleomavaega began his tenure as the congressional Delegate from American He went on to win 13 consecutive terms, making him the longest serving Delegate to date from American  While in Congress, he diligently served the interests of his constituents as a member of both the House Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Natural  Sadly, my friend Eni Faleomavaega passed away on February 22. He is survived by his wife, 5 children, and 10 grandchildren.  I would now like to say a few personal words about the man whom I came to call a true friend.  Given that I challenged him for his seat from 1994 until 2014, when I won my first term, Eni and I had a long and complicated relationship. Though we were often at odds politically, we always treated one another with the utmost respect and grace, allowing us to form a shared bond that I am very thankful for and will never forget.  Ours was a true friendship that demonstrated that, despite whatever political differences we may have, we can all come together for the good of those we serve. While we may have had disagreements on national issues, we were very much in sync when it came to Federal policy and funding for American  As a veteran whose long-term health suffered due to his service in Vietnam, Eni dedicated his life to improving conditions for veterans in American Samoa and took great pride in securing funds to build the local VA clinic which has served our veterans well.  Therefore, I can think of no better way to memorialize his dedication to the people of American Samoa and his service to our country in uniform than having the local VA clinic in Pago Pago, which he worked so hard for, named in his honor.  I want to encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to salute my predecessor by supporting this measure so that we may honor this good man for his lifelong service and dedication to the people of American Samoa and to veterans everywhere.  This legislation satisfies all of the committee's naming criteria and is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post Number 3391.  Once again, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

3515,topic-id,422,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, again, I am pleased that the House is today considering H.240, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017.  H.240 encourages engagement between the Department of Homeland Security and technology innovators, including startups. This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to proactively engage with innovative and emerging technology developers and firms to address our vital Homeland Security needs.  Additionally, H.240 provides the Secretary with the authority to identify geographic areas in the United States where high concentrations of these innovative and emerging technology developers and firms exist and to establish personnel and office space in these areas to more effectively collaborate with these technology hubs. The Federal Government certainly needs to do a better job working with the private sector, and H.240 will help to address that.  Mr.Speaker, this bill also requires the Secretary to develop and to implement a targeted strategy to proactively engage innovative and emerging technology developers and firms.                              {time}  1630  Under this bill, the Secretary must use the strategic plan to address existing barriers to leveraging innovative and emerging technologies, and the small businesses and startup ventures that create those technologies, and to incorporate them into the Department's acquisition process.  For example, in order to keep pace, the Department of Homeland Security has established an office in Silicon Valley to encourage engagement and communication with the innovative technology developers in that area. Although it is a vital technology hub, Silicon Valley certainly is not the only technology hub in the United The Department should not be limited to a single geographic area from which to identify these emerging and innovative technologies.  Mr.Speaker, all Americans are learning that cybersecurity is national security. The impacts of cyber intrusions are being felt everywhere, from boardroom tables to kitchen tables. We have seen them undermine consumer confidence and damage a company's hard-earned reputation in just a couple of seconds. Cybersecurity is a complex and serious issue that our Nation will have to address for decades to come. So it only makes sense for us to require the Department to consider strategically just how it will engage these technology developers to strengthen the Department's ability to access innovative and emerging technologies to better combat evolving cyber threats.  I am happy to support this measure today because I believe it will move us forward, further addressing our homeland security needs by supporting technology innovation.

3615,topic-id,1451,"Mr.President, the Senate has decided on a purely partisan basis to resolve the impasse of Judge Gorsuch's nomination by invoking the so-called ``nuclear option.'' For the first time in our history, nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States may advance from nomination to confirmation with a simple majority vote in this body.  I have heard many of my colleagues ascribe blame equally to both sides, and I have heard analysts and experts say the same. One can question that diagnosis, as some very respected scholars like Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute have demonstrated that our political polarization over the last several years, and hence our current impasse, has been driven predominantly by the ever more conservative ideology of the Republican Regardless, here we are.  The Gorsuch nomination lacks the traditional level of support required for a Supreme Court seat, and the majority leader has chosen a step that Democrats clearly and emphatically rejected when we needed to confirm nominees with broad support but were blocked because they were submitted by President  I had hoped it was not too late for cooler heads to prevail. Unfortunately, adherence to the principle of 60 votes for consideration of a Justice of the Supreme Court and indeed the existing rule in the Senate was ignored, and we are at this impasse.  Since many have drawn a false equivalence between the last so-called ``nuclear option'' vote of several years ago and what occurred today, let me take a moment to explain, for my part, why I very reluctantly supported a change to the Senate precedent for nominees other than the Supreme Court in 2013.  During President Obama's tenure, Republicans necessitated more cloture votes than were taken under every previous President combined. Let me repeat that. During President Obama's tenure, Republicans necessitated more cloture votes than were taken under every previous President combined, from George Washington to George In numerical terms, Republicans demanded a cloture vote 79 times over just 5 years. In contrast--from the Founding Fathers all the way through George Bush--the Senate only faced that situation 68 times. Republicans obstructed Obama nominees more in 5 years than the United States Senate obstructed all nominees combined over the course of more than two centuries.  The bitter irony, of course, was that after a nominee would break through, Republicans often would vote overwhelmingly to confirm the very nominee they so adamantly delayed. It was clear their sole guiding principle was obstruction and delay.  Judges nominated by President Obama faced some of the longest median and average wait times under the five most recent Presidents, and President Obama tied with President Clinton for the fewest number of circuit[[Page S2406]]court nominees confirmed during that same period. All that time, judicial vacancies stacked up. Justice was delayed and denied. Critical public service roles went unfilled, and the American public came to regard Congress as a place where nothing of substance can occur.  It was under those dire and unprecedented circumstances that I reluctantly joined my colleagues to change the filibuster rules for executive nominations and judicial nominations, other than the Supreme Court--very consciously excluding the Supreme Court, which at that time was recognized as appropriate by all my Republican colleagues. But there really is no equivalence between that decision and what the majority did today.  Even in 2013, at the height of Republicans' partisan attacks on President Obama, Senate Democrats believed the Supreme Court was too important to subject to a simple majority vote. The Supreme Court is a coordinate branch of our government, and its lifetime appointees have final authority to interpret the We understood then--as we do now--that the traditional 60-vote threshold to conclude debate on the highest Court in our nation was too important to the consensus-driven character of this body to sacrifice.  I think we also have to acknowledge that a President already has nominated a consensus choice capable of earning 60 votes to a seat on the Court, and that nominee was Chief Judge Merrick The unprecedented treatment he received by the majority has already made this one of the most infamous and politicalized Supreme Court nominations in American history. It is all the more disconcerting that Judge Gorsuch witnessed Judge Garland be treated so poorly but now seems to feel entitled to his seat on the Court, even if the Senate must change its precedence to give it to him.  I already addressed this body about my deep concerns regarding Judge Gorsuch's judicial record of ideological activism and championing the powerful over the powerless, but it is worth going into greater detail on one of his opinions that is emblematic of this, and that has recently come to the fore.  In 2008, Judge Gorsuch heard what is referred to as the Luke In that case, the parents of an autistic child sought reimbursement from a school district for the cost of specialized education because the school had not provided adequate accommodations for the child under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or The case presented heart-wrenching facts that are too familiar for families affected by disabilities such as autism. The child, Luke, experienced severe behavioral issues in public and at home. His parents sought advice from the best sources available to create the most effective atmosphere for him to make progress in school. Ultimately, they recognized the public school Luke had attended could not provide the learning atmosphere required by the law for So they placed him in a different school setting.  Luke's parents exercised their rights under The Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado Office of Administrative Courts, and a Federal district court all agreed that the law entitled them to reimbursement from the school district that was not able to provide an adequate learning environment for This should have been the end of the matter, but when the school district appealed the case to the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch's decision reversed all these factfinders to hold in favor of the school district.  In order to reach his conclusion, Judge Gorsuch went to great lengths--picking and choosing passages from previous decisions--to weave a new standard that essentially eviscerated the protections under His strict interpretation of this landmark law utterly ignored congressional intent and created a new precedent that schools need only provide ``merely more than de minimis'' or, in plainer terms, just a little bit more than zero educational opportunity for children with disabilities. The immediate result of this decision was to force Luke back into an inadequate learning environment and leave his parents with yet another unexpected financial hardship. At the same time, Judge Gorsuch's new legal standard threatened to degrade the quality of education for children with disabilities all across the country.  The good news for Luke's family--and for so many others--is that the Supreme Court of the United States intervened in a rare unanimous opinion, reversing Judge Gorsuch's position--ironically during his confirmation hearings. The Nation has been spared the potential harm that could have resulted from lowering expectations for schools nationwide and leaving families like Luke's without sufficient recourse.  Yet as my colleagues and I have pointed out at every turn of this confirmation process, this is far from the only decision by Judge Gorsuch that is widely outside the mainstream of modern jurisprudence. He is not--and was never intended to be--a consensus nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that this body is divided over his nomination to the highest Court in the land, and Judge Gorsuch could not earn enough support under the 60-vote threshold.  The filibuster was intended to be an institutional safeguard that protects the minority by requiring broad consensus for major decisions by this body. It should be equally apparent in this circumstance that the filibuster did its job. A large minority of this body viewed Judge Gorsuch as too extreme for the Supreme Court, and that minority blocked cloture on his nomination. There was no national emergency, no danger, no serious consequence whatsoever that prevented the majority from reversing course and working with Democrats and the President to find a consensus nominee. In one day, the majority has lessened the distinction between our Chamber and our colleagues across the Capitol, all the while lowering ourselves further in the eyes of the Nation and opening the door to an even more polarized judiciary.  I regret that this is the case, and I hope this body can turn back from the course we find ourselves on today.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

3467,topic-id,1635,"Mr.President, I know that we are in the middle of an important debate about a topic of education in our schools. One of the topics I hope young Americans will learn more about is the state of affairs across the world when it comes to human rights.  We are a vibrant society engaged in a heated debate, as we often have been throughout our history, about items of political matters. If you look here today, there are people standing up to speak on different sides of an issue. You see that the Republican Party today controls the White House, the Senate, and the House, and yet you have people with the freedom in this country to be able to stand up and oppose that. We have seen that across the country with demonstrations and speeches and all sorts of other protected speech. We are very fortunate[[Page S718]]and blessed to live in a nation with those freedoms. That is not the case all over the world.  I wanted to take this opportunity in the midst of all of this debate and discussion about an important topic, the nomination before the Senate, to remind people that despite our differences on these issues, we are truly blessed to be able to live in a country where opposing the party in power does not mean you go to jail.  As I have been doing for some time now, I wanted to come this evening and highlight yet another example of human rights abuses that is taking place in a very important part of the world. For the past couple of years, my office and I have been highlighting human rights cases through our social media campaign. We call it hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression.''  The goals of this are to raise awareness about these cases and the individuals who are suffering at the hands of these repressive governments. We know that through history some of the oppressed people--we may not think these floor speeches matter; we may not think that mentioning it here in this forum matters, but it does to them because one of the first things oppressors tell them is that the world has forgotten about them, and they don't matter anymore. That is one of the first reasons we come: to raise awareness and let them know we know their names, we know their story, and we will continue to speak out on their behalf.  The second reason is to show their families and their loved ones that elected officials--like me here in the United States--have not forgotten them because we know that tyrants, as I said, like to tell political prisoners that they are alone in their struggle.  The third reason is to call for action, whether it is for the administration to make their causes a priority, too, or to call on these governments to release these individuals.  There is one more reason I think that this effort, hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression,'' is important. As well as all the good work being done here on both sides of the aisle in defense of human rights, promotion of democracy and the defense of God-given freedoms like religious freedom and freedom of the press and free speech, which we celebrate here even in this debate, have to continue to be pillars of our foreign policy. I hope that these cases we highlight bring those guiding principles to light.  Today, I want to discuss the cases of two Chinese political prisoners whose courageous wives I had the opportunity to meet last week when they visited in Washington, These women personally requested that I intervene on behalf of their husbands, pressing on the Chinese Government to unconditionally release them and, in the case of one, to account for his whereabouts. Perhaps just as importantly, they urged me that I press our own State Department to prioritize these cases diplomatically in the hope that these families can be reunited in the not-too-distant future.  I come here today to urge our now new Secretary of State, Mr.Tillerson, to prioritize the release of these men in his diplomatic engagement with In the coming weeks, I also expect that we will have a chance to hear from the President's nominee to be U.Ambassador to China, Governor Branstad of When he comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, I will bring up these cases and others and urge him to make their freedom a priority of his work if confirmed.  Jiang Tianyong is a 45-year-old lawyer. He was disbarred by the Chinese Government because of his vigorous human rights advocacy, including his representation of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, fellow rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, Falun Gong practitioners, and other human rights cases. Despite the risks of this work, he has been steadfast in his support of the families and of their right to lawyers and legal advocates caught up in China's sweeping nationwide crackdown on the legal community in July of 2015, which ensnared roughly 250 lawyers and advocates.  Consistent with a spate of recent media stories, Jiang's wife indicated that his family and friends lost contact with him in late November of last year. That is when a Chinese state-controlled newspaper reported he had been detained for a series of trumped-up charges.  His wife has received no formal confirmation of his precise whereabouts, and, to date, he has been denied access to a lawyer of his choosing. Even more troubling is that this is entirely legal under China's laws, even though it violates all international norms of justice. Under China's own laws, authorities may hold him, or anyone, for up to 6 months without informing his family where he is held and without allowing him to access a lawyer, conditions that the United Nations Committee Against Torture has found place ``detainees at a high-risk of torture.'' Indeed, reports over the past months about four other human rights lawyers provide detailed information about the Chinese authorities' use of torture to extract ``confessions'' and impose unbearable psychological pressure.  All of these realities underscore that China remains a country of rule by law. Congressmen Chris Smith of New Jersey and I cochair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which found in our 2016 annual report that ``the Chinese Communist Party has continued to reject the notion that the rule of law should supercede the Party's role in guiding the functions of the State.'' As such, lawyers, advocates, dissidents and others often find themselves in the party's crosshairs, persecuted under the law, rather than protected by it, and they have no recourse of justice.  A second Chinese individual I want to highlight today is lawyer Tang Jingling, who has also been disbarred for his rights advocacy. He first gained prominence as a lawyer working on cases related to village compensation, corruption, and by representing activists. In January of last year, he was convicted of ``inciting subversion of state power.'' That is the charge, and he was sentenced to 5 years in prison. He was first detained in May 2014 on suspicion of ``picking quarrels and provoking troubles.'' Just imagine that. Picking quarrels and provoking troubles is a crime in This happened, by the way, during the lead up to the 21st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, when the Chinese Government worked desperately to wipe out any discussion or memory of this historically brutal crackdown. In reality, all Tang and other activists did was participate in a nonviolent disobedience movement seeking legal and social reform in  Following his conviction, Tang eloquently wrote:       Inside the grand edifice of the court, we can see stately      and ornate furnishings and decorations, and we can see the      government employees in dignified attire. But we cannot see      the law and we can definitely not see justice.  He continues, movingly, speaking of the faith that has sustained him in the midst of injustice:       The Holy Bible has a passage that reads: ``Blessed are      those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake.'' Today,      we have been pronounced guilty, thrown in prison, separated      from our families, and have endured humiliation and      difficulties--and I am far from being able to convince and      prove to others how these tribulations could have become my      blessings. But God's will is inevitably difficult to      understand. I often pray and ask him to give me more      strength, so that I may persevere until the moment of      revelation. I dare say, in 2011, while in a secret jail, and      now in detention, almost every day I have passed has been      calm and fulfilling. I have never lost my direction.  The courage and conviction of these men should be an inspiration to us all--an inspiration that should propel us to act. I would add a reminder again of how blessed and fortunate we are to live by the grace of God in a nation where we have the freedom to speak, to object, to state our views without fear of the circumstances and the consequences that these brave men now face. The Chinese people who yearn for the protection of their most basic human rights and bravely stand with their fellow marginalized countrymen are China's greatest asset--not its biggest threat, as the government of the Communist Party wrongly believes. Any government which views its own people with such fear and hostility will, as has often been said, find itself on the wrong side of history.  So I hope more of my colleagues in this body, in the House, and especially in the administration will join their voices in support of these political prisoners and all who languish in jails, prisons, and gulags simply because[[Page S719]]they want a better life, because they want a say in their future and have bravely made these aspirations clear.

3622,topic-id,3046,"Mr.President, tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon at some point, we will, I believe, vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch to be a Justice to the U.Supreme There is so much that has been said about him and his qualifications. I have been listening to the speeches all week. Even headed to the committee hearing, I think so much had been said about him. This is a mainstream candidate. This is a mainstream judge. He is someone who voted with the majority 99 percent of the time during his time on the bench. He is someone who 97 percent of the time, in 2,700 cases, was a part of rulings that were unanimous. He most certainly, I believe, is someone who believes the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original intent of the writers, but he is certainly not someone outside the mainstream of American legal thinking, and he is certainly eminently qualified. It is interesting in that you see a broad array of individuals come forward and talk about his qualifications.  I also thought it was interesting that there really was no coherent reason for[[Page S2410]]opposing him. There are a lot of different opinions on the floor that claim he would not commit to certain decisions that people would like to see him make on the That would be true of virtually everyone who has been nominated to the Court over the last quarter century.  There is no doubt that he is someone who has certain beliefs and views about the Constitution that are reflective of the President's party, but that is what elections are about. Obviously, the great people whom President Obama appointed reflected his thinking. That is our system.  A lot of the attention, though, in this debate has been about the process that brought us here. There has been tremendous consternation about the change that no longer would there be a requirement of 60 votes in order to end debate. I think a lot of people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what has happened and how we have gotten here, and I thought it was important for the people of Florida and others who may be interested to know how I approached it, because it was something that I am not excited about or gleeful about or happy about. I would say that is probably the sentiment of most of the people here in the Yet it happened anyway.  I saw a cartoon by one of these editorial cartoonists; I am not quite sure who it was. It had this picture of both sides basically saying: This is terrible, but we are going to do it anyway.  I think it is important to understand, first and foremost, about the It is unique. There is no other legislative body like it in the world. Unlike most legislative institutions, it does not function by majority rule. It actually requires a supermajority to move forward. That was by design; it was not an accident.  The people--the Founders, the Framers--created a system of government in which they wanted one branch of the legislature to be very vibrant, active, representative of the people. They represent districts, and they have 2-year terms. Then they created another Chamber which was different in nature. At the time, the U.Senate was designed, first of all, to represent the Where the House was the people's House, the Senate was the place the States were represented.  The other thing they wanted to design was a place that was at some level possibly immune from the passions of the moment. They wanted a place where things would slow down for a moment, where we would take a deep breath and make sure we were doing the right thing. It was a wise course.  Our Republic is not perfect, but it has survived for over two centuries. In the process, it has given us the most dynamic, most vibrant, and, I believe, the most exceptional Nation in all of human history. While not perfect, the Senate has been a big part of that endeavor.  By the way, at the time, Senators were elected by the legislature; they were not even elected by people. Of course, that changed. I am not saying we should go back, but that is the way it was.  That Senate was also unique because it had this tradition of unlimited debate. When a Senator got up to speak, they got to debate as long as they wanted, and no one could stop them. Then, at some point, that began to get a little bit abused, so they created a rule that required a supermajority, and that supermajority was further watered down. Then we arrive here, over the last 4 years, to see what has happened.  Basically, what happens now is that there are two ways to stop debate, which is as a result of a procedure that was undertaken on the floor first by Senator Reid when he was the majority leader and now by the majority leader today on what is called the Executive Calendar, where there are nominations for the Cabinet, Ambassadors, the sub-Cabinet, courts, and now the Supreme 1 is by unanimous consent, when everybody agrees to it, or, 2, through 51 votes, a majority vote.  I think that is problematic in the long term, not because of Judge Neil Gorsuch, for I believe that in any other era and at any other time, he would not have just gotten 60 votes or even unanimous consent to stop debate; I think he would have gotten 60-plus votes, maybe 70 votes, to be on the I think it is problematic because we do not know who is going to be the President in 15 years or what will be the state of our country. Yet, by a simple majority, without talking to a single person or getting a single vote from the other party or the other point of view, they are going to be able to nominate and confirm and place someone on the bench of the Supreme Court--to a lifetime appointment to a coequal branch of government--without even consulting with the other side. I think, long term, that is problematic--in the case of Neil Gorsuch, not so much, but for the future of our country, I think it could be problematic.  The argument has been made that this has never been used before, so all of the stuff brings us back to where we once were. I think technically that is accurate, but this is not exactly where we once were. Where we once were was that there were people who worked here who understood they had the power to do this. They got it. They understood that if they had wanted to, they could have forced the 60 votes. They understood they had the power to do it, but they chose not to exercise it. They chose to be judicious because they understood that with the power, there comes not just the power to act but sometimes the power not to act, to be responsible, to reserve certain powers for extraordinary moments when it truly is required. And over the years, it has been abused.  This is not going to be a speech where I stand up here and say that this is all on the Democrats, although I most certainly have had quarrels over some of the decisions that have been made by the other side of the aisle. I think it is a moment to be honest and say that we all have brought us here to this point, both sides, and it has required us to do this.  The reason I was ultimately able to vote for the change today is that I am convinced that no matter who would have won the Presidential election and no matter which party would have controlled this Chamber, that vote was going to happen. Both sides were going to do this because we have reached a point in our politics in America where what used to be done is no longer possible, and that has ultimately found its way onto the floor of the U. Rules are rules, and ultimately the Republic will survive the change we have seen here today. I think the more troubling aspects are the things that have brought us to this point.  A couple of days ago, while at a lunch with my colleagues, I said that one of the things, I think, we are going to have to accept is that, quite frankly, the men and women who served in this Chamber before us--20, 30 years ago--were just better than we are. They were human beings who, quite frankly, had deeply held beliefs. I do not know of any Member of this Chamber who was more conservative than Barry Goldwater or Jesse I do not know any Member of this Chamber who was more progressive or liberal than Hubert Humphrey or Ted Kennedy or others. Yet somehow, despite their deeply held principles, these individuals were able to work together to prevent what happened here today.  The fact is, for both sides, that is not possible anymore. Today, our politics require us to use every measure possible, even if it is for symbolic purposes. That is just the way it is. That is more of a reflection of our political process than it is of the  I have seen these articles that have been written of ``the end of the Senate'' or ``the death of the Senate.'' It is a little bit of an exaggeration, but I think it is actually just reflective of the fact that this is the way politics has become, that as a nation today, we are less than ever capable of conducting a serious debate about major issues in the way we once were able to do. I think everyone is to blame.  I think the way politics is covered is to blame. Today, most articles on the issues before us are not about the issues before us; they are about the politics of the issues before us. Today, most of the work that is done in this Chamber and in the other Chamber has more to do with the messaging behind it than it does with the end result of where it will lead us. That is just the honest fact.  Before people start writing or blogging: Well, look at all of these other times when the Senator from Florida--when I did some of these things--I admit it. I do not think there[[Page S2411]]is a single person here with clean hands on any of this. I admit that I have been involved in efforts that, looking back on some of these things, perhaps, if we knew then what we know now, we would have done differently. I think it is important in life to recognize and learn from those experiences and to adapt them to the moment before us.  I think, moving forward, the biggest challenge we will face in the country is that our issues are not going to solve themselves. They will require people from very different States, very different backgrounds, and very different points of view to be able to come together and solve some pretty big deals. It is ultimately not about silencing people or having them compromise their principles but about acknowledging that in our system of government, we have no choice but to do so. We have no choice.  I think it also requires us to take a step back and understand that the people who have a different point of view than ours actually believe what they are saying. They hold it deep, and they represent people who believe what they are saying. I say this as someone who will admit that, in my time of public service, perhaps I have not always applied that as much as I wish I had. I try to. You certainly live and learn when you get to travel the country and meet as many people as I did over the last couple of years. I certainly think that impacts us profoundly.  I have a deeply held belief in limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense and the core principles that define someone as a conservative. But I have also grown to appreciate and understand the people who share a different point of view--perhaps not as much as I hope to one day be able to understand and respect it, but certainly more than I once did, simply because the more people you meet, the more you learn about them, and the more you learn and understand where they are coming from.  Are we capable as a society to once again return to a moment where people who have different ideas can somehow try to figure out how to make things better, even if the solutions are not perfect? I hope so, because the fate of the most important country in human history is at stake. Are we capable of once again having debates, not that aren't vibrant and not that from time to time people may say things or even do things that they may regret, but certainly ones that at the end of the day are constructed for the purpose of solving a problem, not winning an election. I hope so, because if we don't, we will have to explain to our children why we inherited the greatest country in human history and they inherited one that is in decline.  I don't mean to exaggerate, because ultimately this is a rule change. We don't vote on the Supreme Court every day, every week, every month. Sometimes we don't vote on it for long periods of time. But I think it exposes a more fundamental challenge that we face today in American politics, and that we better confront sooner rather than later, and that we should all confront with the understanding and the knowledge that none of us come to it with clean hands.  We were reminded again this week by the images that emerged from Syria of what a dangerous world we live in, and we are reminded that the threats remain.  I ask people tonight--no matter who you write for, who you blog for, what political party you are a member of, or whom you vote for in November--to ask yourself a question and to be honest about the answer. If, God forbid--and I mean this, God forbid--there were another 9/11-style attack on the United States, how would we honestly react? Because September 11 was a scary day, and on that day I remember there weren't Democrats or Everyone was equally frightened and everyone was equally angered. There was a sense of unity and purpose that we had not seen in a long time and have not seen since.  I honestly believe, sadly, that if today there were another 9/11-style attack on America, one of the first things we would see people doing is blaming each other, saying whose fault it was. You will have some people saying: Well, this terrorist attack happened because President Obama didn't do enough to defeat the terrorists. And others would say: It happened because the Republicans and the new President, President Trump, has not done enough, or has done things to provoke them. I honestly believe that. I think that is what the debate would look like. I hope I am wrong.  Just think about how far we have come in almost 20 years, 15 years. That is the kind of debate I believe we would have. Think about how destructive that is.  I also think we would see a plethora of crazy, fake stories about what was behind it. And here is the craziest part: Some very smart and educated people would believe those stories because we have reached the point now where conspiracies are more interesting than facts.  I know that people may see this and say: Oh, I think you are exaggerating. Maybe, I hope so. But I honestly think that we are headed in a direction that is actually making us--not us the Senate, but us, Americans--incapable of confronting problems.  I will just say this. What I really hope will happen soon is that we are going to get tired of fighting with other Americans all the time, that we will finally get fatigued with all of this constant fighting against other Americans are not your enemies. Quite frankly, I hope we have no enemies anywhere in the world, other than vicious leaders, and we hope to be a part of seeing taken them out of power at some point for the horrible things they do. I hope we will reach a point where people are saying, I am just tired of constantly fighting with other We will have differences and we will debate them. Thank God that we have been given a republic where we have elections every 2 years and where we can have these debates. But, in the interim, whether we like it or not, none of us is going anywhere.  The vast and overwhelming of majority of Americans will live in this country for the rest of their lives. This is their home and this is their country. We are going to have to figure out how to share and work together in this unique piece of land that we have been blessed with the opportunity to call home. If we don't figure out a way to do that soon enough, then many of these issues that confront America will go unsolved, and not only will our people pay a price and our children pay a price, but the world will pay a price.  So I know that is a lot to say about a topic as simple as a rule change and ultimately a vote for the Supreme Court, but I really think it exposed something deeper about American politics that we had better confront sooner rather than later, or we will all live to regret what it leads to, and that is the decline of the single greatest Nation in all of human history.  With that, I yield the floor.

He was a high school coach in Miami and won State championships there. He comes from a hard-working family of Cuban exiles who made their home in South So we are very, very proud of what he has achieved.

It is fitting that it now be named after him.  Eni was someone I looked to as a leader. He was the dean of the Territories Caucus when I first came to Congress in 2009. He had served here for some 20 years by that point; but his experience was even more longstanding, having worked on the staff of Representative Philip Burton, a champion of the territories and all of the people in America who are often overlooked and forgotten.  There were two things in particular I saw in First, he had absolutely no hesitation in representing the people of American Samoa and providing glimpses of the culture with the rest of us. He relished the opportunity to wear his lavalava, one of the traditional pieces of clothing. He took pride in his traditional tattooing. He never hesitated to[[Page H1547]]sing the songs of his people 8,000 miles away.

Of course, we are here to be sure that the people and place we represent are treated fairly and that our special circumstances are taken well into account in the formulation of Federal law and policy; but beyond that local responsibility, we all have a larger responsibility to act and speak on behalf of our Nation as a whole.  Eni certainly demonstrated that larger role we must all accept by his advocacy for Native Americans and by taking leadership in the foreign affairs of our Nation, especially in Asia and the island nations of the South A good Member of Congress takes care of their own people, just as Eni did.

3727,topic-id,655,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding and for managing the time here.  I bring forward this FCC Consolidated Reporting Act because this is a bill that focuses on streamlining government. It focuses on really establishing and identifying areas where we need to improve competition in the telecommunications marketplace and make recommendations to Congress that can help us make better policy for the country. At the same time, we are eliminating a lot of unnecessary reports that are currently burdening not only the people who are out there creating jobs but also the FCC by having eight different reports that are required annually to be filed and to be evaluated by the FCC at disparate times throughout the year, to consolidate all that into one report, one report that focuses on the entire telecommunications marketplace on a biennial basis. That report would come in at the end of the 2-year period so that each new Congress would be presented with very relevant and much more timely information that would help each Congress evaluate if changes and reforms need to be made to the law.  What laws am I talking about, Mr.Speaker? I am talking about in the current marketplace some of these various disparate reports where you might have throughout the year a requirement where a report has to look just at the satellite industry or a report looks just at the cable industry or a report looks just at the landline industry. Mr.Speaker, as we know, all of these industries now compete against each other, and whether you are getting your telecommunications data at home, through a cable, through fiber, through satellite, on your mobile device, it is all ultimately the same content that people are consuming, and all of these companies are competing against each other.  It is not like in the old days where you just had telephone lines and the telephone companies would compete against each other, and then cable companies would compete against each other. Now it is a consolidated marketplace, and it is time that we get all these disparate reports that are outdated and bring them all into one place.  When you look at what this means, they say time is money, and so when all of these reports are required by Federal law, where all of these different entities have to put together reports and a lot of times create documents, paperwork that is unnecessary, that is outdated, that doesn't really reflect what is happening in the marketplace, that is time that they can better spend creating jobs, Mr.It is time they can better spend reinvesting so that we can have better broadband as consumers, families across the country that use all of this great telecommunications infrastructure. Let's focus more on competing and creating a better marketplace.  Something else this bill does is get rid of some outdated laws, Mr.Do you know there is still a requirement in Federal law, that we get rid of in this bill, that there is a requirement every year that there has to be a telegraph report that studies competition in the telegraph industry. Mr.Speaker, this might have been useful back in 1934 when Congress mandated it. You can go back to the 1830s when Samuel Morse invented the telegraph, but we don't really need to be spending time and legal requirements that there be a report filed annually on competition in the telegraph industry. We get rid of that in this bill.  So often we hear from people around the country, when Congress is contemplating new laws, when are they going to get rid of some of the old laws that are unnecessary on the books? We actually do that in this bill. This has bipartisan support. It is a commonsense piece of legislation that actually streamlines government and focuses on helping increase competition for families across this country.  I urge adoption of this piece of legislation.  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH586.txt,1892,ARAPAHO NATIONAL FOREST BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,April
3775,topic-id,1482,"Mr.President, having Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA is bad for the air we breathe and the water we drink, and it is bad for American leadership on climate. It is not just that I have a different view from Mr.Pruitt on the Environmental Protection Agency, it is that he has made a career out of undermining the Clean Air and Clean Water It is not just that he is a Republican or that he doesn't share my views about clean energy.  Look, I understand that when a Republican administration comes in, their EPA nominee is going to have a different view of what the Agency ought to be doing. I am not suggesting that we are going to get Henry Waxman or Jeff Merkley to run the That is not what is going on here. Here is what it is, and I want people to listen carefully.  Scott Pruitt is a professional climate denier. That is his job. He has made his political bones trying to shred the EPA's ability to enforce the laws that protect clean air and clean water. The core mission of the EPA is to safeguard public health by enforcing the laws on the books, and the cornerstones of the EPA's authorities are the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water These laws were passed over 40 years ago with huge bipartisan majorities, and they have been extremely successful.  It is especially important for the dozens of young people watching C-SPAN right now to understand that the state of the environment in the late 1960s was catastrophic, like out of a science fiction movie. Even for those of us who were around, it is a good reminder of what the EPA has accomplished over the decades.  The Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it caught on fire. Lake Erie was so polluted that almost nothing could live in it. Bacteria levels in the Hudson River were 170 times above levels that could be considered safe. Raw sewage was directly discharged into rivers and streams where children swam. The FDA found that 87 percent of U.swordfish contained so much mercury that they were unfit for human consumption. Then the Clean Water Act was passed. We made incredible progress in the last 44 years. We still have a long way to go, as about one-third of our waterways are not yet fishable and swimmable, as the law requires.  Scott Pruitt's opposition to the Clean Water Act and EPA makes me terrified that we could go back to the bad old days of water pollution. EPA's enforcement of the Clean Air Act is an even bigger success story. This law has saved millions of lives and improved the health of millions of others. EPA's enforcement of the law has reduced air pollution by 70 percent since 1970. Smog levels in L.have fallen two-thirds since their peak. Lead in the air is down 98 percent, carbon monoxide down 85 percent, sulfur dioxide down 80 percent. Acid rain is down over 50 percent and at a fraction of the anticipated cost. But this progress is in real jeopardy.  As the Oklahoma attorney general and as the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, he dismantled the unit in his office charged with enforcing Federal environmental laws and stood up a unit to undermine Federal environmental law. He led the opposition to the Clean Power He sued the Federal Government over a dozen times to prevent the implementation of rules that would protect our health and our environment. What he does is fight the That is his thing.  As Oklahoma attorney general, he literally--I am not making this up--he literally copied and pasted a letter from a major oil company onto his official State attorney general letterhead and then sent it to the EPA as though it were his own.  I have never met Mr.Pruitt--and I assume he is personally a good guy--so I will say it like this: A person who works so closely with industries that[[Page S336]]pollute our air and water is an unusually bad fit to run the Never before in the history of the EPA has a President nominated someone so opposed to the EPA to run it, and on the most significant environmental challenge of our generation, he is aggressively wrong. He has said that the climate debate is ``far from settled'' and that ``scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connections to the actions of mankind.'' This, of course, is nuts. The climate debate is settled and has been for some time. More than 97 percent of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing and that humans are responsible. Ask a scientist, ask a farmer, ask a fisherman, ask a skier or snowboarder. If you don't believe 97 percent of scientists, will you at least believe your own eyes?  His position even puts him at odds with the Department of Defense, which has called climate change a ``threat multiplier.'' Here is the good news. We are actually making a lot of progress in clean energy, almost all of it in the private sector. The cost of solar power has dropped by 60 percent in the last 10 years and more new solar capacity was added in 2016 than any other energy source. Wind power was by far the largest source added to the grid in 2015. Clean energy generation grew by about 20 percent in the last year, and the long-term extensions of the renewable energy tax credits give us hope to think that kind of trajectory can be sustained. This comes at a time when public concern about climate change is at an alltime high, and with three-quarters of Americans, including half of Republicans, supporting Federal efforts to reduce carbon pollution.  This progress is fragile, and confirming Scott Pruitt can undermine our momentum. Again, here is Mr.Pruitt in his own words about the Clean Power Plan: ``The EPA does not possess the authority under the Clean Air Act to accomplish what it proposes in the unlawful Clean Power Plant.'' This is flat wrong.  Let me quickly explain a lawsuit called Massachusetts v. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate air pollution and carbon pollution as a pollutant so it is not only that the EPA may regulate greenhouse gas emissions, under the Clean Air Act they are actually required to do so. Mr.Pruitt has bragged that he ``led the charge with repeated notices and subsequent lawsuits against the U.Environmental Protection Agency.''  On climate change, he has said:       Is it truly manmade or is it just simply another period of      time when the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it      just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed [to]      what the administration says?  I cannot think of a person more ill-suited to run this  On clean energy, the Chinese are leading. Mexico is leading. Europe is leading, Germany, The question isn't whether the clean energy revolution will occur, the question is whether we will lead it or get left in the dust.  This is where we are. A nominee who does not understand the vital role of clean air, clean water, and protecting the environment has been nominated to lead the EPA, who denies decades of scientific research.  To my Republican colleagues, I have had many encouraging, rational conversations about climate with you but almost exclusively in private. I say this. This vote is the litmus test, the one your grandkids will ask you about. I know being in the Senate is about making choices--and lots of times it is great--but this issue, this vote is absolutely simple: Don't vote for a climate denier. You cannot dabble in conservation or energy efficiency or vote for a budget amendment recognizing the scientific consensus on climate change and then vote yes on this nominee. If you say you are not a climate denier, this is the point in your career when you get to prove it. If we find another nominee, even one who hates the Clean Power Plan, who shares your view on federalism, who shares your view about the United Nations, about President Obama, that is fair, that is fine, but this nominee is out of bounds.  Please, consult your voters, your university experts, talk to your kids. It is their planet. It is their future--or consult with your own conscience.  I know sometimes politics is complicated and the right thing to do is not that easy to determine in the fog of the battle. This is not one of those times. For future generations, for the planet, for the future of the Republican Party, you have to get this one right. If you are not a climate denier, do not put one in charge of the Environmental Protection  I yield the floor.

I understand the pull of party loyalty. I understand deference to a new But from what we have seen in the first 2 weeks of this administration, party loyalty is demanding too much of my Republican colleagues on several issues. On the matter of the Cabinet, on the matter of the President's Executive order on immigration, and on the matter of dealing with Russia, we need Republicans to set aside partisan considerations in favor of doing what is best for the country; otherwise, our institutions of government, our Constitution, and our core American ideals may be eroded.  My friends on the other side of the aisle are going along with the President and treating many of these things as if they are normal, but America knows they are not. We need Republicans to start recognizing it, saying it, and stepping up to the plate to do something about it.  I understand my Republican colleagues will go along with the President 90 percent of the time, but there are certain issues that are too important that demand putting country above party. Now is the time to put country above party.  First, on the Cabinet, our norms of good government and above all ethics are being tested by a Cabinet unlike any other I have seen in my time in public office. There are so many billionaires with so many conflicts of interest and so little expertise in the issues they would oversee.  Take the nomination we are now considering: Betsy DeVos for Education In my mind she is the least qualified nominee in a historically unqualified On conflicts of interest, she ranks among the worst. In her ethics agreement, which was delivered to the committee after the first hearing, it was revealed that she keeps interests in three family-owned trusts that have holdings in companies that could be affected by matters related to the Department of Independent ethics watchdogs have criticized her ethics agreement for failing to deal with these conflicts of interest.  On philosophy of education, her views are extreme. She seems to constantly demean the main purpose of her job--public education. Nine out of 10 American kids attend public schools. Her views on public education are a major concern, particularly for Senators from rural areas. There is not a lot of choice of schools outside major metropolitan areas. If you don't have a good public school in your neighborhood or in your community, you have nothing. Any Senator from a rural State should be worried about her commitment to public education.[[Page S686]]  We in New York have the third largest rural population in I am worried for those schools where, if the school is no good, you don't have much choice; you don't have any choice.

3581,topic-id,2579,"Mr.President, this past week, the American people have been exposed to a contentious debate here on the Senate floor about the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme  The American people have heard many arguments about the judge's merits and his shortcomings. They have also heard Senators litigate four decades of fierce partisan wrangling over the composition and direction of the Federal judiciary. That debate, that long debate, has informed the current one about Judge Newer Members may not remember all the details. Friends of mine, like Senator Hatch, probably remember too many of them. Still, the vote on Judge Gorsuch and the decision by the majority leader to move to change the rules has roped in all of that history.  Now, how did we get here? The truth is, over the long history of partisan combat over judicial nominations, there is blame on both sides. We believe that the blame should not be shared equally between Republicans and We believe the Republican Party has been the far more aggressive party in the escalation of tactics and in the selection of extreme judicial candidates, while Democrats have tended to select judges closer to the middle.  Keep this in mind: The last time a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic President was 1895. Nonetheless, each side comes here today in full confidence that their side is in the right. It was once said that ``antagonism is never worse than when it involves two men each of whom is convinced that he speaks for the goodness and rectitude.'' So it is today.  My Republican friends feel that they have cause to change the rules because the Democrats changed the rules on the lower court nominees in 2013. We believe we had to change the rules in 2013 because the Republicans ramped up the use of the filibuster to historic proportions, forcing more cloture votes under President Obama than during all other Presidents combined--more cloture votes under Obama than under George Washington all the way through to George  My Republican friends think they have cause to change the rules because we are about to deny cloture on the nomination of Judge We believe what Republicans did to Merrick Garland was worse than a filibuster, declaring mere hours after Justice Scalia's death that they would deny the constitutional prerogative of a President with 11 months left in his term. As my colleague from Illinois noted, we did not hear two words in the long speech of Senator McConnell: Merrick  We could relitigate these debates for the next hour, mentioning everything the Republican leader left out in his remarks. In fact, I am pretty sure we could argue endlessly about where, and with whom, this all started. Was it the Bork nomination or the obstruction of judges under President Clinton? Was it when Democrats blocked judges under President Bush or when Republicans blocked them under President Obama? Was it Judge Garland or Judge Gorsuch? Wherever we place the starting point of this long twilight battle over the judiciary, we are now at its end point.  These past few weeks, we Democrats have given Judge Gorsuch a fair process, something Merrick Garland was denied. My colleagues came into this debate with an open mind. I think many of them wanted to vote for Judge Gorsuch at the outset. So we met with the nominee. We consented to and participated in his hearing. But over the course of the hearing, during which Judge Gorsuch employed practiced evasions and judicial platitudes, the mood of our caucus shifted. Without so much as a hint about his judicial philosophy, without a substantive explanation of how he views crucial legal questions, all we had to go on was his record, and the more we learned about Judge Gorsuch's record, the more we didn't like.  Judge Gorsuch has shown in his rulings and in his writings to side almost instinctively with corporate interests over average He hasn't shown independence from the President, who so routinely challenges the legitimacy of the judiciary. While he has made a studious effort to portray himself as thoughtful and moderate, his record shows that, far from being the kind of mainstream candidate for the Supreme Court that could earn 60 votes, he may very well turn out to be[[Page S2388]]one of the most conservative Justices on the bench. An analysis of his record in the New York Times showed he would be the second most conservative Justice on the bench, and one in the Washington Post showed he would be the most conservative Justice, even to the right of Justice  For these principled reasons, Judge Gorsuch was unable to earn enough Democratic support for confirmation. Because of that, the majority is about to change the Standing Rules of the Senate to allow all Supreme Court nominees to pass on a majority vote.  It doesn't have to be this way. When a nominee doesn't get enough votes for confirmation, the answer is not to change the rules; it is to change the nominee. Presidents of both parties have done so in similar situations. On several occasions, Supreme Court nominees were withdrawn because they did not have enough support; one was even withdrawn after a failed cloture vote.  So this week we have endeavored to give the majority leader and my friends on the other side of the aisle a way out of this predicament. We offered them the option to sit down with us Democrats and the President and discuss a nominee who would earn enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate, not one vetted only by far-right special interest groups.  I came here to the floor each day and made an offer to meet anywhere, anytime to discuss a new nominee. I hoped, perhaps naively, that we could discuss a way forward that both our parties could live with. Unfortunately, there were no counteroffers or discussion offered by the other side. But our offer was meant sincerely.  Democrats and Republicans are caught in such a bunker mentality on this issue that we are just talking past each other. I know that many of my Republican friends are squeamish and uncomfortable with the path we are on, as we Democrats are as well. We have reached a point where the level of distrust is so high on this issue, we can't even sit down and talk.  My Republican friends dismiss out of hand the notion that Democrats will ever vote to confirm a Republican-nominated judge, despite the fact that there were Democratic votes for both Justices Roberts and Alito to get them over 60 and despite our plangent attempts to convince them otherwise. But make no mistake about it, for all the back and forth, when history weighs what happened, the responsibility for changing the rules will fall on the Republicans' and Leader McConnell's shoulders. They have had other choices; they have chosen this one. No one forced them to act; they acted with free will. We offered them alternatives; they refused. They hardly entertained any other possibilities. It seemed that the Republican leader was, from day one, intent on changing the rules if he didn't get his way.  Frankly, this is how so many of our Republican friends have approached the judiciary for a long time. For two decades, they have done whatever it has taken to move the bench to an ideological, far-right position. Independent experts have stated that we have a more conservative Supreme Court than we have had in a very long time. Nothing--not even the rules, not even the comity of the Senate--seems to stop them.  When the dust settles, make no mistake about it, it will have been the Republicans who changed the rules on the Supreme But we take no solace that history will put it on their shoulders because the consequences for the Senate and for the future of the Supreme Court will be far-reaching. The nuclear option means the end of a long history of consensus on Supreme Court nominations. It weakens the standing of the Senate as a whole as a check on the President's ability to shape the judiciary. In a postnuclear world, if the Senate and the Presidency are in the hands of the same party, there is no incentive to even speak to the Senate minority. That is a recipe for more conflict and bad blood between the parties, not less. The cooling saucer of the Senate will get considerably hotter.  The 60-vote threshold on controversial matters is a hallmark of the The majority leader has said so himself. It fosters compromise, it fosters bipartisanship, and it makes the Senate more deliberative. Sixty votes ought to be the epigraph of the Losing that standard on the Supreme Court, a hugely controversial matter, erodes the very nature of this body.  The 60-vote bar in the Senate is the guard rail of our democracy. When our body politics is veering too far to the right or to the left, the answer is not to dismantle the guardrails and go over the cliff but to turn the wheel back toward the middle. The answer is not to undo the guardrails--the rules--it is to steer back to the middle and get a more mainstream candidate.  With respect to the Supreme Court, the 60-vote threshold operates as a guardrail against judicial extremism. When 60 votes--typically a bipartisan supermajority--are required for confirmation, nominees tend to be in the judicial mainstream. The only nominee on the Court to be confirmed with less than 60 votes was Justice Thomas, who is widely recognized to be the most ideologically extreme Supreme Court It will mean the end of any pressure on any future President to nominate someone in the mainstream.  When it comes to the courts, the guardrails are being dismantled. There will be more 5-to-4 decisions, as our ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has pointed out. There will be less faith in the Supreme Court because it will be seen as a political body, an extension of our most divisive debates. As a result, America's faith in the integrity of the Court and the trust in the rule of law will suffer.  In conclusion, I am disheartened that we are here. In the sweep of history, the Senate has been the place where great, seemingly intractable disagreements in American politics finally give way to compromise, precisely because we have a set of rules that requires it. The story of the Senate is one of fierce debate but eventual cooperation. We tend to pull back when things get too heated because we all care about this institution and its role in our national life. In this case, the cumulative resentments from years of partisan trench warfare were too great. Instead of the Senate forcing us to change, Senators have decided to change the I worry a great deal about what that means for our future.  Twenty years ago, I think even the most partisan would say that the 60-vote threshold was basically inviolable. Today, it will be gone for all nominations, but at least not for legislation. My friend the majority leader has said he has no interest in removing the barrier for legislation.  I agree with him wholeheartedly, and I take him at his word.  I hope we can get together to do more in future months to ensure that the 60-vote threshold for legislation remains, but just as it seemed unthinkable only a few decades ago that we would change the rules for nominees, today's vote is a cautionary tale about how unbridled partisan escalation can ultimately overwhelm our basic inclination to work together and frustrate our efforts to pull back, blocking us from steering the ship of the Senate away from the rocks.  There is a reason it was dubbed the ``nuclear option.'' It is the most extreme measure, with the most extreme consequences. While I am sure we will continue to debate what got us here, I know that in 20 or 30 or 40 years, we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court; a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our Founders intended with these institutions, principles of bipartisanship and moderation and consensus.

3769,topic-id,296,"Mr.President, the second issue I would like to discuss is the travel ban, the recently issued Executive order on immigrants and refugees. Now that we have the details, it is clear that while the administration has made some very minor changes, it has done nothing to alter the core thrust of the order, which I believe is terribly misguided and does nothing to address the core concerns of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled the original order was potentially unconstitutional.  Moreover, we know that the administration delayed its announcement and implementation so President Trump could bask in the aftermath of his joint address. That should be all the proof Americans need to know that this Executive order has everything to do with optics and nothing to do with national security. If national security were at stake, it should not have been delayed a single day.  The truth is, there is very little new or improved about this Executive order. It is barely a fresh coat of paint on the same car that doesn't drive. It is still a travel ban. It is still a refugee ban. It still makes us less safe, not safer, according to not just me but to Republicans like Senator It still attempts to turn innocent immigrants and refugees into scapegoats and still does not do the things that would actually make us safer, like going after lone wolves and closing the loopholes in the Visa Waiver  The new Executive order is still mean-spirited, misguided, and, in my judgment, goes against what America is all about, being a country that accepts and cherishes immigrants, not disdains them. I fully expect the President's new Executive order will have the same uphill climb in the courts that the previous version had.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-06-pt1-PgS1591.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,6.0,March

3448,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this afternoon to oppose the nomination of Betsy DeVos, President Trump's choice to be Secretary of I fundamentally disagree with my colleague from Texas who said earlier that this is a fight about power and who maintains power, whether it is going to stay in Washington or whether it is going to be in our State and local communities.  In New Hampshire, we believe in local control of education. It is a bedrock principle of our public education system. This fight, today, is not about power in Washington versus power in the States; this is a fight about whether we are going to continue to support our public school system and our system of public higher education, or are we going to take the money out, the support out, and divert it into private and religious schools, and gut the public education system in this country?  My parents were part of the ``greatest generation,'' and they raised me in post-World War II They understood that the best way for my sisters and me to have opportunities for the future was to make sure we had a solid education. I benefited by going to great public schools in the State of Missouri and in the State of Pennsylvania, and I was also able to receive a quality public higher education. Without the opportunity to attend public universities in Pennsylvania and later in West Virginia and in the State of Mississippi, I would not have been able to get a college education because my parents wouldn't have been able to afford to send me to a private college or university, just like they wouldn't have been able to afford to send me to private K-12 schools.  I am grateful for the public schools I attended and proud of the support my parents and so many other parents have given to public schools across My children and grandchildren have benefited from the great public schools in New  As Governor, I was proud to work with the Republican legislature to improve the public schools in the State of New We expanded public kindergarten in our State because at the time I became Governor, we didn't have public kindergarten for all students. We were able to open the door for an additional 25,000 kids to go to public kindergarten. We were able to increase funding for schools in New Hampshire during my time as I learned during those experiences and also as a teacher--I taught in public schools in Dover, New Hampshire and also in Mississippi--the close connection between quality public education and a strong, growing economy.  I taught in Mississippi in 1970. At that time, there was no requirement for all young people to attend school. So if you didn't want to go to school, you didn't have to. We saw the negative impact that had on economic indicators in the State of Since then, the State has adopted compulsory education for students in But it was a great lesson to me to see how important good schools are and how they contribute to a strong economy in this country.  As Governor, when I talked to businesses in the State of New Hampshire, one of the things they told me that they needed in order for their businesses to succeed was a skilled workforce, young people who had a good education, who could learn advanced skills on the job. They looked to locate in communities where there was a strong system of public education.  I value public schools as one of our Nation's bedrock civic and democratic institutions because they provide the best opportunity for kids from all walks of life to get a quality education. They pass on to each new generation, including the children of immigrants, America's shared ideals and values.

3605,topic-id,905,"Mr.President, I wish to address the Senate for a few minutes about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, which is the topic of the day and has been the topic for weeks. It probably has been said, but I am going to go through some of it again.  Judge Gorsuch is a native of Denver, CO, where he currently resides with his[[Page S2399]]wife Louise and their two daughters. He is currently 49 years old.  I want to talk about some of his credentials. Judge Gorsuch received his bachelor of arts degree from Columbia University in 1988, his juris doctor from Harvard Law School in 1991, and a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford University in the UK in 2004.  At Columbia, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a Truman scholar at Harvard Law School, and a Marshall scholar at  Following law school, Judge Gorsuch served as a law clerk to Federal appellate judge David Sentelle and then to Justice Byron White of the U.Supreme Court and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme  In 1995, Judge Gorsuch entered private practice as an associate of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel, and he was elected partner in that law firm in 1998. His practice focused on general litigation in both trial and appellate matters.  Judge Gorsuch left private practice in 2005 to serve as the Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General at the Justice Department in  President George Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Denver, on May 10, 2006. He was confirmed in the Senate by a voice vote on July 20, 2006.  We talk about qualifications for judges. I want to share some of his. Judge Gorsuch has served over a decade on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth He has an outstanding judicial record that speaks for itself. He has participated in over 2,700 appeals on the Tenth Circuit, and 97 percent of them have been unanimously decided. In those cases, he was in the majority 99 percent of the time.  Of the approximately 800 opinions he authored on the Tenth Circuit, 98 percent of his opinions were unanimous, even on a circuit where 7 out of the 12 active judges were appointed by Democratic His opinions on the Tenth Circuit have the lowest rate of dissenting judges at 1.5 percent. That is unheard of. Out of the eight cases he has decided that were reviewed by the U.Supreme Court, seven were affirmed and one was vacated.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006 was met without opposition, and he was confirmed by voice vote.  Notably, Senators serving during this time include a lot of my former colleagues: then-Senator Barack Obama, Senator Joe Biden, Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator John Kerry, Senator Harry Reid, and 12 other current sitting Democratic Senators in this body, including the minority leader, Chuck  In March, the American Bar Association, ABA, unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch a ``well qualified'' rating, their highest possible mark. Minority Leader Schumer and Senator Leahy have both previously referred to the ABA as the ``gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''  In the area of jurisprudence, Judge Gorsuch has a mainstream judicial philosophy, which he clearly articulated during the Senate Judiciary's confirmation hearing.  I believe his record is unequivocal in that he believes judicial decisions should be based on the law and the Constitution and not personal policy preferences. He has a deep commitment to the Constitution and its protections established by our Founding Fathers, including the separation of powers, federalism, and the Bill of Judge Gorsuch's decisions demonstrate that he consistently applies the law as it is written, fairly and equally to all individuals.  Additional information about Judge Gorsuch: The American people deserve to have their voices heard in selecting Justice Scalia's replacement. This is what we are doing.  Some of my colleagues intend to oppose Judge Gorsuch based solely on the fact that they disagree with the outcome of the Presidential election.  During President Trump's campaign last year, he clearly defined the type of Justice he wished to nominate to the current vacancy. He even published, as you will recall, a list of 21 judges who possessed what he believed are the necessary qualifications to serve on the U.Supreme  Following Judge Gorsuch's nomination, he sat for over 20 hours of questioning in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the Senate--the longest hearing of any 21st-century nominee. Additionally, he was given 299 questions for the record by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This also is the most in recent Supreme Court confirmation history.  Simply put, I believe this is the most open and transparent process in choosing a Supreme Court nominee ever conducted by an administration. By filibustering this nomination, some of my colleagues are breaking a nearly 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple-majority vote.  I believe the American people spoke clearly when they elected President I believe this is the American people's seat, and I believe Judge Gorsuch is an exceptional choice for the Supreme He deserves an up-or-down vote, and that is why I believe we are getting ready in the next few hours to confirm him.

With the new administration of President Macri, I think that there will be a deepening relationship between the United States and Argentina, and this resolution recognizes that. It also encourages the Argentine Government to continue to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association, located then in the center of Buenos Aires, and the death of Argentine special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who died mysteriously 1 day before he was going to submit a report to the Argentine Congress regarding that 1994 bombing.  I think it is apparent that that 1994 bombing was conducted by Iran in cooperation with Hezbollah, and we all want to encourage the Argentine Government to find out whether there was foul play in the death of Alberto Nisman and, if so, who was behind what has all the hallmarks of an assassination designed to prevent that report from being submitted to the Argentine people and  I commend the authors of this legislation.

Unfortunately, the victims of these attacks and their families still lack answers to what really occurred, and the troubling reports of Iran's role in the bombing deserves thorough investigation that finally brings the perpetrators to justice.  Argentina is a great partner and a friend, and I believe we must continue to support our friends and continue to grow this critical relationship.

I thank my colleague very much.  Mr.President, I want to speak today about the nomination of Betsy Betsy DeVos's nomination is very personal to many people who live in Michigan because Betsy DeVos is from Michigan, and her vision of education and her actions have unfortunately played a major role in undermining our public schools.  Families all across our State can tell the story of her work with Michigan[[Page S708]]schools firsthand because they have seen it firsthand. They have lived it firsthand. They all say the same thing. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people who live in cities that are big and small, parents and teachers, principals, and community leaders from across the State--overwhelmingly, they have told me that Betsy DeVos should not be our next Secretary of  Everywhere I go, I can't believe how people will stop me about this and how strongly people feel in Michigan about this. They are saying this because, among other things, she has pushed for policies that have made charter schools in Michigan less accountable and has taken dollars away from public schools where the vast majority of children get their education. These are policies that have hurt our children and put their futures at risk.  I have received so many emails and phone calls from people involved every which way; at the grocery store, out at public events, people come up to me. I just want to share a couple of e-mails.  Chris is a teacher from Harper Woods and worked as a teacher in the Detroit public schools for over 20 years. He wrote: Betsy DeVos believes in school privatization and vouchers. She has worked to undermine efforts to regulate Michigan charters, even when they clearly fail. The marketplace solutions of DeVos will destroy our democratically governed community schools. Her hostility toward public education disqualifies her.  Those were Chris's comments.  In Michigan last year, State legislators put together a bipartisan plan, and our State legislature--House and Senate--majority is They put together a bipartisan plan to increase both funding and accountability for Detroit public schools.  There are a lot of wonderful things happening in Businesses are coming back to Detroit, and economic development is also, but we have major work to do for our children and their schools. So there was a huge bipartisan effort that came together to increase funding and accountability for the public schools, including charter schools. It was a commonsense proposal. Betsy DeVos led the effort to stop it, particularly the part that brought critically needed public accountability for for-profit and nonprofit charter schools.  Unfortunately, right now in Michigan we have a system where anyone can apply to open a charter school. There are no statewide standards for revoking the charter, and taxpayer money is sent to them with virtually no public disclosure requirement. For example, we have for-profit charter management companies that say they are private businesses; therefore, even though they are getting public money, they say they are private businesses, and they should not have to comply with a series of disclosure requirements regarding teachers and other information that, frankly, parents would want to know and taxpayers have a right to know.  Thirty-eight percent of charters in Michigan are at the bottom 25 percent of the schools in our When you look at the bottom one-fourth, 38 percent of the charters are in that category, and there is unfortunately very little accountability for their performance.  Sadly, precious taxpayer dollars have been taken away from public schools--neighborhood schools--to fund these charters. When it comes to funding for public schools, she will not commit to protecting the critical Federal dollars that serve our children.  One mom, Hillary Young from Detroit, came to Washington to watch the confirmation hearing on Betsy DeVos in the HELP She wrote to me. She said that she was not impressed and told a group of parents afterwards: As a parent I can't stand silently and watch other children be subject to similar circumstances to my child in My sixth grader was without a math teacher for over half the year last year because of funding reductions. The effect of DeVos's policies is not parents voting with their feet to go to better schools; it is children bearing the burden for fixing the education system they are supposed to be served by.  She goes on to say: DeVos's free market school choice system has left our city's education landscape in chaos, leaving less choice, less quality, and even more government bureaucracy.  We have seen parents get involved and speak out all across Michigan and, frankly, all across the country. I have received more mail, more emails, more phone calls on this nominee than any other, and I have received a lot on a lot of nominees, but there is a broad outcry.  People like Kathleen, who is a farmer and a grandmother from Farmington Hills, wrote to me: We have 15 grandchildren who are in the public school system, and we are terrified that there will be no more public schools and that the quality will be far inferior to charter and other private schools. I am writing you to respectfully ask that you do not vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of  I am deeply concerned about what we heard in committee about her views on special education. In the HELP Committee hearing last week, she suggested that States should decide on whether or not to enforce IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Act that has been such a landmark, opening doors of schools in every neighborhood across our country, for children with disabilities. This law was enacted in 1975, and makes sure that children with disabilities have the same educational opportunities as other children.  My nephew Barry, who has now gone through the special education system in Michigan, is a wonderful young man with Down syndrome. And I have seen personally how important that was for him, to be able to go on and be successful in the community as a part of the community. It is a very important civil right, frankly, for children with disabilities, as well as an essential part of our educational system.  Betsy DeVos, after her hearing, when she was asked about special education, followed up with a letter days later and wrote about expanding the conversation about school choice opportunities for parents of children with disabilities, but she didn't say anything about helping those in traditional public schools or helping students in the schools they are in now.  For me, this is not about politics or partisan messaging or even charters or private schools versus traditional public schools; it really is about what is best for our children and for our country. Families in Michigan and all across the country know this. Tens of thousands of people have called me over the last few weeks and sent emails and letters. Who we choose to be the Secretary of Education doesn't just affect the over 50 million children who attend public elementary and secondary schools, it affects the future of our country, and it is a fundamental difference in views. A competitive free market system, with winners and losers, works in the private marketplace. I support that. Business is open. They compete, and if they don't do well, they close, or they do very well and they go on and they grow. That is a strength in our country. But it doesn't work for educating our children because we can't afford losers. We can't afford losers when it comes to something as basic as fundamental education and creating opportunity for our children in the future. We need to provide every opportunity for every child to work hard and succeed.  I support having choices. I support magnet schools and public charters--I did that as a State Senator--as well as other choices that are great opportunities for children, if there are equal standards and public accountability for taxpayers' dollars so that parents can have confidence in that accountability, and if it is part of the public school system, the public process, and only if they are in addition to quality neighborhood schools in every neighborhood and in every ZIP It is not just a slogan to say it shouldn't matter where you live, what kind of opportunity you get or that your child has, and that is becoming more and more true. It certainly is in Michigan, where this philosophy has been a test case, and we are seeing it across the country. We can't afford losers. A winners-and-losers system is not good enough for our kids.  Betsy DeVos has a record of working against the vision of accountability and standards and choice within a system where every child has a quality neighborhood school in their neighborhood in every ZIP She has worked against that vision. She doesn't believe in it. We have fundamental differences in what will help our children[[Page S709]]for the future. That is why I will be voting no on her confirmation.  Thank you.

3603,topic-id,1089,"Mr.President, today we are one step closer to a vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme I look forward to the vote tomorrow. We will be confirming a Justice to the Supreme Court who is supremely qualified, who is a mainstream judge, who respects the rule of law and the Constitution, and who will rule impartially from the bench--someone who will call balls and strikes. That is what I believe the American people look for when they look for a Supreme Court  While it was always clear that some Democrats would oppose any Supreme Court candidate the President nominated, I had hoped that partisanship would be at least somewhat limited. I had hoped the Democrats would want to preserve the Senate's nearly 230-year tradition in confirming Supreme Court Justices by a simple-majority vote. And I had hoped that more than a handful of Democrats would join us to confirm one of the most, as I said, supremely qualified judges in my memory. That is not what happened. Despite Judge Gorsuch's qualifications, despite the support for his nomination from both liberals and conservatives, the vast majority of Senate Democrats were determined to block this confirmation.  Of course, it wasn't really ever about Judge It is not that Democrats were determined to block his confirmation; it is that they were determined to block any confirmation.  Democrats tried to offer reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, but they struggled to come up with anything plausible. The Senate minority leader actually came to the floor and tried to argue that he was worried that Judge Gorsuch would not be ``a mainstream justice.''  Over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been in the majority 99 percent of the time--99 percent. In 97 percent of those 2,700 cases, the opinions were unanimous. So I would love to hear an explanation for how exactly a judge who has been in the majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Was the minority leader attempting to argue that all of the judges on the Tenth Circuit, including those appointed by Democratic Presidents, are out of the mainstream?  The fact is that Democratic opposition to Judge Gorsuch had nothing to do with his qualifications. I doubt that any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really think that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of a Supreme Court Justice, but they opposed him anyway.  If they opposed a judge with a distinguished resume and a reputation as a brilliant jurist; if they opposed a judge who is known for his fairness and impartiality; if they opposed a judge whose nomination has been repeatedly supported by liberals, as well as conservatives; if they opposed a judge who unanimously received the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association--a rating, I might add, that the minority leader once called the ``gold standard'' for judicial nominees; if they opposed a judge a number of them supported 10 years ago, then it is abundantly clear that their opposition wasn't about this judge but about any judge this President nominates. Thus, Republicans were left with no real alternative but to act to preserve the Senate's tradition of giving Supreme Court nominees an up-or-down vote. This wasn't my preference. I preferred to leave room for a minority to block a judge who is truly not fit for office. But it was the only alternative we were left with if we wanted to confirm anyone to the Supreme  Historically, confirming judges was not a partisan process. During the George Bush administration, however, Democrats decided they were going to change that. They were mad back then too--mad that a Republican President was in charge. Apparently, modern-day Democrats are not reconciled to the fact that in our system of government, it is not always the Democrats who win.  Anyway, the Democrats were mad, and they decided that the historically bipartisan process of confirming judicial nominees was going to change. Their 2003 filibuster of Miguel Estrada, who had been nominated to a seat on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, was the first time a judicial nominee who enjoyed clear majority support was not confirmed because of a filibuster.  Democrats ultimately successfully filibustered no fewer than 10 Bush nominees to appellate courts. That was a massive reversal in Senate history. Suddenly the normally smooth process of confirming a President's judicial nominee had been turned into an exercise in partisanship.  Ten years later, Democrats struck again when they employed the nuclear option to ensure that they could pack the DC Circuit--despite the fact that at the time, when the current minority leader announced that Democrats would ``fill up the D.Circuit one way or the other,'' Republicans had blocked just two of President Obama's circuit nominees and had confirmed 99 percent of his judges. So 215 were confirmed out of 217 under President Obama up to that point.  And now here we are today. Democrats are again mad that they lost an election, that they can't control the nomination process, and they once again turned to ``no-holds-barred'' partisanship. They made it clear that no Republican nominee would ever make it to the Supreme Court; thus, we had to act to ensure that Supreme Court nominees can receive an up-or-down vote going forward.  In the Senate's nearly 230 years, the filibuster has been used to block a Supreme Court nominee exactly once--one time. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas's nomination to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was blocked by a bipartisan coalition, in part over ethical concerns. That is how strong the Senate's bipartisan tradition of an up-or-down vote on Supreme Court nominees has been--230 years, one time, and it was bipartisan. I am deeply sorry that the Democrats were determined to end that tradition.  Judge Gorsuch should never have faced the threat of a filibuster. There was no reason--no reason other than the most flagrant partisan politics--to block this supremely qualified nominee from the Supreme  As I said, I look forward to tomorrow and to this final vote where we will have an opportunity to confirm to the Supreme Court this well-qualified, mainstream nominee who fundamentally respects the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States and will act impartially as a Justice for the American people.

3736,topic-id,1062,"Mr.President, the internet has grown at an unbounded rate in the years since its inception, a phenomenon no one can argue with. Much of that growth can be attributed to the light-touch regulatory approach that the government adopted in the early days of the web.  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the internet, I have worked hard to promote policies that encourage the private sector to invest in and grow the internet ecosystem as a whole. All of that is jeopardized, however, if government bureaucrats have the ability to overregulate the digital world. When it comes to overregulating the internet, one need look no further than the Democratic-controlled Federal Communications Commission under President  In a world that was turning away--it was literally turning away from the legacy telecommunication services and, instead, toward dynamic internet applications, the FCC found its role gradually diminishing. This is an inevitable and good byproduct, I might add, of a more competitive environment brought about by technological innovation and successful light-touch policies.  Yet the Obama FCC fought hard against this technological progress and, instead, pursued an aggressively activist and partisan agenda that put government edicts ahead of real consumer desires. Over the last 2 years, the FCC has made a stunning bureaucratic power grab. First, the FCC stripped away the Federal Trade Commission's authority to police internet providers and seized that for itself by recharacterizing such services as monopoly-era telecommunications.  Then in 2016, the FCC, which has little experience regulating internet privacy, decided to turn our country's privacy laws on their head by abandoning the time-tested enforcement approach of the FTC, the Federal Trade These actions by the FCC ignored both common sense and real world data and, instead, focused on hypothetical harms of the future.  Ignoring years of internet ecosystem precedent, where everyone was treated the same, the FCC's 2016 broadband privacy regulations would apply only to certain parts of the internet. This is a source of significant concern because at any particular time, consumers will not have reasonable certainty of what the rules are and how their privacy decisions will be applied.  Are you at home on Wi-Fi? At home on a smartphone? Using your smartphone on a friend's Wi-Fi? Using the Internet at a library? Each of these could have very different privacy implications for a consumer because of the FCC's piecemeal approach to privacy, leading to more confusion and uncertainty, not increased privacy protections, as promised.  In enacting these lopsided rules, the FCC seems to have gone out of its way to disregard established FTC practice by creating new regulations that differ significantly from the FTC's tried-and-true framework. The FTC's privacy regime is clear, easy to understand, and applies evenly throughout the marketplace. By contrast, the FCC's rules are complex, confusing, and often lead to the same data being treated inconsistently online.  The FCC's action would harm consumers in other ways as well. Even though no consumer wants to be in the dark about newer and cheaper services, the FCC's rules actually make it more difficult for customers to hear about new, innovative offerings from their broadband providers. And because the FCC imposed heavy-handed data requirements on these internet companies, they will have less ability to offer services that are tailored to their customers' needs and interests. Furthermore, the FCC unfairly distorted the marketplace when it imposed unnecessarily onerous privacy restrictions on broadband providers while leaving the rest of the internet under the strong and successful regime at the  When speaking about the economic opportunities the internet now affords us, President Obama's last FCC chairman declared that ``government is where we will work this out.''  ``Government is where we will work this out.''  Well, I couldn't disagree more. I believe the marketplace should be the center of the debate over how our digital networks would function, not the I believe consumers and job creators should be the ones deciding about new technologies, not the government.  The resolution before us today is the first step toward restoring regulatory balance to the internet ecosystem. The best way for that balance to be achieved is for there to be a single, uniform set of privacy rules for the internet--the entire internet--rules that appropriately weigh the need to protect consumers with the need to foster economic growth and continued online innovation.  The FCC is simply the wrong venue for that effort. Its statutory scope is too narrow, and it lacks institutional expertise on privacy. The current chairmen of the FCC and the FTC both recognize this, having jointly called for returning jurisdiction over broadband providers' privacy and data security practices to the FTC ``so that all entities in the online space can be subject to the same rules.''  For those reasons, I support the resolution before us that would provide congressional disapproval of the Obama administration's misguided and unfair attempts to regulate the internet, and I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution as well.  To those people who have heard that this resolution somehow results in the elimination of all online protections for consumers, I can assure you those[[Page S1929]]claims are simply unfounded scaremongering. If this resolution is enacted, it will repeal only a specific rulemaking at the FCC that has yet to be implemented. What we are talking about here hasn't even been implemented yet. It will not touch the FCC's underlying statutory authority. Indeed, the FCC will still be obligated to police the privacy practices of broadband providers, as provided for in the Communications The new chairman of the FCC confirmed this when he appeared before the Commerce Committee earlier this month. No matter what happens with this resolution, the FTC will continue to have its authority to police the rest of the online world.  It is my hope that once the Senate passes this resolution, the House will move quickly to take it up and send it to the President for his signature because, before our country can get back on the right track, we must first move past the damaging regulations adopted in the waning days of the Obama administration.  I thank Senator Flake for his leadership on this issue. Without his tireless efforts, we would not be here today, standing ready to move decisively toward a better future for the internet.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that we will vote on tomorrow at noon.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgS1925-2.txt,1534,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,22.0,January

Her only knowledge of student loans seems to come from her own financial investments connected to debt collectors who hound people struggling with student loans. Despite being a billionaire, she wants the chance to keep making money off[[Page S696]]shady investments while she runs the Department of We need someone in charge of the Nation's education policy who knows what they are doing and who will put America's young people first, and that is not Betsy  Let's start with her record. Betsy DeVos has used her vast fortune to undermine Michigan's public schools. She is sure she knows what is best for everyone else's children, even though she has no actual experience with public schools.  In Michigan, the K-12 policy she has bankrolled has drained valuable taxpayer dollars out of the public schools and shunted that money into private schools, sketchy online schools, and for-profit charter schools. Even worse, DeVos believes these schools should get the money with virtually no accountability for what these schools do with taxpayer dollars. The results have been a disaster for Michigan kids.  Let's be perfectly clear. This is not a debate about school choice. It is not a debate about charter schools. There are people on all sides of this debate who are genuinely pouring their hearts into improving educational outcomes for children. Massachusetts charter schools are among the very best in the country, and they understand the difference.  Before her nomination hearing, I received an extraordinary letter from the Massachusetts Charter Public School The letter outlines their opposition to Betsy DeVos's nomination, citing her destructive record of promoting for-profit charter schools without strong oversight for how those schools serve students and families.  People who work hard to build good charter schools with high accountability are offended by the DeVos nomination. This abysmal record is troubling because the Secretary of Education is responsible for safeguarding the investments that the Federal Government makes in public schools and for holding States accountable for delivering a good education for all their students, especially those who need the help the most.  The Secretary is also responsible for enforcing critical civil rights laws, like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, but Betsy DeVos's confirmation hearing demonstrated to the entire world she is embarrassingly unprepared to enforce these laws.  Her apparent unfamiliarity with these critical civil rights laws has terrified families who have children with special needs, terrified families in Massachusetts and all across the country. These parents are afraid we could have an Education Secretary who doesn't even have a basic understanding of the Federal laws that guarantee their kids a chance to receive a public school education.  We still have a long way to go to make sure all kids in this country have a shot at a decent education, particularly children living in poverty, children of color, children with disabilities, and children who are immigrants or refugees. That is why the Federal Government got involved in education in the first place, to make certain that all of our children, not just some of them but that all of our children get a chance at a first-rate education.  Public education dollars should come with some basic accountability for how that money is spent and some basic expectations about what we get in return for these investments, not just doled out to some for-profit school that doesn't even meet basic standards in educating our children. This is also true in higher education, where the financial stakes are huge for America's college students.  The Department of Education is in charge of making sure that the $150 billion that American taxpayers invest in students each year through grants and loans gets into the right hands and that students get an education that will help them pay back their loans.  The student aid program is not well understood, but it is vitally important to get it right because $1 trillion of student loan debt currently out there will impact the future of an entire generation.  Betsy DeVos has no experience in higher education. During her confirmation hearing, I gave her the opportunity to show that she is at least serious about standing up for students. I asked her basic, straightforward questions about her commitment to protecting students and taxpayers from fraud by these shady for-profit colleges. Her response was shocking. She refused to commit to use the Department's many tools and resources to keep students from getting cheated when fraudulent colleges break the law.  In her responses to my written questions, she even refused to commit to doing what the law requires by canceling the loans of students who have been cheated by lawbreaking colleges. An Education Secretary who is unwilling to cut off Federal aid to colleges that break the law and cheat students would be a disaster for both students and taxpayers. Betsy DeVos's refusal to guarantee debt relief for defrauded students could leave thousands of Americans saddled with student loan debt that by law they are not required to pay.  Betsy DeVos also refused to rule out privatizing the Direct Loan Think about this. As if our students don't have enough problems already, DeVos is ready to let Wall Street banks get their claws into our students and start charging extra profits on top of the already high cost of student loans.  If Betsy DeVos won't commit to strengthening the Federal student loan program and running it for students, then she is absolutely unfit to be in charge of it.  I am also deeply concerned about the conflicts of interest and potential government corruption if Betsy DeVos is allowed to take the reins of the Department of Betsy DeVos is a multibillionaire, and that is fine, but for her, that is apparently not enough. She already makes money off of several businesses that could profit from decisions she makes as Secretary of Education--several businesses, at least, that we know about. She said she will get rid of the ones we know about, but she wants to keep her family trusts and whatever investments two of them hold a secret--a secret from Congress and a secret from U.taxpayers. She says she doesn't have to follow rules that everyone else follows and tell the Senate what her investments are or what they will be in those secret trusts. I want you to think about that for just a minute. She already has billions of dollars, but she won't give up her secret trust and her chance to make investments that could create conflicts of interest while she is running the Department of Education? Who exactly does Betsy DeVos want to help out--the young people of America or her own bank account?  You know, I really don't get this. I disagree with her education policy, but the one thing we ought to be able to agree on is that no one, especially not some billionaire, ought to keep investments that go up or down in value depending on the decisions she makes while she has a job working for the U.Because of that concern, I wrote a letter with several of my Democratic colleagues to raise concerns about her potential conflicts that aren't clearly resolved by her public ethics agreement. We asked her some simple questions about the lack of financial transparency and the shady investments she plans to keep while she has a government job. What did we get back? She thought our basic questions about ethics weren't even worth an answer. That stinks. This whole process stinks.  At every step along the way, the Republicans have made it clear that no matter her inexperience, no matter her radical views, no matter her potential conflicts of interest, no matter her secrecy, no matter her blowing off basic anti-corruption practices, they will ram this nomination down the throats of the American people sideways. Here are just a few egregious examples.  First, committee Democrats were allotted 5 minutes--5 minutes total--during her hearing to question Betsy DeVos on her troubling record. Republicans suddenly invented a new rule that we couldn't ask additional questions. This is an important job. I asked President Obama's Secretary of Education multiple rounds of questions, and he had led a public education system in the past, but I guess when a Republican nominee and megadonor is in line to run education policy, we are supposed to fall in line and keep quiet.  Second, breaking with standard practice and what we did for President Obama's Education nominees, we were[[Page S697]]forced to hold Betsy DeVos's hearing before the ethics review of her billions was completed. The complicated ethics review raised a ton of additional questions, but we got absolutely no chance to question her about it.  Third, Betsy DeVos is the first nominee ever to go through the HELP Committee who has flat-out refused to fully disclose her financial holdings. She will be the first nominee in recent history to hold secret trusts. She was supposed to complete a form that requires nominees to list in detail all of their assets, investments, and gifts so that the committee has a full understanding of the nominees' potential conflicts of interest. No, she wants to keep many of her holdings in a family trust a secret, so she just won't tell.  Fourth, Republicans ignored and overrode the rules of the Senate in order to barely squeeze the DeVos nomination out of committee as quickly as possible. And now, with at least 50 Senators--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--publicly opposed to this nomination, the Republican leadership has rigged the vote so that Senator Sessions can drag her across the finish line just before he is confirmed as Attorney Why is Senator Sessions even voting on this nomination? It is a massive conflict of interest. As the AG, Sessions will be responsible for enforcing the law against DeVos if her cesspool of unresolved financial conflicts results in illegal behavior, but apparently the Republicans just don't care.  Let's face it: The Republican leadership wants DeVos, and they are willing to ignore her hostility to public schools, willing to ignore her indifference to laws that protect special needs kids, willing to ignore the giant ethical cloud that hangs over her--ignore it all so that billionaire and Republican campaign contributor Betsy DeVos can be Secretary of The American people can see what is happening here.  I commend my Republican colleagues, Senators Collins and Murkowski, for standing up for what is right and saying they will vote against Betsy DeVos's nomination on the floor. I know how difficult it can be to stand up for what is right even under overwhelming pressure from your own team to just keep your head down and go with the flow. They have been listening to the teachers and parents in their States, and I deeply respect their principled opposition to this nomination.  I have also heard from thousands of teachers, parents, and education leaders in Massachusetts raising deep concern about Betsy DeVos's nomination. I hear their concern, and I share their concern.  You know, this isn't just politics, this is deeply personal. It is personal for me. My first job out of college was as a teacher. I taught little ones, children with special needs, in a public elementary school. I have never lost my appreciation for the importance of strong public education because I have seen how public education opened a million doors for me, and I know it opens doors for young people in Massachusetts and all across this country. I believe that strengthening America's public schools is critical for securing a better future for our children and for our grandchildren. I also understand the vital role the Secretary of Education plays in making sure every young person has real opportunities and a fighting chance to succeed.  We are one vote away from making sure this job is not entrusted to Betsy One vote. We need just one more Republican to stand up for the children of America, to stand up for public education, to stand up for college students, to stand up for basic decency and honesty in government. With just one more Republican, we can say this Senate puts kids ahead of partisan politics. With just one more Republican, we can say this Senate still cares about public officials who put the public ahead of their own interests. Just one more Republican, that is all we need. Just one.  I assumed that the rush to complete this nomination has something to do with the fact that Republicans' phones have been ringing off the hook from citizens who are outraged by the idea of this nomination. Before these Republicans decide whether to help Donald Trump reward a wealthy donor by putting someone in charge of the Department of Education who doesn't really believe in public education, I want them to hear from the people of Massachusetts, the people who on their own have contacted me about this nomination.  I have received countless letters and calls from constituents in Massachusetts, including a batch of letters from a new local grassroots organization--Essex County #6 Indivisible--that is very concerned that Betsy DeVos is a danger to our schools. So I just want to share a few of those letters with my colleagues right now.  I heard from Matt Harden, who is a teacher from Plymouth, and he wrote this:       I have been a teacher for fifteen years and a parent for      seven. I feel incredibly proud of the schools in the      Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and view my position as a      music educator not simply as a job but a vocation. The recent      referendum in the Commonwealth regarding the expansion of cap      on Charter Schools was soundly defeated by the electorate.

3620,topic-id,1889,"Mr.President, I rise to express my strong support for Judge Neil Gorsuch, to say that I will proudly vote in favor of his confirmation tomorrow, and to express my confidence that history will judge this nominee to be an outstanding Associate Justice of the Supreme I hope he serves a long and distinguished career and believe he will. I think Justice Neil Gorsuch will turn out to be a credit to the Supreme Court, to the President who nominated him, and to the Senate that will confirm him tomorrow.  It is unfortunate that we have had quite a bit of discussion about procedure and the process that has gotten us to this vote, which will take place tomorrow afternoon.  I had a conversation with one of my Democratic colleagues yesterday afternoon as we were leaving the Capitol This is a person with whom I have worked on issues and for whom I have great regard. I asked him how he was doing, and he said: Well, I am just getting ready for the United States Senate to be forever changed.  I paused for a moment, and I said: How can it be that two reasonably intelligent Senators of good will can look at the same factual situation and see it so differently? I think my colleague did agree that, indeed, the situation we have is what has led us to our proceedings today.  I do believe my colleagues on the other side of the procedural issues today are people of good will who are trying to do the right thing by their country on this issue, just as I have been.  Let's look first of all at the candidate himself, and then I might take a moment or two to talk about what we have already done. That decision has been made. Let's talk about Neil Gorsuch, about this outstanding future Supreme Court Justice who I believe will be sworn in tomorrow or the next day.  Is Neil Gorsuch qualified? Really, can anyone contest that he is highly qualified? He is perhaps one of the most qualified people ever to have been nominated by a President for the High He has degrees from Columbia, Harvard Law, and Oxford He has received the American Bar Association's highest rating, the gold standard that we look at when it comes to judging nominees for the Federal bench up to and including the High He served for 10 years with distinction on the Tenth Circuit Court of Clearly, he has got the qualifications, and clearly, he is among that group of qualified individuals that the President promised to look at back during the campaign and promised to send that type of individual over to the Supreme I really don't think there is much that can be said to contradict the fact that Neil Gorsuch is qualified and highly qualified.  So now let's ask if Neil Gorsuch is somehow out of the broad judicial mainstream. Again, I think it is clear that, based on his history, based on his testimony, and based on his rulings up until now, he is part of the broad judicial mainstream that will put him in good company on the Supreme Court and makes him a worthy successor to Justice  First of all, he has earned the praise of both conservatives and liberals. He has even won the endorsement of President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General, who wrote in the New York Times, ``If the Senate is to confirm anyone, Judge Gorsuch who sits on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver should be at the top of the list.'' So thank you to the[[Page S2409]]former Acting Solicitor General for going beyond ideology and political philosophy and saying a true statement that Judge Gorsuch is outstanding and should be at the top of the list.  Editorial boards across the country have touted Judge Gorsuch's credentials and temperament. The Denver Post, his hometown newspaper, wrote an editorial praising his ability to apply the law fairly and consistently. Of course, there has been newspaper after newspaper from the right and left across this country who come down on this side of the issue saying that Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed.  Let's look also--and this has been pointed out so often that you wonder if you should say it again, but Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit has participated in 2,700 cases, he has written over 800 opinions, and has been overruled by the Supreme Court one time. Is this a judicial radical? I think not.  I think this is someone who is demonstrated to be in the judicial mainstream--one reversal by the Supreme Court out of 800 written decisions and 2,700 votes cast on panels with the Tenth He has almost always been in the majority some 99 percent of the panels he served on, he was in the majority of those opinions, and 97 percent of those decisions were unanimous. This is hardly some radical pick as some might have suggested.  Has the process been unfair? We have heard a lot about this. A lot of my dear friends on the other side of the aisle feel aggrieved for sure. They feel that Judge Garland, the nominee of President Obama in 2016, was treated unfairly. I would simply make this observation, and the American public can decide if this was unfair.  This is a vacancy that came up during a heated, hotly contested Presidential year. There is really no doubt that, under similar circumstances, had the roles been reversed and had a Republican tried to nominate a nominee in the last year of his 8-year term, that a Democrat majority in the Senate would have done exactly as we did.  I am not guessing when I say this because the Democratic leaders of previous years have said as much. No less than Joe Biden--who was a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee and later on became Vice President for 8 years--no less than Joe Biden said exactly the same. It almost became the Biden rule. Republican Presidential nominees taken up during the final year of a term will not be considered by a Democratic So the shoe was on the other foot, and we acted the same.  So we will leave it up to the American people to decide whether Judge Garland was treated unfairly. I do not believe he was. As a matter of fact, I felt very comfortable during 2016 saying that who fills a Supreme Court seat is so important, such a significant and long-lasting decision, that the American people deserve to be heard on this issue. I felt comfortable making the Presidential election largely about what the Supreme Court would look like over the coming years.  There is no question about it, the American people got to decide in November of 2016 whether they would like a judge in the mold of Justice Scalia whose seat we were trying to fill or would they like a judge in the mold of Judge Garland who President Obama was seeking to put in place. So I make no apology for saying to the American people, You get to decide in this Presidential year what sort of Supreme Court you want. The American people made that decision, and I am comfortable with that.  I was asked today by several members of the press about the change in the rules that I voted for today. It is not a situation that makes me overly joyed. It is not my idea of a good time to overrule a precedent and to substitute another one in its place. You would rather not do that if you are a U.Senator; but the fact is that it puts us back into a place that we were for 200 years in this  From the beginning of this Senate, 1789 through 1889, through 1989, up to and including 2003, there was no filibuster at all on Supreme Court There was no partisan filibuster at all in Supreme Court Justices, and no judge had ever been denied his position because of a partisan filibuster at any level--Federal judge, circuit level, or Supreme  That changed in 2003, and with the Miguel Estrada nomination, our Democrat friends stopped a qualified judge from going on the Federal appeals court. That was the beginning of an unfortunate 14-year experiment in judicial filibusters. It is not a filibuster that I think--it is not a precedent or experiment that I think this Senate can be very proud of, but it took place over a relatively short period of time over 14 years, and it ends it today.  As of today, the U.Senate is back where it was for over 200 years in the history of this Senate and the history of our Republic without the ability to stop a judge on a partisan filibuster. In fact, this fact cannot be contradicted. There has never been in the history of our country, even in this past decade and a half of having the possibilities of a Supreme Court filibuster, there has never been a Supreme Court nominee in the history of our republic stopped by a partisan filibuster.  Today that 225-year or so precedent would have ended had we not acted to change the rules back to where we are back to fundamental principles. I was not willing to see Judge Neil Gorsuch be that first nominee stopped by a partisan filibuster in the history of our country. I was simply not willing to do that.  We now must proceed to the rest of our business. We will confirm Judge Gorsuch tomorrow. I think he will serve well. Then we have work to do. We have other nominees to consider, and then we've got an agenda that we need to tend to for our people.  I am encouraged by the exchange of the first early steps of goodwill after this divisive process. Indeed, there was an article in one of our publications today that talked about a healthy feeling now in both caucuses, that we have got to put this procedural episode behind us, this crisis behind us and legislate.  I am glad to hear that sort of bipartisan talk coming from the other side of the aisle. Another of my friends across the aisle said, ``We're not looking for dilatory procedures,'' he said. ``When there are things where we can work together, we're looking for that.''  I am encouraged--even encouraged that my friend who I was talking to yesterday afternoon will conclude that we have not forever changed the Senate in a negative way, that we are, in fact, back to where we were before 2003 and getting things done.  In the end, this is about an individual who is qualified. It is about a vacancy that needs to be filled. I for one am highly comfortable that the President, in Neil Gorsuch, has put forth an outstanding, eminently qualified judge and that he will serve us well. My vote tomorrow in favor of confirmation will be cast enthusiastically and proudly, and I think that it will stand the test of time.  I thank the Presiding Officer very much, and at this time, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

3537,topic-id,569,"Mr.President, most of us have heard the metaphor that small businesses are the engines that power our economy. What we don't hear people talk about as much is the fuel that feeds the engines: capital. Without capital, entrepreneurs cannot see their ideas to fruition, successful business owners cannot expand to meet the needs of the market, and eager job seekers must take their skills elsewhere. Without capital, Main Street falters, and Wall Street keeps the advantage.  Today, more than 9 years after the start of the great recession and many policy reforms later, access to capital remains a challenge. This capital drought hampers small business growth, economic development, and job creation in Oregon and across the country. Despite this, government regulation continues to tie the hands of many willing small businesses lenders--namely, credit unions. According to some estimates, credit unions could lend an additional $11 billion to small businesses if Congress loosened restraints on credit union business lending.  With this in mind, I am pleased to introduce today the Credit Union Residential Loan Parity Act with Senator This bill would increase access to capital by exempting certain loans from the member business lending cap imposed on credit unions. Currently, loans made for one- to four- person, non-owner-occupied housing are treated as business loans when they are made by credit unions. As such, these types of loans count against a credit union's business lending cap, effectively limiting a credit union's ability to provide loans to small businesses. Our legislation would address this issue by allowing credit unions to treat these types of loans as residential loans--the same treatment these kinds of loans receive when made by other financial institutions. In effect, the bill would exempt residential loans from the business lending cap. This exemption would increase access to capital for small businesses, which in turn would create jobs and grow our local economies. In addition to generally increasing credit union lending, our legislation would directly free up capital for small businesses that make much needed investments in rental housing.  I am hopeful that this legislation will be received by colleagues for what it is--a simple step to help ensure America's small businesses have access to the fuel they need to power our economy.  It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 836       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

3601,topic-id,3357,"Mr.President, I don't wish to turn this into a bouquet-tossing process, but I think it is very clear that Senators on both sides of the aisle are very, very pleased to see our friend[[Page S2395]]from Georgia back today. We are wishing him health and We look forward to his full and complete recovery. We are so glad to have him here.

It is no secret that he has tried repeatedly to bring both sides together, and he and I have talked often about this. I think there are going to be opportunities for finding common ground on important legislation, breaking out of this gridlock that we all understand is not what the Senate is all about and forging toward more mainstream topics. When we get there, to a great extent, it will be because of the thoughtful comments of my friend from  Mr.President, the Senate is going to act on one of its most sacred and important constitutional duties, the advice and consent on the nomination of the next Associate Justice of the Supreme  The long tails of these Supreme Court debates stretch through generations and shape our government deep into the future. The choice the Senate makes in this extraordinary debate will have a profound impact, from the broadest governing statutes down to the most specific particulars of the law that affect our daily lives.  There are several issues that are particularly relevant to this nominee that have gotten short shrift. I am talking about secret law, and warrantless wiretapping, death with dignity. I intend to discuss these issues shortly.  I would like to begin, however, by stating that whether one supports or opposes Judge Gorsuch, our job would have been easier had the judge been more forthcoming in his testimony before the Judiciary He chose, however, not to do so. So what the Senate has to go by instead is the judge's lengthy record of adhering to a rigid and far-right philosophy that is packaged in the branding of so-called originalism.  The originalist says that our rights as a people are contained within and linked to our founding documents. But that viewpoint is plainly incorrect. In practice, originalism becomes a cover for protecting the fortunate over the poor, corporations over individuals, and the powerful over virtually every other It is a political agenda that masquerades as philosophy, an agenda whose sole intent is reserving power for those in power and limiting the recognition of the rights reserved to the people.  Far from endorsing such a creed, our Constitution is actually a document of constraints, constraints that bind the government, not the people. The full scope of our fundamental rights as a people, as Justice Harlan once wrote, ``cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution.'' The exact concept is written into the Bill of Rights itself. The Ninth Amendment says: ``The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.''  James Madison, the founder so significant that Americans are said to live in a ``Madisonian Democracy,'' was outspoken about the dangers of future readers or interpreters thinking that the fundamental rights contemplated by the Framers were limited to the Constitution or Bill of  So our founding document and its Framers made clear that rights were not enumerated by the Constitution; they were retained by the people. Individual liberties, from personal privacy to a woman's right to vote, the choice of contraception and abortion, interracial marriage, same-sex marriage, equal protection of the law--these liberties and, let me emphasize, many, many, many more have always existed. In fact, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were silent on much of what Americans consider fundamental to a free people. That silence left the door open for the courts, as we shed the prejudices of a darker age, to recognize the true meaning of the words ``all men are created equal'' and ``inalienable rights.''  The process has been painfully slow. The Constitution, like any document composed by politicians, is fraught with original sin. For example, the three-fifths compromise was a shameful device of political accommodation. Through long stretches of our history, political agendas have left many individual rights unrecognized or unprotected by the courts. They ruled in favor of the powerful and against the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised, often with the justification that their rulings adhered to the text of the  Nowhere did the Constitution expressly deny women the right to vote, but the Supreme Court ruled against Virginia Minor in 1875. The Federal Government was not expressly granted a right to intern residents of Japanese descent, but the Supreme Court allowed it in There was no constitutional basis on which to deny people of different ethnicities the right to marry. On those issues and more, our judges were wrong. Supreme Court Justices were wrong. In the service of the economic, political, and religious powers that be, the Court has defended slaveholders, denied the franchise, permitted racial, sexual, and other discrimination, and routinely--routinely--elevated the power of the State over individual liberties. Any defense of those rulings as adhering to the text of the Constitution is just plain wrong.  Let's look more closely at women's voting rights. In Minor v. Happersett, the Supreme Court found that women did not have the right to vote because that right was not expressly stated anywhere in the In a unanimous decision, the Court took the absurd position that a document predicated on voting, organized by voting, and dependent on voting for any amendment, still did not protect the right to vote for all citizens. Such is the intellectual bankruptcy of a long legal tradition sustained by its defense of the status quo.  The 19th Amendment was a response to the abridgement of a fundamental right by political parties and their dependent courts, but it did not create a new right. It was a long overdue fix made necessary by an originalist court.  If there is a national evolution that extends protection of rights and liberties to disenfranchised and oppressed people, it is because with time, our wonderful country tends to correct its wrongs. It did so with a Civil War and the amendments that followed. It did so with women's suffrage and the Brown decision. It did so more recently with the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Historically, our country has gradually recognized fundamental rights and liberties.  ``Recognition''--I use that word intentionally. It is recognition because there are no new rights, per se. They are inalienable, and those rights are not limited to those spelled out in the A jurist governed by that principle would respect individual rights, but that simply isn't the viewpoint taken by many so-called originalists on the far right today.  The rightwing originalism looks, in my view, a lot more like the judicial philosophy that trampled on the rights of Americans in days past--a philosophy that throughout our history has left many Americans marginalized, disenfranchised, and oppressed by the  Unfortunately, after listening very carefully to Judge Gorsuch present his views and after reviewing his writings, including some I will mention that specifically talk about my home State, I have no faith that Judge Gorsuch would be any different from this philosophy that I mentioned that has left so many Americans marginalized in our country.  Judge Gorsuch not only has a long record of conservative activism in the courtroom, but he has demonstrated an out-and-out hostility toward the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives and their own families without interference from the In one troubling instance, he went so far as to author a book attacking death with dignity. This of course has been a matter that historically has been left to the States, and the people of my State twice approved death-with-dignity ballot measures and our death-with-dignity laws have been in place for nearly 20 years. The Supreme Court upheld it more than a decade ago in a case known as Gonzalez v. But[[Page S2396]]Judge Gorsuch's record and his own words put the will of millions of Oregonians in question.  Nothing in the Constitution gives the Federal Government the power to deny suffering Oregonians the right to make basic choices about the end of their lives. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the Federal Government a power to deny people in my State the right to make those emotional, difficult, wrenching decisions about end of life. It is a private matter between individuals and doctors, and when politicians attempt to force regulations through the back door by going after doctors and their ability to prescribe, in my view that is an obvious over-the-line Federal infringement. But my guess is there are probably going to be some folks on the far right that are going to try that route again.  Nothing Judge Gorsuch said in his confirmation hearing gave me any indication that he respects the death-with-dignity issue as settled law or that he would rule against Federal abuse of power to intrude on a private choice. The bottom line is that Judge Gorsuch is locked into an extreme rightwing viewpoint on this issue.  And there is more. As I have listened to this debate and, particularly, the number of comments that some of those who have espoused the views that concern me so much come back to, part of this is that they are always talking about States' rights. States' rights--that will be the altar that we really build our views and philosophies around. I will state, however, that when we listen to some of what they are having to say about States' rights, what they are really saying is that they are for the State if they think the State is right. That is not, in my view, what fundamental rights--particularly, ones that have been afforded to States--ought to be all about.  As I indicated, I think his views with respect to death with dignity really do involve a Federal abuse of power in its intruding on private choices, but there are other issues that concern me as well.  He has made it clear, in many instances, that he favors corporations at the expense of the working people. He has sided with insurance companies to deny disability benefits to people with disabilities, with large companies to deny employees basic job protections, and has even written that class action lawsuits are just tools for plaintiffs to get ``free rides to fast riches.''  No example better illustrates this tendency--and my colleagues have talked about it--than the case of the truckdriver in TransAm Trucking v. Department of In this case that leaves one practically speechless, Judge Gorsuch sided against a truckdriver who was fired for leaving his freezing cold truck when his life was in danger.  I have another significant concern about Judge Gorsuch that came up in the context of his confirmation hearings. It is something that, I think, a lot of Americans and even those in government are trying to get their arms around. I have been on the Intelligence Committee since the days before 9/11, and one of the things we have come to feel strongly about is the danger of what I call ``secret law.'' I want to make sure people know exactly what I am talking about when I describe ``secret law.''  In the intelligence world and in the national security sphere, operations and methods--the tactics used by our courageous men and women who are protecting us and who go into harm's way to protect our people--always have to be secret. They are classified. They have to be because, if they were to get out, we could have Americans die--the people who do all of that wonderful work and, possibly, millions more. Sources and methods have to be secret, but the law and our public policies ought to always be transparent.  The American people need to know about them because that is how we make informed decisions in our wonderful system of government. Voters are given enough information to make the choices. Sources and methods and operations have to be secret, but the law and political philosophies have to be public.  Judge Gorsuch, as a senior attorney in the Department of Justice, was a practitioner of secret law. As I indicated, the public is not going to know about secret operations; we protect them. But trust in government and in our legal system cannot survive when Americans understand that the law says one thing and then the government or a secret court says that it means another. Secret law prevents the people from knowing whether their fundamental rights are being infringed by an unaccountable, unconstrained government that is aided by compliant courts.  Secret law also keeps the Congress in the dark. Congress's job is to represent the people and oversee the government. Congress, barring rebellion, is the only recourse of a free people against an executive-judicial alliance of secrecy that infringes their liberties. It is my view that secret law makes a mockery of the oath that Members of Congress, Justices, and each Senator here has taken to serve, protect, and defend our Secret law is fundamentally corrosive to the rule of law in  As we learned during his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch was a supporter of secret law. In 2005, the CIA was conducting a secret torture program. In May of that year, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel determined, secretly, that torture techniques, such as waterboarding, were legal. Somehow, it deemed them consistent with statutory prohibitions on torture and the This was extraordinary, willful, faulty legal analysis. It was entirely inconsistent with how the Congress and the public would read the law or the  Then our distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who knows a little bit about these issues in his having been subjected to them in the defense of our country, passed the Detainee Treatment Senator McCain understood, in having fought for our country--given fully of himself--that our government had to find a way out of this problem. The McCain law prohibits the cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment that has been at issue here.  By any measure, both the law--the language of the law, the clear intent of the Congress--and the context in which it was passed would leave every American to understand that a decision had been made by their elected officials to limit the power of government. Yet Judge Gorsuch, then an employee of the Bush administration's, had a solution.  In December of 2005, he wrote to the author of the Justice Department's opinion, Mr.Bradbury, about a Presidential signing statement that would magically transform the McCain law into an endorsement of torture. What Judge Gorsuch wrote was that the McCain amendment that prohibited cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment was best read as, essentially, codifying existing interrogation policies. In other words, according to Judge Gorsuch, John McCain's law--the one that passed 90 to 9 in the U.Senate--endorsed torture when it did just the opposite.  The issue came up in his nomination hearing. Judge Gorsuch's explanation was that he was making the recommendation as a lawyer who was helping his client, which was the administration. I have to say, if there is one thing we have learned, this ``just following orders'' defense has gone on for far too long in this city. It is a small and feeble excuse and is unbecoming of a judge who has been nominated to the highest Court in the land. A judge who justifies government violations in the law and the Constitution just so his boss can say ``I was following the advice of counsel'' is making a choice to do wrong.  The McCain amendment--what we passed here in the Congress--did not green-light torture. It did not codify torture, period. Anybody who has ever heard John McCain talk about this issue and describe his personal, horrifying experiences with torture knows that it, certainly, could not have been his intent when writing the bill.  Any lawyer, especially one secretly advising the government, first has an obligation to the law and the Judge Gorsuch's failure to recognize that principle and his choice to do wrong, in my view, disqualifies him from having a seat on the U.Supreme  Torture is not the only illegal program on which Judge Gorsuch has left his fingerprints. After news broke of the illegal, warrantless wiretapping program, Judge Gorsuch helped prepare[[Page S2397]]testimony for the Attorney General, which asserted that these authorities are vested in the President and are inherent in the office.  It added: ``They cannot be diminished or legislated away by other co-equal branches of the government.''  If that were the case, then no action taken in this area by the elected representatives of the people would have any weight. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has existed since the 1970s, would just be some kind of advisory statement. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which we are going to debate this year, would be little more than wasted paper. Then the USA FREEDOM Act, which ended the bulk collection of law-abiding Americans' phone records, might as well have never been signed into law.  Voting for those bills and voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch call into question any Member's commitment to those laws that we passed.  In response to a question during his nomination hearing, Judge Gorsuch said that he did not believe the Attorney General's testimony and that, again, he was only acting as a scribe, as a speechwriter. As such, he absolved himself of responsibility for his actions. Again, I think that it is just wrong to use this as an excuse. Like the endorsement of torture, assertions of Presidential authority to override congressional limits on warrantless surveillance rip at the fabric of the rule of law. Judge Gorsuch, a man who chose to get up and go to work every day for individuals who were violating the law, had the power to say no, but he would not make that choice.  Colleagues, the Senate is voting to confirm an individual to a lifetime position on the Supreme What Judge Gorsuch has stood for and against over the course of his legal career is all we have to go on in this debate, and we will have to reflect on it. A history of support, in my view, for secret, illegal, and unconstitutional programs is an unacceptable record for someone who is seeking a place on the Supreme  I have reminded this Senate of how, time and again, the Supreme Court has rubber-stamped the excesses of our executive and legislature over the years rather than defended individual liberty. That is the record--the Supreme Court rubbing-stamping the excesses of the executive and legislature rather than protecting the individual liberties of the American people.  It is my view that it is our job as Senators to ensure that the Supreme Court does not repeat the errors of yesterday--enshrining disenfranchisement and discrimination and denying equal protection of the law based on prejudice and political agendas. I believe that the only way to prevent this abuse is to appoint judges who recognize that the judiciary is a bulwark against any attempt to infringe on our unalienable rights.  The bottom line for me, colleagues, is whether Judge Gorsuch recognizes that rights are reserved for the people.  There is no respect for individual rights and liberty to be found in a viewpoint that allows for secret law to justify torture, that favors the powerful over the powerless, or that tramples on the rights of Americans to determine the courses of their own lives. Unfortunately, we have learned over the last few weeks that this is Judge Gorsuch's record.  I oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

3777,topic-id,1252,"Mr.President, I spent the last few days having town hall meetings at home. It was a big challenge. We had a tremendous amount of snow. The distinguished Presiding Officer is very familiar with that. We had the most snow since 1937, and it just goes on and on. We are battling freezing rain. Yet Oregonians came out in big numbers to participate in the discussion about what is going on in Washington, They were particularly troubled about what was being done at the Environmental Protection Agency in the nomination of Scott Pruitt to head it. We had 200 people in McMinnville on Saturday night, a small community. I think the temperature was about 22 degrees. What really troubled them is that it sure looks like, when you examine the record of Mr.Pruitt, that he is trampling on everything we call the Oregon The Oregon Way is something that Democrats, Republicans, people across the political spectrum subscribe to because it involves protecting our treasured land, air, and water. It was something we want for our generation, and we will pass it on to our kids, and it has been hugely valuable to us in attracting more industries that pay well because the workers at those industries want clean air and clean water.  When you look at Mr.Pruitt's career, it really upends everything that I would call the Oregon Way--repeated attempts to weaken or eliminate health-based environmental standards, air quality standards for toxic air pollutants, limits on carbon emissions to take on the challenge of climate change. These rollbacks are particularly harmful to children and low-income households, communities of color, minorities, families, and communities.  Yesterday, Senator Merkley and I spoke at our wonderful Martin Luther King Day Breakfast put on by The Bernie and Bobbie Foster have been doing this for years. All I could think of is, if you roll back clean air and health standards, the people who are going to be hurt the most are low-income minorities, and communities of color. I don't see a big outcry in America for policies that would do that kind of harm to some of the most vulnerable  Mr.Pruitt also has a troubling history of denying that fundamental science really ought to be the basis of American policymaking when it comes to environmental protection.  For example, he disputed the Agency's science-based findings in 2009 that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Now, my view is that this is an inarguable and unfortunate reality of climate change. But Mr.Pruitt's challenge suggests either a misunderstanding about how environmental agencies ought to make science-based decisions or, even worse, a habit of setting science aside when the outcome is at odds with the special interests.  Again, that comes back to the kind of comments that were made during my five town hall meetings over the last few days at home. People would say: Look, Democrats and Republicans at home in Oregon, great Republican Governors--particularly led by the late Tom McCall--they would constantly come back to the proposition that you should not let the special interests trample on your treasures, your land and your air and your water, because not only was it bad for this generation--our generation--but it would be particularly damaging to our young people.  So it is really troubling that this has been the choice of the President-elect. My own view is that when it comes to environmental standards, one of the unsung successes of the last few years has been a rule cutting emissions of mercury, arsenic, lead, and other dangerous materials. It prevented, in 2016, 11,000 premature deaths. My concern is that a lot of those deaths would be seen in minority communities and communities of color, the people I was concerned about when we had our Martin Luther King Day  Mr.Pruitt worked hard to gut that rule. He really pulled out all the stops to oppose a rule cutting emissions of mercury, arsenic, lead and dangerous heavy metals. He worked hard to gut it. If he is confirmed, he may just possibly be successful.  Now, the message that I have heard again and again is that we can do better than this. We can do better than this. I think the American people, when they see what is at stake--it has been hard to follow all of the hearings. I know that I was very interested in the questioning in the Foreign Relations Committee by the Presiding I was trying to follow all the nominations, and I could not get to all the hearings. I could not follow all of the questioning that I thought was important.  But even when all of this is going on, when people tell you before a Trailblazers game--at home in Portland, a pregame event--that they are unhappy about the environmental rules and the prospects of the environmental rules being gutted by the new head of the EPA, you know that you have people alarmed.  Oregon is no stranger to the threats of pollution. In 2015, there was a discovery that heavy metals, including cadmium and arsenic, had been emitted for decades into the air of Portland neighborhoods at dangerous levels.  This pollution was caused by a regulatory loophole the size of Crater At the time, I called on the Environmental Protection Agency to take action. Within days, they were on the ground in Portland helping to assess the public health risks. Not long after, they identified the cause of the regulatory oversight and corrected course.  It seems to me that Americans need to trust that the Environmental Protection Agency will be able to defend their communities from air pollution or from water contamination. That is how we have always looked at it in my home State of We always felt that we could trust those that we elected of both political parties for years and years to say: You don't mess with Oregon's land and air and water.  Now, obviously, we have continued, even with that ethic, to have problems. While I was pleased that we were able to get some significant public health changes after we made that discovery in 2015 that there were heavy metals, including cadmium and arsenic, in the air of our neighborhoods, we have to do better. We have to do better at every level of government, and the EPA plays a critical role in ensuring clean and safe water, whether the water is running through a mountain stream or through a pipe to a Portland kitchen. Cities across the country, like my home town of Portland, are facing threats with high levels of lead in the water supply and outdated infrastructure to fix the problem.  These communities are counting on the Environmental Protection Agency[[Page S338]]to be in a partnership with them to get this fixed to enforce strong water quality standards, and it only can happen if you have strong leadership that starts at the top. The American people have a right to have confidence that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is going to defend the health and well-being of our communities and not the profits and the pocketbooks of the most powerful special interests in our country.  I am going to close by saying that I am not confident that a Pruitt EPA will stand on the side of those families against the special interests. That is why tonight I state that I will be opposing the nomination of Mr.Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Rubio).
