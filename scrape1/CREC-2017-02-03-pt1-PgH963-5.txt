    CONDEMNING ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE BY RUSSIAN-BACKED 
                              SEPARATISTS

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I strongly condemn 
the escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed 
separatists and call for an immediate withdrawal of heavy weapons.
  I am deeply concerned about the loss of life and deteriorating 
humanitarian conditions that exist there. There has been an 
``uncountable'' amount of violations of the Minsk agreement according 
to the OSCE. Russian separatist forces must immediately honor the 
ceasefire to allow for humanitarian assistance.
  I call on this administration to step up and see this through. 
Thousands have already died in this conflict, including at least eight 
in just the last 5 days. Seventeen thousand civilians, including 2,500 
children, do not have access to water, electricity, or heat during the 
height of winter.
  I urge Secretary Tillerson to provide Ukraine with defensive 
weapons--as Congress has already approved--and to provide meaningful 
support to our Ukranian allies against Putin's aggression.
  When it comes to Russia, we must see this administration's true 
colors.
