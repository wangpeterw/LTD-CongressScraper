      CELEBRATING THE 105TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRAND CANYON STATE

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on February 14, my home State of Arizona 
celebrated its 105th year as a member of the United States. The Grand 
Canyon State is an incredible State to raise a family in, to live in, 
and to play in.
  There is so much to love about Arizona. We have over 300 days of 
sunshine. We enjoy the cool pines of Flagstaff; the rustic and historic 
towns of Prescott, Show Low, and Tombstone, which give perspective into 
Arizona's first days as a State; and we greatly benefit from the 
agricultural city and county of Yuma.
  Arizona's lakes, mountains, forests, and skies provide countless 
activities throughout the year for natives and visitors alike. Arizona 
also enthusiastically hosts spring training, Super Bowls, college 
football playoff games, and the Waste Management Open, which many call 
``The Greatest Show on Grass.''
  Most of all, I love the people of Arizona. Arizonans are diverse, 
patriotic, and fiercely independent people. They bring so much talent 
and potential to our communities. I am deeply honored to serve my 
constituents in Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Sun Lakes, and Queen Creek.
  After a long week in Washington, I cannot wait to step off the plane

the fresh, free Arizona air. It is the greatest State in the Union, and 
I will always be proud to call Arizona my home.
  Happy birthday, State 48.
