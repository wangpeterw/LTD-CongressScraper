                         HONORING CALVIN IRVIN

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Calvin 
Irvin, a native of New Jersey and a resident of Greensboro, North 
Carolina, who passed away November 25, 2017.
  Cal, as he was fondly called, was an honorable man, dedicated to his 
community and to mentoring young student athletes. Over his career, he 
served as coach of Johnson C. Smith University's basketball team, and 
later as professor and head coach of North Carolina A&T's basketball 
team for 18 years.
  Cal always emphasized the importance of education, ensuring the 
dedication and perseverance that his athletes learned on the court was 
also exhibited in the classroom.
  A devoted citizen of the Greensboro community, he served in countless 
civic roles, including treasurer of the Convention and Tourism Bureau 
and a lifelong member of the NAACP.
  He brought his generous spirit and his heart home with him, too. He 
was a loving husband to his beloved wife, Kathryn, and to his nephew 
who was like a brother.
  As my longtime dear friend and supporter, Cal's golden heart shined a 
bright spot in my life, too. He will be sorely missed. His loss will be 
felt throughout our entire State and beyond.
  My thoughts and prayers continue to be with his wife, Kathryn, his 
family, his friends, and his community.
