               2017, AS ``NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK''

  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Baldwin, and Mr. Hoeven) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary :

                              S. Res. 341

       Whereas a highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete 
     in the global economy and to support economic growth;
       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system 
     established by the Act of August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et 
     seq.) (commonly known as the ``National Apprenticeship Act'') 
     (referred to in this preamble as the ``national registered 
     apprenticeship system''), which has existed for over 75 
     years--
       (1) is an important pathway for workers of the United 
     States;
       (2) offers a combination of--
       (A) academic and technical instruction; and
       (B) paid, on-the-job, training;
       (3) provides workers of the United States credentials that 
     are nationally-recognized and industry-recognized;
       (4) leads to higher earnings for apprentices; and
       (5) develops a highly skilled workforce for the United 
     States;
       Whereas registered apprenticeships--
       (1) are becoming increasingly innovative and diverse in--
       (A) design;
       (B) partnerships;
       (C) timeframes; and
       (D) use of emerging educational and training concepts; and
       (2) will continue to--
       (A) evolve to meet emerging skill essentials and employer 
     requirements; and
       (B) maintain high standards for apprentices;
       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system 
     provides education and training for apprentices in--
       (1) high-growth sectors, including--
       (A) information technology;
       (B) financial services;
       (C) advanced manufacturing; and
       (D) health care; and
       (2) traditional industries;
       Whereas, according to the Department of Labor, the national 
     registered apprenticeship system leverages approximately 
     $1,000,000,000 in private investment, which reflects the 
     strong commitment of the sponsors of the national registered 
     apprenticeship system;
       Whereas an evaluation of registered apprenticeship programs 
     in 10 States conducted by Mathematica Policy Research in 2012 
     found that--
       (1) individuals who completed registered apprenticeship 
     programs earned over $240,000 more over their careers than 
     individuals who did not participate in registered 
     apprenticeship programs;
       (2) the estimated social benefits of each registered 
     apprenticeship program (including additional productivity of 
     apprentices and the reduction in governmental expenditures as 
     a result of reduced use of unemployment compensation and 
     public assistance) exceeded the costs of each registered 
     apprenticeship program by more than $49,000; and
       (3) the tax return on every dollar the Federal Government 
     invested in registered apprenticeship programs was $27; and
       Whereas celebration of National Apprenticeship Week--
       (1) honors industries that use the registered 
     apprenticeship model;
       (2) encourages expansion of the registered apprenticeship 
     model to prepare highly skilled workers of the United States;
       (3) recognizes the role the national registered 
     apprenticeship system has played in preparing workers of the 
     United States for jobs; and
       (4) promotes conversation about ways the national 
     registered apprenticeship system can continue to respond to 
     workforce challenges in the 21st century: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week beginning 
     November 13, 2017, as ``National Apprenticeship Week''.
