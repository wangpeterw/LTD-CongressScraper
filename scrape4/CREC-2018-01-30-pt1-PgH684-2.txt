          HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF BISHOP ALEXIS THOMAS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Gallego) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Bishop Alexis Thomas, who passed away on January 18, 2018.
  Bishop Thomas was many things to many people. He was an inspiring 
pastor. He was a father, a son, and a brother. He was a dynamic and 
passionate leader not just at Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church, but 
throughout our community in Phoenix. Under his careful stewardship, 
Pilgrim Rest grew by leaps and bounds.
  However, Bishop Thomas' service extended well beyond the church. 
Bishop Thomas founded the African American Christian Clergy Coalition 
and cofounded the African American Strategic Alliance Coalition in 
Phoenix. Thanks to these endeavors and many others, Bishop Thomas will 
be remembered as a man with a remarkable vision for change who was 
taken from us way too soon.
  Mr. Speaker, I was proud to call Bishop Thomas my friend. I can 
personally attest that he worked miracles, large and small, every day 
in Phoenix and in Arizona. He touched more lives than we will ever 
know. And though we are devastated by his loss, we know that his legacy 
of service and love will live forever in our community.
