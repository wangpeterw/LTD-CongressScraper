             CELEBRATING MAPLE LEAF FARMS' 60TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Maple Leaf 
Farms on celebrating 60 wonderful years. This family-owned operation 
has been a staple in northern Indiana and the U.S. duck industry since 
1958.
  While 60 years of successful operations is a tremendous 
accomplishment, Maple Leaf Farms' expansion, production capabilities, 
and newest global ventures speak volumes to the dedication and 
ingenuity of the Tucker family. I am proud to learn of the strong 
business model and outstanding leadership of the Tuckers that has led 
Maple Leaf Farms to handle 10 million ducks a year and supply products 
worldwide.
  It is truly an honor to represent such passionate and committed 
Hoosier farmers as the Tuckers. I am grateful for the positive 
contributions they have made to our community.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Second District Hoosiers, I want to thank 
Maple Leaf Farms for strengthening Indiana's farming community, and I 
wish them all the best in their next 60 years.
