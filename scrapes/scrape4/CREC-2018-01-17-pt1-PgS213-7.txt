                                  FISA

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, now, on another matter, the Senate will 
soon vote to reauthorize important provisions of the FISA Amendments 
Act. This includes section 702, one of the most important tools used by 
our national security community to combat terrorism and to keep 
Americans safe. It gives our law enforcement and intelligence 
communities the ability to collect communications from foreign 
terrorists on foreign soil who wish harm to America and our allies. 
This capability is absolutely vital to the success of defense and 
intelligence operations.
  To be absolutely clear, section 702 does not allow the targeting of 
American citizens, nor does it permit the targeting of anyone of any 
nationality who is known to be located here in the United States. Five 
years ago, Congress reauthorized the title with overwhelming bipartisan 
support. Today, it is time to do so one more time.
  It is no secret that the world remains dangerous. Terrorist groups 
remain as intent today as they did on September 11, 2001, on harming 
Americans and those working with us overseas. As the tragedies of that 
day become a more distant memory, we cannot grow lax and deny our 
defense and intelligence communities the tools and resources they 
require to prevent future attacks.
  I look forward to renewing the bipartisan consensus on this issue and 
voting to reauthorize this important provision very soon.
