           CONGRATULATING THE NKU NORSE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to start by taking a moment to 
congratulate the men's basketball team of Northern Kentucky University 
for an impressive accomplishment.
  My home State of Kentucky is without a doubt known for college 
basketball, and now we have another reason to be proud. With last 
night's win, the NKU Norse secured the Horizon League championship and 
earned a ticket to the NCAA Tournament. With their recent entrance into 
Division I play, this is the first year the Norse have been eligible 
for a spot in the tournament, and their season of hard work has paid 
off.
  I would like to congratulate the team, Head Coach John Brannen, and 
the entire program, and I look forward to watching them continue their 
incredible season.
