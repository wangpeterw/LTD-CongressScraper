                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory 
limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to 
those limits, while sections 302 and 3141(a) of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to 
establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels 
consistent with those adjustments The Senate is considering S. Amdt. 
808, which provides emergency funding for disaster relief.
  This legislation includes language that increases nonsecurity 
discretionary budget authority by $15,250 million this year and 
designates it as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) 
of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority will not outlay in 
2017.
  As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the 
allocation to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing the revised 
nonsecurity budget authority by $15,250 million Further, I am 
increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2017 by $15,250 
million in budget authority.
  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide 
details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:
