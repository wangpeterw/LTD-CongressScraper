                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  You are the source of life and love. Hear the prayers of Congress, 
both for the good of this Nation and the good of humanity around the 
world. Help this Congress and the President to discern Your will in our 
day.
  By drawing on the truth taken from a diversity of opinions, may a 
solid foundation be formed upon which a stable future may be built.
  May short-term gains or self-interest never prove to be an obstacle 
to true vision. Rather, Lord, grant depth perceptions, clear analysis, 
and creative response to the needs of our time for solidifying the 
common good, for we freely choose to be Your people and act 
accordingly.
  And finally, may all that is done this day be for Your greater honor 
and glory.
  Amen.
