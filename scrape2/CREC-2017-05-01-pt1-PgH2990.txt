                          RECOGNIZING MEG DALY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Meg Daly, who 
is the founder of The Underline, a wonderful 10-mile linear park and 
urban trail in my congressional district that will serve to connect 
hundreds of Americans across Miami-Dade County through safe, 
alternative methods of transportation.
  In 2013, Meg had an unfortunate accident that broke both of her arms. 
Since she couldn't drive herself to attend physical therapy, she took 
the Metrorail near her home and walked underneath the train tracks to 
reach her destination. That is when Meg took notice of the 
underutilized land right below the Metrorail and envisioned its 
transformative potential for community mobility, positive economic 
impact, and enhanced quality of life.
  The Underline counts with overwhelming support across Miami-Dade, 
providing for a safe and healthy space for our community members to 
express themselves. From free yoga classes to artistic festivals to 
projects to restore Miami's urban green space, each day The Underline 
is getting closer to becoming what Meg has envisioned.
  Congratulations to one of our community's leaders, Meg Daly.
