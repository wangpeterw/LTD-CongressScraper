                         PROTECTING OUR BORDER

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, the past several days, I had my first-ever 
tour of our southwest border. During my visit, I met with Border Patrol 
agents in New Mexico and Texas, as well as ranchers and business 
leaders on the border.
  Border security was a significant issue in the last election, as 
Americans are concerned about the flow of illegal narcotics and aliens 
across the border. Although gaps in security remain, I saw an 
impressive array of assets, including drones and manned aircraft, 
walls, cameras, and other materiel.
  More impressive, however, are the men and women who work for Customs 
and Border Protection, who, at no small risk to themselves, work to 
keep America secure. They are very encouraged lately as they see policy 
changes coming that will allow them to enforce our laws. Mr. Speaker, 
these individuals are literally on the front line defending our Nation 
and communities, and I thank them for their service.
  I understand that there are job opportunities with Border Patrol. For 
those seeking a public service career doing something bigger than 
themselves, that is something to consider.
