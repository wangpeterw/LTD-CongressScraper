                      IN TRIBUTE TO IRIS CAMPBELL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, former first lady of South 
Carolina, Iris Campbell, wife of the late Governor Carroll Campbell, 
passed away last week. South Carolinians are grateful for her 
dedication to our citizens.
  Born in Greenville, Iris Campbell was married to the love of her 
life, Carroll Campbell, for 46 years. Together, they built successful 
small businesses and then served the people they loved for three 
decades, being instrumental in the development of the two-party system, 
with Carroll Campbell being the first Republican elected to Congress 
from Greenville-Spartanburg in over 100 years.
  As South Carolina's first lady from 1987 to 1995, Iris Campbell 
devoted herself to service organizations, including the American Cancer 
Society, the March of Dimes, and Carolina Children's Home. She served 
on the board of trustees for Richland Memorial Children's Hospital.
  When Governor Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Iris Campbell 
devoted herself to caring for him and to raising money for Alzheimer's 
research and the Carroll Campbell Place for Alzheimer's Care of 
Lexington Medical Center in Lexington.
  Roxanne and I join all South Carolinians in thanking the Campbell 
family, especially sons Carroll, Jr.--Tumpy--and Mike for sharing Iris 
with us. She has made South Carolina better, and we will miss her.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
