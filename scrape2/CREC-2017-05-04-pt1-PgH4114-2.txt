       MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING FIRST LIEUTENANT WESTON C. LEE.

  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor First 
Lieutenant Weston C. Lee of Bluffton, Georgia, who died on April 29, 
2017, in Mosul, Iraq, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.
  First Lieutenant Lee died from injuries sustained while part of a 
train, advise, and assist mission in support of partner forces.
  First Lieutenant Lee was assigned to Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 
325th Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, 
North Carolina.
  I would like to extend my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his 
team, his family, and his friends who have suffered this loss.
  Thank you, Lieutenant Weston Lee, for your service and sacrifice to 
our Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I would use the remainder of my time in a moment of 
silence in honor of Lieutenant Lee.
