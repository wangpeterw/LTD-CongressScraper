                    HONORING THE LIFE OF EMIL FRANZI

  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Emil 
Franzi, a dear friend and a legend in our southern Arizona community.
  Born on the Fourth of July, Emil Franzi was a patriot and outspoken 
conservative commentator, political strategist, columnist, and talk 
show host who had an encyclopedic knowledge of local politics. Franzi's 
radio career spanned three decades, and he was host for the ``Inside 
Track.'' His passing marks the end of an era.
  Franzi loved classical opera, guns, and the old west. He worked to 
preserve local western heritage through his ``Voices of the West'' 
radio show.
  Underneath his curmudgeonly exterior was a soft and charitable heart. 
Not only did he raise three successful daughters, he also took in a 
number of youth as a foster parent with his wife, Kathy. Franzi also 
adopted many stray animals. One of them, here, he named after me: 
Martha, this 6-month-old puppy--one of the highest honors I have 
received as a fellow dog lover.
  Emil Franzi passed away on June 7 after battling cancer. He was 78. 
He left an indelible mark on southern Arizona. I am deeply grateful for 
Emil's friendship, advice, and his faithful support. He will be sorely 
missed.
