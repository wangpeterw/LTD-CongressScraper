                         TAX PLAN AND EDUCATION

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, are there students in our 
country who think college has become too affordable? parents who feel 
that saving for their children's education has become too easy? I know 
that my constituents would certainly answer with a resounding ``no.''
  Why would anyone support a tax bill that would make college even more 
expensive for our students?
  When will we start working together to put the interests of average 
Americans before the interests of large corporations?
  According to the Ways and Means summary, the Republican tax bill 
would increase the cost to students attending college by $65 billion--
that is billion with a B--over the next decade.
  This administration promised to put money back in the pockets of 
Americans who need it the most, and this misguided tax bill does the 
exact opposite.
  Mr. Speaker, education is the cornerstone of our global 
competitiveness, and this Republican bill would only make college less 
affordable and less accessible. I urge my colleagues to reject this 
assault on the middle class.
