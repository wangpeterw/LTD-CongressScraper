                  WHERE IS THE PLAN, PRESIDENT TRUMP?

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, as we approach President Trump's 
100th day in office, I rise to address the vision, the agenda, and the 
plans the White House has laid out. Except, Mr. Speaker, there are no 
plans to speak up.
  President Trump promised an agenda that was supposed to make America 
great again, but no one in America or the administration seems to know 
what that includes. As the dust settles on the cruise missile strike in 
Syria and the dropping of bombs in Afghanistan, where is the plan for 
ISIS, Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan that Candidate Trump promised?
  The President said his $1 trillion infrastructure plan to create 
millions of jobs is coming fast, but, again, where is the plan? 
Instead, President Trump's one-page proposal is a massive $2 trillion 
giveaway to corporations and the wealthy and doesn't include a penny 
for infrastructure. That is a missed opportunity.
  I could keep going. Where is the plan on fixing America's water 
infrastructure? Where is the plan on making trade fair for American 
workers? Where is the plan to provide affordable childcare that the 
President promised?
  Mr. Speaker, there is a hard truth the President needs to realize: 
the difficult work of governing on behalf of the American people is 
more than tweets and photo ops. The President's first 100 days have 
been all talk and no action.
