                    WELCOMING REVEREND MOLLY FRASER

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
Kilmer) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to welcome Pastor Molly 
Fraser from Gig Harbor United Methodist Church, my home church.
  Our church isn't the biggest church, it isn't the oldest church, but 
it has left a large impact throughout Gig Harbor because it makes clear 
that all are welcome. Whether you are in pain and need somewhere to go 
or you are looking for fellowship, there is a welcome mat for you.
  It makes clear to regular attendees and to newcomers that it is a 
place of open hearts, open minds, and open doors. It is a place that is 
committed to supporting the needs of those most in need throughout our 
community and around the world. It is a place to ask tough questions 
and to celebrate our faith.
  Finally, it is a place that benefits from the tremendous leadership 
of Pastor Molly, who, during her brief tenure with the church, has 
brought incredible energy and heart and musical talent.
  She is here in our Nation's capital today with her family. It is my 
honor to welcome them and, in spirit, the entire congregation of Gig 
Harbor United Methodist Church.
