                   PRESIDENT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION BAN

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump has stained the American 
Presidency with his unAmerican values.
  His Muslim ban has caused the suffering of countless families seeking 
the American promise of a better life, and it has put the safety of the 
American people at risk by providing fodder for extremist groups who 
wish to do us harm.
  I condemn this ban and the unfit President behind it. I ask my 
Republican colleagues who have stood by and said nothing: How can you 
remain silent?
  The American people are sending a clear message that they will not 
remain silent. I have received a large volume of calls from 
constituents in opposition to the Muslim ban. It is unfortunate that 
these calls are necessary, but I am glad the American people are paying 
attention and are committed to holding this administration accountable.
  I want to add that hundreds of Syrian refugees have settled in New 
Jersey. Many have settled in Jersey City, which is part of my district, 
and I am proud to be their Member of Congress. These refugees have 
escaped chaos at home and went through a rigorous screening process 
before entering the United States. They are respectful of America's 
values. The same cannot be said of this President.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Francis Rooney of Florida). Members are 
reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the 
President.
