     CELEBRATING MARS PETCARE FOR TWO MILLION MAN HOUR SAFETY AWARD

  (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mars, 
Incorporated, and Mars Petcare's Fort Smith, Arkansas, facility which 
was recently honored with the Two Million Man Hour Safety Award from 
the Arkansas Department of Labor.
  As a family-owned business since its founding in 1911, Mars has been 
a leading example of corporate responsibility practices that benefit 
their dedicated employees and the communities in which they operate.
  Since Mars first opened the doors of its Petcare facility in Fort 
Smith in 2007, they have provided stable employment to over 200 Mars 
associates who are responsible for making food for our pets under the 
brand names Cesar, Nutro, and Sheba.
  Impressively, Mars' Fort Smith facility has accumulated 2 million 
work hours over 5 years without a lost day away from work due to a 
work-related injury or illness, a direct testament to the great 
workforce in Fort Smith and the leadership of the Mars organization.
  In addition to their excellent safety record, Mars has had a 
significant impact on my district's local economy. Recently, Mars 
Petcare announced plans to expand the Fort Smith facility, which is 
expected to generate an additional 130 new jobs over the next several 
years.
  On behalf of everyone in northwest Arkansas, I am happy to celebrate 
this important milestone with Mars' Fort Smith facility, and I thank 
Mars for its continued dedication to our community.
