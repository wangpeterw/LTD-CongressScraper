                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  On this day, we ask Your blessing on the men and women, citizens all, 
whose votes have populated this people's House. Each Member of this 
House has been given the sacred duty of representing them.
  O Lord, we pray that those with whom our Representatives might meet 
during this coming long weekend in their home districts be blessed with 
peace and an assurance that they have been listened to.
  We ask Your blessing now on the Members of this House whose 
responsibility lies also beyond the local interests of constituents 
while honoring them. Give each Member the wisdom to represent both 
local and national interests, a responsibility calling for the wisdom 
of Solomon. Grant them, if You will, a double portion of such wisdom.
  Bless us this day and every day, and may all that is done within the 
people's House be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
