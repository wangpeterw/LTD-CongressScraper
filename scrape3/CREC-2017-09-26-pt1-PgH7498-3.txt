                         OPPOSE GRAHAM-CASSIDY

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
millions of Americans whose health coverage is once again being 
threatened by efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The American people have spoken. They do not want repeal. They 
certainly do not want the ACA replaced by Graham-Cassidy, the latest, 
cruelest version of TrumpCare.
  Nearly every health organization in America, from the insurance 
providers to doctors, to hospitals, to patient advocacy groups, oppose 
Graham-Cassidy because it will result in skyrocketing premiums and 
copays and loss of coverage for millions of Americans, particularly 
older Americans who need the care most.
  It is time to abandon the rhetoric of repeal and replace and to work 
together to stabilize our healthcare markets. Senators Murray and 
Alexander were working together on a bipartisan bill to fix the ACA 
before the Republican majority abandoned their efforts for Graham-
Cassidy.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope we return to bipartisan efforts as soon as 
possible to stabilize markets and improve access to healthcare for all 
Americans.
