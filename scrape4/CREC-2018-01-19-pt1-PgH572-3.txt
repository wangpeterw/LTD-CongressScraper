                 PRO-LIFE YOUTH ARE LEADERS OF TOMORROW

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the sanctity of human life and to redouble my commitment to 
protecting the most vulnerable among us: the unborn.
  Today, more than 100,000 pro-lifers from across the country are in 
Washington, D.C., for the 45th annual March for Life. This year's theme 
is: ``Love Saves Lives.'' And, Madam Speaker, it surely does. Thanks to 
the pro-life movement, abortion rates across the country are at the 
lowest since 2013.
  Today's march is one of the best events of the year, and I am always 
pleased to see so many young people standing for life. They are the 
leaders of tomorrow. And to see so many individuals here today, 
standing for what they believe in, truly gives me great hope for the 
future of the pro-life movement.
  We must always be a voice for the voiceless, and we continue to build 
a culture that values lives and respects mothers and their children.
  Madam Speaker, we all know that ``Love Saves Lives.''
