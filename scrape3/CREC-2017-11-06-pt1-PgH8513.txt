 EXTEND TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS FOR HAITIANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am joining the Congressional Black 
Caucus to ask for an extension of the temporary protective status for 
Haitians.
  I am absolutely appalled that this government would deny this 
extension and only allow it for 6 months. Apparently, they are not 
aware of the scarcity of food in Haiti and the cholera epidemic. All of 
these challenges are continuing since 2011.
  Along with the Haitians, I understand that they have now taken away 
TPS from 300,000 Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Salvadorans as well. This 
is an outrageous act, and it is important for them to act immediately.
  I also stand against the scam tax plan. The scam tax plan would, in 
fact, take away opportunities for Americans to have higher education, 
build the deficit way beyond one's recognition, would not create jobs, 
would send jobs overseas, would allow for 80 percent of the benefits to 
go to the top 1 percent, and, frankly, would provide no benefits for 
middle class, hardworking Americans.
  This plan is not tax cuts and jobs; it is a tax scam with no jobs.
  I ask my colleagues to vote against this tax bill, and I ask this 
administration to do what is right and provide humanitarian relief and 
extend the TPS for Haitians and all others similarly situated for 18 
months.
