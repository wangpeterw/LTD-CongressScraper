                      NOMINATION OF JEFFREY ROSEN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote to 
advance another well-qualified nominee,

[[Page S2924]]

Jeffrey Rosen, to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of 
Transportation. Mr. Rosen has extensive experience serving at both the 
Office of Management and Budget and at the Department of 
Transportation. When he last came before the Senate to be the Chief 
Legal Officer of the Department of Transportation, he was confirmed by 
voice vote. It is disappointing that we had to file cloture on this 
bipartisan choice this time around.
  Mr. Rosen's work in both the private and public sectors has given him 
a unique insight into the budgetary and regulatory challenges that 
infrastructure projects face. I look forward to the Senate advancing 
his nomination later this afternoon.
