                              {time}  1903

  So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and 
the bill, as amended, was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote today on 
H.R. 4533--To designate the health care system of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs in Lexington, Kentucky, as the ``Lexington VA Health 
Care System'' and to make certain other designations, (rollcall No. 
70), I would have voted ``aye.''
  Additionally, had I been present for the vote on H.R. 4979--To extend 
the Generalized System of Preference and to make technical changes to 
the competitive need limitations provision of the program (rollcall No. 
71), I would have voted ``aye.''
