                 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, Rotary International recognized 
champions who have worked to eradicate polio around the world. Rotary 
International has done a great job, and the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation has, too.
  But as one of two congressional Members who were purple hearts of the 
polio years, I wish to thank them, but also say how dreadful it is--and 
awful--that the budget that is being proposed will reduce funding by 
almost 20 percent to the National Institutes of Health and also to the 
CDC.
  The CDC and the National Institutes of Health protect us from health 
scourges and look for cures and treatments that can protect people in 
the future. The National Institutes of Health needs to have more 
funding, not less, and so does the CDC.
