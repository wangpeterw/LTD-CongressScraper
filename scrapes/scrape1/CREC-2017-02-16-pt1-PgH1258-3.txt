               GENERAL FLYNN, PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND RUSSIA

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, the question that I have heard many times 
from my constituents deserves to be answered: With respect to General 
Flynn and Trump campaign aides, what did President Trump know, and when 
did he know it?
  How high does this go up?
  Now he is calling this fake news.
  Mr. President, this is not fake news. This is real.
  The American people deserve a transparent, independent investigation 
into Russia's involvement with the White House and President Trump.
  President Trump continually says he wants to protect our national 
security, but he ignores the real security threats within his 
administration.
  Even my colleagues across the aisle would rather focus on taking away 
health care from millions of Americans and thousands of Nevadans 
instead of investigating the clear and present danger in the Trump 
administration.
  Enough is enough. Protecting our national security is not a 
Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American priority.
