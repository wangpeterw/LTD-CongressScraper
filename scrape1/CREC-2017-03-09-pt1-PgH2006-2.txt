           HONORING CHRISTOPHER ``NOTORIOUS B.I.G.'' WALLACE

  (Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of 
Brooklyn's own Notorious B.I.G., Jamaican-American Christopher Wallace.
  In celebration of his life and living legacy, I share these words:

     Thinkin' back on my one-room shack,
     Now my mom pimps an Ac with minks on her back.
     And she loves to show me off of course,
     Smiles every time my face is up in The Source.
     We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us,
     No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us.
     Birthdays was the worst days,
     Now we sip champagne when we thirsty,
     Uh, right, I like the life I live,
     'Cause I went from negative to positive.
     And it's all good.
     And if you don't know, now you know.

                          ____________________
