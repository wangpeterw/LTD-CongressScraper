                                TAX SCAM

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, what do these people have in common: a 
teacher who buys a prom dress for her student; a teacher who buys 
crayons and pencils for her students; a teacher who buys packages of 
paper for his students; my mom, who calls me and says, ``Don't cut my 
Medicare. Don't let them cut my Medicare''; the person who has a heart 
attack or is paying hard-earned money for his or her cancer treatment?
  None of those people will be able to write off their medical expenses 
or their educational expenses. My mom and other seniors will see a $25 
billion cut in Medicare.
  What they have in common is that this tax scam will hurt all of them, 
as opposed to the folks who are the richest among us. The corporations 
who are doing very, very well, they will see the tax benefits.
  This is not a tax plan, it is a tax scam, and our people that we 
serve deserve better.
