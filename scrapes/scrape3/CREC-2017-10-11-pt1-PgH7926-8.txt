                          ARMY NATIONAL GUARD

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize the Army 
National Guard's 236th Engineering Company. Located in Stephenville, 
Texas, they were the first on the ground in Houston to assist with 
Hurricane Harvey relief efforts on August 27. Over the course of a 
week, they rescued approximately 2,300 civilians and 380 animals from 
flooded areas.
  Mr. Speaker, these men and women who serve our country are true 
heroes, and I am honored to represent them in the 25th Congressional 
District of Texas. I had the opportunity to meet with these soldiers a 
few weeks ago and personally shake their hands to thank them for a job 
well done.
  They stepped up in a moment of absolute crisis and when the people of 
Texas needed them most. They put their lives on the line in order to 
save others. Without them, the number of deaths could have been 
significantly higher.
  It is because of selfless people like these that America is able to 
remain the strongest country in the world. The Lone Star State cannot 
thank them enough for their swift and noble actions, and we will always 
remember their heroism.
  Hurricane Harvey victims are still recovering, and all of America is 
behind them. We will rebuild together because we are all Texas strong.
  God bless Texas, God bless the military, and God bless the United 
States of America.
  In God we trust.
