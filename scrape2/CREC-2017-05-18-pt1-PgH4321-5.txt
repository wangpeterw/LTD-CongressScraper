                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Glen Berteau, The House Modesto, Modesto, California, offered 
the following prayer:
  God, Your Word says that unity and light extinguish darkness and 
chaos. We debate opinions while not recognizing that You are the 
answer. Behind me the words ``In God We Trust'' are not a suggestion.
  God, we have told You to leave, but come back to our schools, our 
businesses, our streets, our families, our government. I ask You to 
fill the political seats in America with God-fearing, God-following 
leaders. I pray for our Nation to stop rising up in division against 
one another and instead kneel down and pray for one another.
  Instead of petitioning opinions and protest, we petition You in 
prayer. I pray for hate to dissipate from the heart of our society. 
Lord, You are our protection, our sustaining power.
  Protect our first responders. Protect our powerful military. Protect 
the citizens of this great Nation, and let us not forget that You are 
our national security.
  In Jesus' name.
  Amen.
