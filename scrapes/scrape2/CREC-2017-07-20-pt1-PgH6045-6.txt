                           ILLINOIS FLOODING

  (Mr. ROSKAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, it has been a difficult week in northern 
Illinois. A little over a week ago, torrential rains fell on Wisconsin 
and northern Illinois. Four Illinois counties have been named disaster 
areas: Lake County, McHenry County, Kane County, and Cook County.
  As difficult as it is, it is an incredibly impressive thing to visit 
these communities, particularly Algonquin, Port Barrington, and Fox 
River Grove, among others, all in the Sixth Congressional District. 
What you will witness is literally hundreds of volunteers following 
through and filling thousands of bags of sand to help their neighbors.
  Municipal employees, first responders, local leaders, the Governor of 
Illinois, and members of the Illinois delegation have all come together 
in order to meet our neighbors' needs at this time.
  For those of you who are people of faith, I ask that you would pray 
for these families as they are going through this difficult time. Also, 
I commend those at home who have lent a hand.
