 MOURNING THE LOSS OF SPECIALIST CARLTON BUTLER OF NORTH MIAMI, FLORIDA

  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share sad news from my 
district. Miami is mourning the loss of another young American hero who 
died while serving our great Nation.
  Specialist Carlton Butler from North Miami, who was just 22 years 
old, was found dead at Fort Bragg in North Carolina last Saturday 
evening. He was a paratrooper assigned to B Company, 2nd Battalion 
505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The circumstances of his death are 
under investigation and are very troubling to me and to his family.
  Like Sergeant La David Johnson, my constituent who was killed last 
month during an ambush in Niger, Specialist Butler made an immediate 
and overwhelmingly positive impression during his short tenure in the 
military. Like Sergeant Johnson's family, Specialist Butler's family is 
left wondering why and how their soldier's life ended in such a 
suspicious manner.
  They have many questions, and so do I. I am determined to help get 
the answers they need to heal. Both families need answers in order to 
heal. I will not stop pushing until these families are satisfied. When 
such devastating losses occur, we owe it to them to find answers as 
quickly as possible.
  These answers are not acceptable: ``We really don't know.'' ``We are 
investigating.'' ``We can't say that.''
  Mr. Speaker, we seek the truth and our military families deserve the 
truth.
