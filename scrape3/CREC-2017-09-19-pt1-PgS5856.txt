50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT OF THE AIR 
                                 FORCE

  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, September 18, 2017, was the 70th 
anniversary of the U.S. Air Force. Since its inception, it has 
repeatedly proven that it is indeed the finest air force in the world.
  Among the greatest strengths of the U.S. Air Force is its enlisted 
corps, which is recognized worldwide as being comprised of the best 
educated, best trained, best motivated, and most dedicated men and 
women of any air force anywhere.
  The office of the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force was created 
in 1967 based in large measure on strong advocacy by the Air Force 
Association and has been filled by 18 brilliant leaders, including the 
present Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Kaleth O. Wright.
  The U.S. Air Force core values of ``Integrity First, Service Before 
Self, and Excellence in All We Do'' are embodied in the office of the 
Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, in the Air Force enlisted 
corps, and in all men and women serving in the U.S. Air Force.
  The Senate Air Force Caucus joins the Air Force Association and 
airmen worldwide in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the creation of 
the Office of the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.
