                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, You alone reign supreme in our Nation and world. May our 
lawmakers permit You to direct their steps. Give our Senators a renewed 
sense of Your sacred presence, filling them with reverence for You. May 
this reverence engender in them a spirit of profound gratitude for Your 
goodness and grace.
  Lord, inspire them to live such exemplary lives that Your Name will 
be glorified in the Earth. Help them to relinquish all anxieties to 
You, as they remember Your promise to supply all their needs. May they 
dedicate themselves to providing opportunities and justice for all 
Americans.
  And, Lord, bring comfort to the families of our military personnel 
killed in the C-130 crash in Mississippi.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
