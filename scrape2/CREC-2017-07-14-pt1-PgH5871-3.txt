          WE CANNOT LET POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF PATRIOTISM

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow politics to get in the way 
of patriotism in this House.
  We might disagree about healthcare, or we might disagree about tax 
reform, but I know that there are patriots in this House who want to 
stand together against Russian interference in our elections, patriots 
who will record their votes for country above party.
  The Senate passed Russia sanctions 98-2. This is not controversial 
policy. The controversy, Mr. Speaker, is the refusal to let us vote on 
it. If you call the vote, Russian sanctions would pass; they would pass 
with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of patriots, those of us who 
refuse to let anyone stand in the way of defending our Nation.
  When this Nation is under attack, we must come together, Mr. Speaker. 
Let us vote to condemn Russian cyber attacks, let us vote to insulate 
sanctions from political interference, and let us stand together as 
patriots to defend the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, bring the Russia sanctions bill, the one that passed the 
Senate last week, the one that passed 98-2, bring it to a vote here, 
let us pass it, send it to the President's desk, and see whether he 
will sign it.
