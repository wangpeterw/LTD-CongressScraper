                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We come to You as a nation in the midst of significant, imminent 
transition, even as important disagreements on policy promise vigorous 
debate in the days to come.
  As people look for causes and solutions, the temptation is great to 
seek ideological position. We ask that You might send Your spirit of 
peace and reconciliation, that instead of ascendency over opponents, 
the Members of this people's House and all elected to represent our 
Nation might work together, humbly, recognizing the best in each 
other's hopes to bring stability and direction toward a strong future.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
