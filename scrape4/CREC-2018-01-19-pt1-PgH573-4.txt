                           ANNOUNCED BONUSES

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
immediate benefits that H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is already 
delivering for American families.
  Soon after it was signed into law, a number of large companies had 
already announced large bonuses for their employees, crediting the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act. For example, American Airlines, AT&T, JetBlue, 
Nationwide, and Southwest Airlines all announced $1,000 bonuses for 
their hardworking employees. Other companies that announced bonuses 
include AFLAC, Wells Fargo, and SunTrust, and I expect more to join 
this list.
  With an administration and Congress that support American businesses, 
we are not only seeing numbers of high consumer confidence and low 
unemployment, but we are watching the direct benefits that our policies 
are having on American families.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing how our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
will continue to benefit Americans throughout 2018.
