           By Mr. GRAVES of Missouri:
       H.R. 847.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 4, Section 3
       ``The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all 
     needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or 
     other property belonging to the United States. . .''
       The outgoing Administration changed the name using prior 
     executive authority despite the public support for the 
     current name--Squaw Creek. Therefore, as Congress, we are 
     using our authority and prerogative under the Constitution 
     with regard to federal lands.
