                      WHITE ELEPHANT GIFT EXCHANGE

  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for those with silk stockings, it is a very 
Merry Christmas indeed. The billionaires get stuffed, but we get coal. 
It is like a White Elephant gift exchange. The billionaires grab the 
good gifts, and the leftovers go to working families, though they get 
the bill for everything.
  How many millions of dollars the Trump family will personally stuff 
in their pockets cannot be precisely determined, only because of 
continuing Republican collusion to cover up Trump's personal tax 
returns.
  Excluding the public, refusing to even permit Democrats to offer an 
amendment, Republicans dumped this proposal out this weekend and now 
demand an immediate vote. The dangers lurking in this bill for economic 
opportunity, for tax fairness, are very real, but they are overshadowed 
by the dangers to our democracy from these Trump tactics to impose his 
rule on America.
  Republicans decided the only way to pass their program was to hide 
it. Let's reject it today.
