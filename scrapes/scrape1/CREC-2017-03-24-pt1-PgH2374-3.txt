               AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT IS A WAY FORWARD

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as we contemplate the American Health Care 
Act, here are a few things we do know:
  The Affordable Care Act, as it is called, has driven premiums for 
working families up and up each year. There are fewer choices of plans, 
especially in rural America, and 8 million and rising people are 
choosing not to opt to be enrolled at all, paying the penalty instead.
  Premiums will keep going up, as projected. Even more will drop out, 
and more will pay the penalty instead. More will become uninsured.
  This death spiral is not choice; it is not an American value.
  Mr. Speaker, as the American Health Care Act moves forward, we know 
the Democrats will not be helpful, as they are clinging to the failing 
ACA at all costs. We know that middle-income families are begging us 
for relief and more choices. We know this bill represents the best 
chance to achieve cost relief, actual choices, while also keeping the 
commitment under Medicaid to children in need with reauthorizing the 
bipartisan SCHIP later this year.
  More affordable options come about with unshackling what the ACA has 
wrought. It is this or that.
  Mr. Speaker, we must keep this dialogue, this option, this bill, the 
American Health Care Act, as a way forward to bring choices and relief 
to Americans who have worked for the American Dream and are feeling 
like they are losing it.
  Let's keep our pledge and help President Trump keep his pledge by 
taking this one of three important steps with the American Health Care 
Act.
