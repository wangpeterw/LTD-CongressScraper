                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of grace and goodness, thank You for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing of strength and perseverance that each Member 
might best serve their constituents and our entire Nation.
  May it be their purpose to see to the hopes of so many Americans, 
that they authenticate the grandeur and glory of the ideals and 
principles of our Republic with the work they do.
  Grant that the men and women of the people's House find the courage 
and wisdom to work together to forge solutions to the many needs of our 
Nation and ease the anxieties of so many.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
