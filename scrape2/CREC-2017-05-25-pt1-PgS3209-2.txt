                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``BILL'' AUSMUS

   Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing William ``Bill'' Ausmus of Hardin, a World War II 
Army veteran who celebrated his 100th birthday earlier this month. Bill 
has been involved with a variety of community organizations in Big Horn 
County for many years, helping countless Montanans along the way. His 
accomplishments are something we can all celebrate.
  After his World War II military service concluded, Bill spent almost 
seven decades serving in his local American Legion Post 8 and remained 
in an active capacity with the post into his nineties. His professional 
vocation was serving as the Big Horn County surveyor and, for a time, 
the assessor. These vital positions afforded him the opportunity to 
interact with and provide useful help to many in his local community. 
Bill developed a reputation for accuracy and customer service in his 
professional work. He was also integral in the formation of his local 
Methodist Church and is known for his volunteerism and generous 
donations to community projects and causes.
  The longevity of his many endeavors and willingness to help others 
along the way serves as an inspiration to us all. When looking back 
through the history of Big Horn County during the past century, it is 
clear that Bill has been key contributor. Congratulations, Bill, on 
your recent 100th birthday, and thank you for your service.
