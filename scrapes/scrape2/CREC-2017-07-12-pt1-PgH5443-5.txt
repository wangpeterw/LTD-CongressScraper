                  HONORING OUR COMMITMENT TO VETERANS

  (Mr. O'ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, there are tens of thousands of veterans in 
this country who have served this country; put their lives on the line, 
literally; and saved the lives of countless other servicemembers who, 
because of their service, have mental healthcare-related conditions 
like post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, which contributed to them 
having an other than honorable discharge.
  Mr. Speaker, with an other than honorable discharge, those veterans 
are unable to go into a VA and see a mental healthcare provider, 
despite the fact that they are more than two times likely to take their 
own lives.
  Now that we all know this, I hope that Members will join me in 
cosponsoring the Honor Our Commitment Act, which I introduced with Mike 
Bost in the House and Chris Murphy in the Senate. It is bipartisan and 
bicameral. It honors our commitment and obligation to those 
servicemembers who did right by this country, and it will save lives.
  I look forward to the full support of this Chamber, passage of this 
bill, and having the President sign it into law.
