                        DEMOCRACY IS IN JEOPARDY

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Judiciary Committee brought 
before the House a motion of inquiry that was introduced to seek 
answers to some of the issues concerning the firing of James Comey and 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions' role therein.
  Instead of passing that and dealing with issues that are fundamental 
to democracy and the respect our citizens may or may not have for its 
government, the Republicans put a substitute amendment in, raising all 
kinds of questions about Hillary Clinton.
  They did everything but yell: ``Lock her up.''
  It was a disgusting display of the majority taking advantage of the 
minority, squelching our voice, and taking the subject away from what 
is a serious issue concerning obstruction of justice and the potential 
obstruction of justice that could come about if there is an attempt to 
fire Mr. Mueller.
  Instead, they concentrated on old harangues about Hillary Clinton. It 
was not a good day for democracy.
  We need to be aware of the fact that our democracy is in jeopardy, 
and we need to be alert at every moment and try to find every answer.
