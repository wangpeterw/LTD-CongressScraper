                     DON'T MAKE AMERICA SICK AGAIN

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office 
estimated that 22 million Americans would lose theirhealth insurance if 
the Republican bill from last Congress becomes law. Let's don't make 
America sick again.
  There should be no repeal of health reform without an immediate, 
adequate replacement that achieves the same historic goalsin coverage, 
ensures people with preexisting conditions aren't blocked or priced out 
of the market, and that plans cover a basicset of benefits and consumer 
protections.
  Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in place will 
cause chaos. Millions will lose coverage; theindividual insurance 
market will be in shambles; doctors, hospitals, and States will lose 
billions; and the economy will behurt. Without health insurance, people 
with chronic diseases will lose care and become sicker.
  Every major law that Congress has passed needs oversight and revision 
to make sure it is as effective as intended. Congresscan amend any law, 
but doing so in a way that will cause 22 million of the newly insured 
people to be without health insuranceis just wrong.

  I urge my colleagues to stop working against the health of American 
people. We should not be making America sick again.
