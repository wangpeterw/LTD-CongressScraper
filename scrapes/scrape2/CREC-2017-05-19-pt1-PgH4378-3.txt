                   CONGRATULATING LEIGHTON DURHAM IV

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Leighton Durham 
IV of Dallas, Texas, as he and his family celebrate his selection as an 
Eagle Scout.
  The Boy Scouts of America has a long tradition of preparing young men 
for leadership, and the Eagle Scout award recognizes the highest rank 
within that program. Only 4 percent of Boy Scouts are granted this 
recognition, after a lengthy review process which includes the 
verification of 21 merit badges, a demonstrated Scout spirit, and a 
youth-led service project.
  For Leighton, his involvement in the service organization began when 
he was only 8 years old. Since then, the Boy Scouts program has helped 
foster a sense of service and leadership.
  This past year, as part of his Eagle Scout project, Leighton led 
efforts to refurbish a previously neglected classroom at the Tyler 
Street United Methodist Church in Oak Cliff. As a result of Leighton's 
project, the classroom is now in use for middle school youth.
  Please join me in congratulating Leighton in his latest achievement. 
I look forward to seeing his continued leadership in our community.
