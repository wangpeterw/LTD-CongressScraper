  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks 
on Monday, May 8, the Senate proceed to executive session for the 
consideration of Calendar No. 38, the nomination of Heather Wilson to

debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; and that 
following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on 
confirmation of the nomination; and that, if confirmed, the President 
be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
