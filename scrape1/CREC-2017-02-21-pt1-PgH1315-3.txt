                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Cara Spaccarelli, Christ Church Washington Parish, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  God of all the nations, You have called all people to lives of 
service. You have called all people to lives of peace and justice.
  We confess that sometimes we have cared more for lofty places than we 
have for places of service. We confess that sometimes we have worked 
more for power than for peace.
  Bless now those who gather in this place. Orient them to serve one 
another and our country towards the work of peace and justice for all. 
Grant them the wisdom, the vision, and the resilience that they need. 
And may this place be a sign of hope that we, Your people, can work 
together through many difficulties to bring about Your intentions for 
creation.
  Amen.
