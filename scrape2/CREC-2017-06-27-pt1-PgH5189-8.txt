                   BMW CREATES JOBS IN SOUTH CAROLINA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, I was 
grateful to be with Governor Carroll Campbell, Senator John Russell, 
and Senator Verne Smith when BMW held the groundbreaking for their 
first American manufacturing facility in the upstate of South Carolina.
  Today, with an investment of nearly $8 billion by BMW, South Carolina 
is the leading exporter of cars of any State, and the Greer plant is 
the largest BMW manufacturing facility in the world, with $9.5 billion 
worth of autos exported from the Port of Charleston last year. This 
fulfills the vision of the legendary industrialist, Roger Milliken.
  BMW has excelled by being a leader of apprenticeship training 
programs, creating over 30,000 jobs with ontime delivery of suppliers, 
and a total of 120,000 jobs nationwide.
  I was grateful to join Governor Henry McMaster; Senator Lindsey 
Graham; president of BMW, Knudt Flor; and chairman of the board, Harald 
Kruger, yesterday as BMW announced an additional expansion of $800 
million and 1,000 more jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Congratulations again yesterday on the swearing in of Congressman 
Ralph Norman, who is only the second Republican elected in 125 years 
from the Fifth District of South Carolina.
