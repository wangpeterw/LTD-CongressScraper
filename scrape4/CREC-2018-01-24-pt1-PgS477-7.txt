                  MARSHALL COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday morning, senseless violence 
struck the community of Benton in Western Kentucky. A shooting at 
Marshall County High School has claimed two lives, left more than a 
dozen injured, and thrust an entire community into shock and grief. 
Such a tragedy is every parent's worst nightmare. School should be a 
haven where students, faculty, and staff can learn and work without 
fear of violence.
  Elaine and I send our thoughts to the victims, their families and 
friends, and the entire Marshall County High School community.
  Last night, Kentuckians came together in more than 20 prayer vigils 
and services across the region. Although few of us can begin to 
understand their grief, an entire nation stands in solidarity at their 
side.
