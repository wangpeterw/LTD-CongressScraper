                 RECOGNIZING THE ST. PETE PRIDE PARADE

  (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the St. Pete Pride 
Parade for the significance to Pinellas County, Florida, and our LGBTQ 
community.
  Every June, for the past 15 years, the St. Pete Pride Parade has 
brightened the streets of my hometown, leaving joy, love, and equality 
in its wake. It has become one of the largest pride celebrations in the 
country, hosting over 200,000 attendees last year alone; all possible, 
thanks to our large, diverse LGBTQ community and city leadership that 
understands this community as a source of our strength.
  As we mark 1 year since the 49 souls were taken from us at the Pulse 
Nightclub in Orlando, this pride is much more than a celebration. It is 
a vibrant act of strength for a community that has endured persecution 
simply for being who they are and who they love.
  As St. Pete looks forward to the celebration this weekend, I wish the 
community happy pride. Be loud and be proud because we are proud of 
you.
