                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we seek Your blessings this day for our lawmakers. You 
know their hearts, their motives, and their needs. Lord, provide for 
their needs out of the abundance of Your riches in glory. Remind them 
that unless You provide Your guidance, they labor in vain. So guide 
them in what they propose to accomplish so that they will reap a 
bountiful harvest. Hold them with Your mighty hand until doubts and 
fears subside.
  We pray in Your wonderful Name. Amen.
