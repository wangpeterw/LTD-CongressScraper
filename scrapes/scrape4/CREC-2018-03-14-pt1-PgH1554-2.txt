                  HONORING HEROISM DURING WORLD WAR II

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Granville 
Crane of Gulfport, Mississippi, and the rest of the crew onboard the 
USS Indianapolis for their acts of heroism during World War II.
  The USS Indianapolis received secret orders in July of 1945 to 
proceed to Tinian Island, transiting the Pacific unaccompanied, 
carrying components of the Little Boy atomic bomb.
  Leaving Tinian, a Japanese submarine spotted the Indianapolis 
steaming towards Guam and fired two torpedos, striking and sinking the 
Indianapolis within 12 minutes. Approximately 300 crewmen went down 
with the ship, and the rest spent the next 3\1/2\ days in the water. Of 
the 1,200 crewmen, there were only 317 survivors.
  On behalf of Mr. Granville Crane and the rest of the USS Indianapolis 
crew, I encourage my fellow Members to support H.R. 4107, the USS 
Indianapolis Congressional Gold Medal Act, which honors the crew of the 
USS Indianapolis with Congressional Gold Medals for their important 
role and dedicated service to our country during World War II.
