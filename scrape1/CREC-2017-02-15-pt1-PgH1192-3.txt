                  GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN'S RESIGNATION

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for a nonpartisan, 
independent commission to immediately and thoroughly examine the 
influence in the 2016 election and at the Trump White House of the 
Russian Government. This House should have begun this critical 
oversight work immediately and served as a check on the White House to 
protect the American people, but it has failed to do so.
  The resignation of General Michael Flynn has raised far more 
questions than it answered, and it is not acceptable to simply sit on 
our hands or to say that somehow the only problem is the leaks that 
exposed this misconduct and not the misconduct itself. That won't cut 
it.
  The American people deserve to know the full picture of Russia's 
involvement in the election, of General Flynn's communication with 
Russian officials, and why President Trump took no action for weeks 
after learning of General Flynn's misconduct.
  Unfortunately, this administration's idea of transparency is 
conducting sensitive national security discussions in the middle of a 
crowded Mar-a-Lago dining room in full view of his wealthy patrons. The 
American people deserve better. They deserve an independent, 
nonpartisan commission, and it is time for this House to do its job.
