                   WELCOMING MINISTER JEREMIAH TATUM

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. 
Black) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome Minister Jeremiah 
Tatum from Cookeville, Tennessee, to our Nation's Capital.
  In Congress, we begin each day thanking the Lord for His provision

and asking for continued guidance, protection, and wisdom. It is a 
great privilege to have a fellow Tennesseean lead us in this sacred 
tradition today.
  Minister Tatum was born in Los Angeles County, California, and comes 
from seven consecutive generations of preachers. His call to ministry 
began 27 years ago, and he is currently serving his eighth year as the 
pulpit minister of Willow Avenue Church of Christ in Cookeville.
  In addition to local work, Minister Tatum preaches abroad and serves 
overseas with foreign missions. He encourages young men to become 
preachers and believes he has the best job in the world. Our community 
is so grateful for his service.
  He is married to Amber, and they have three children: Luke, Daniel, 
and LyssaBeth. I know his family and the Willow Avenue congregation are 
very proud to have him with us today, and I thank him for opening our 
day in prayer.
