                  THANKING ANDY LEUNG FOR HIS SERVICE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a 
very special member of my team, Andy Leung, who is an intern in my 
office.
  Andy comes to us through the Congressional Internship Program for 
Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. This is a unique program 
designed to give students with varying intellectual disabilities an 
opportunity to gain congressional work experience. It is part of George 
Mason University's LIFE Program. To date, 150 congressional offices 
from the House and Senate have participated in this wonderful program.
  Mr. Speaker, Andy is a part of our team, and we look forward to the 
hours he spends with us each week. He quickly settled into the office, 
and he is always in great spirits.
  Andy is hardworking and curious. He is interested in the projects the 
full-time staff are working on. He loves picking up the flags from the 
Capitol, and we are truly fortunate to have such a dedicated intern.
  I would like to thank Andy for his service and thank his employment 
assistant and the Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with 
Intellectual Disabilities for making this possible.
