               PASS A REAL BUDGET FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I represent 88,000 Federal workers in the 
Eighth Congressional District of Maryland who want to do their jobs for 
the American people.
  They are DREAMers, too, and they are doers. They work at NIH, NOAA, 
the National Cancer Institute, the Food and Drug Administration, the 
Department of Defense, and the State Department.
  My constituents and the people across the country who depend on them 
are in limbo because of the irresponsibility, the indolence, and the 
incompetence of President Trump, who called on his tweet machine for a 
``good shutdown'' of the American Government that he barely opened up 
in the first place.
  They worked overtime to get all of the Republicans behind their 
obscene tax break for the richest 1 percent of the country and foreign 
investors in Saudi Arabia, China, and the Cayman Islands, but they 
could not be bothered to pass a budget for the American people, which 
is our central constitutional function.
  They don't mind shutting down the government for the fifth time in 30 
years, as long as their big campaign donors get the huge legislative 
payoff they are waiting for.
  Let's do our job, and let's pass a real budget for the American 
people.
