                     GOP TAX BREAK FOR BILLIONAIRES

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, despite their best efforts, my Republican 
friends have not fooled the American people.
  They provided a modest, temporary tax cut for some Americans, but 
their tax bill raised taxes on 86 million middle class families. 
Eighty-three percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. It 
creates $2.3 trillion in debt and pays for it with deep cuts to 
Medicare and Medicaid.
  It also provides a huge tax break, $1.3 trillion, for the biggest 
corporations in this country and further incentivizes shipping American 
jobs overseas. Corporations have announced more than $200 billion in 
stock buybacks in just 3 months, more than 30 times what workers 
received.
  Corporations like Walmart and Pfizer, at the same time, are laying 
off thousands of workers as they pocket massive tax breaks for 
themselves, and we gave them incentives to ship more jobs overseas.
  Democrats want real bipartisan tax reform that starts with a real 
permanent tax break for the middle class that will produce better jobs 
and better wages for a better future. The American people deserve A 
Better Deal than this raw deal that they got from the Republicans in 
this tax bill.
