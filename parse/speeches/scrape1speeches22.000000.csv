He now believes, without any evidence to support his claim, that 3 to 5 million people voted fraudulently in the 2016 election.

7610,topic-id,617,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to support American Heart Association's Go Red for Women campaign.  The Go Red for Women campaign is an incredible public awareness initiative, spearheaded by the American Heart Association to promote heart-healthy lifestyles.  We have great results. Since Go Red for Women started in 2004, more than 627,000 women's lives have been saved, and I am so proud that I was an initiator and supporter of Go Red for Women in my great State of Ohio in the capital city of  Yes, we have made great progress, Mr.Speaker, but we still have a long way to go in helping to prevent cardiovascular disease, including stroke.  Cardiovascular diseases claim more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined, and it is just not women, Mr.That includes men, also. However, women do have a higher risk of stroke than their male counterparts.  In fact, 90 percent of all women have one or more risk factors for developing heart disease. Collectively, cardiovascular disease and stroke cause one in three women's death each year, killing approximately one woman every minute.                              {time}  1045  Yet, even with these eye-catching statistics, according to the American Heart Association, almost half of all the women, Mr.Speaker, are not aware of heart disease, and that it is the leading cause of death for women.  For African American women like me, the risk of heart disease is far greater. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for African American women, killing almost 50,000 annually. Of African American women ages 20 and older, 49 percent have heart disease, but only 1 in 5 African American women believe they are personally at risk.  Mr.Speaker, I was one of them. I suffered a cerebral brain stem stroke in 1999. But after my personal experience, I decided to do something about it. I decided to get more engaged, and I am so proud to say that I was appointed to serve on the American Heart Association Board, and at that time, I was the only non-healthcare professional or cardiovascular physician on the board.  That is why, Mr.Speaker, when I came to Congress, I decided that I would be engaged, and I became the co-chair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, where my colleagues and I work very hard to raise the awareness about the prevalence and the severity of cardiovascular disease.  Last Congress, Mr.Speaker, I introduced the Return to Work Awareness Act, which would assist survivors of stroke and other debilitating health occurrences to be able to return to work.  Mr.Speaker, I will always be an active participant in education and awareness. I will reintroduce that important piece of legislation this month, during American Heart Month, and I invite all my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to join me in sponsoring this piece of legislation.  This month, as we celebrate American Heart Month, let us recommit ourselves to becoming more educated about cardiovascular diseases, improving our heart health, and continuing to fight against this devastating disease.  Today, Mr.Speaker, I want the Nation to know that women will stand on the Capitol steps, and we will have our photo taken, all dressed in red, because we want to stand united to help educate this Nation, that if we stand together, maybe, just maybe, we can send a strong signal to America that we can fight against this disease.  I want to personally thank Nancy Brown for allowing me to serve with her on the Board, and welcome the new CEO, Steven Houser, and so many of the volunteers across this Nation and the leaders because we know, Mr.Speaker, that we need to recognize all Americans who are battling heart disease and express gratitude to all of them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH886.txt,2153,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,2.0,January
7462,topic-id,3441,"Mr.Speaker, this has been a fascinating 2 weeks here on Capitol We have had, last week, all night sessions in our Ways and Means Committee and on the Energy and Commerce Committee dealing with the Republican plan to dismantle the Affordable Care At times, Mr.Speaker, it is really hard to process all of the claims and counterclaims that are going on. I feel occasionally like I am in an alternative universe, and it is not just because we were up until 4:30 in the morning debating this.  People have lost track of how we got to this point--what was happening earlier, what has been the benefit and accomplishment of the Affordable Care Act, and what is going to happen moving forward were we to adopt a really disastrous proposal advanced by my Republican friends.  Twenty-five years ago, I was in a different role as Portland's commissioner of public works. And one of the elements in my portfolio for several years was to deal with personnel and benefits and health care. I am fully aware of trying to deal with our 6,000 employees to provide them with affordable health care that the city, as the employer, could afford, and that wasn't too burdensome on our employees. We were caught in a situation with rapidly escalating costs, inflation for medical care twice the rate of the ordinary inflation; we were having problems with employers maintaining coverage in an affordable fashion; and the individual market was, frankly, very chaotic and troublesome.  I have with me here a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation from March of 2009. They talked about these challenges--how the United States healthcare spending had risen from 1970 from 7.2 percent of the gross domestic product to where they projected that it was going to cost us by 2018, next year.[[Page H2144]]It would be $4.3 trillion, $13,100 per resident, and account for over 20 percent of the gross domestic product.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to say that, as a result of the unprecedented reforms that were incorporated in the Affordable Care Act, we were able to deal with this problem. We began 10 years ago, when Democrats gained control of Congress, working on expansion of the CHIP program, children's health, and it was one of the first actions signed into law by President Obama when he assumed office and we weren't facing a veto from the Bush administration.  We have been working for over 3 years trying to lay the foundation for moving forward with a comprehensive approach for healthcare reform. And it should be noted, for all of the hyperbole about socialized medicine and government dictating outcomes and taking control away from the American people, that is the furthest thing from the truth.  In fact, the program that was developed by President Obama and the Democrats, with no help from Republicans, was actually a middle ground. It relied upon the private insurance that most Americans had through work, and be able to expand that coverage, to be able to improve the quality of care, to be able to rein in medical inflation, to be able to deal with some of the most needy of us, and to be able to have a healthcare system that performed better.  The simple fact is we spend about twice as much as any other developed country in the world. And our outcomes, on average, are worse than what happens in those countries that my friends on the other side of the aisle derided--Canada, Great Britain, France, As a practical matter, those people get sick less often, they get well faster, they live longer, and they do so for a fraction of what we pay.  So what we did, through a very extensive process--multiple public hearings, meetings, seminars, position papers that were generated from a wide variety of areas--was to assemble a program to deal with that. One of the elements that drew the scorn of my Republican friends, and, in fact, is part of their repeal that is one of the centerpieces, is to repeal the mandate that people have health care.  It is ironic that that has become a target from Republicans because the mandate came from Republican alternatives to HillaryCare in the Clinton administration. In fact, 19 Republican Senators, including Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, supported a healthcare mandate to be able to expand and stabilize the health insurance market.  Well, what we have done through those 2 years that it was enacted, March 23, 2010--we are approaching the seventh anniversary--it went live in the fall and was fully in effect in 2014. So in the 3 years that the Affordable Care Act has been in place, it has had remarkable achievements.  You recall I mentioned what the studies showed that we were facing with rapidly escalating healthcare costs, where it was estimated that we would be having over 20 percent of the gross domestic product, we would be approaching over $13,100 per resident. Well, that didn't happen. Despite the dire predictions of the Republican opposition, healthcare costs did not skyrocket.  In fact, we anticipate now that instead of being over $13,000 per resident, it is under $10,000 after a couple years of operation of the Affordable Care Not over 20 percent of the gross domestic product, but 18 percent. We have found that these are the lowest rates of medical inflation since we have been keeping track.  The Affordable Care Act, by any stretch of the imagination, has been a success. We have seen coverage expand dramatically to the lowest rate of uninsured in the United States in our history while we have contained costs. That success is all the more remarkable because there has been a concerted effort on the part of the Republicans, from the moment they seized control of the House in 2011, to make it worse.  Bear in mind, the Republicans attacked the Affordable Care Act in court, on the floor of the House, and in terms of trying to muddy the waters on the State level. The Supreme Court challenge to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act failed. The Supreme Court decided that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional and would remain.  But the Supreme Court made a devastating decision that allowed individual States to opt out of Medicaid expansion. That was part of the program that was so important to be able to extend care on a cost-effective basis to some of the lowest income people in the country. Thirty-one States did. Nineteen States refused to do so. That undercut the coverage, made huge problems, created situations where there were people in the Republican-controlled States that refused to extend Medicaid, despite the fact that the Federal Government was paying for it, that we had people who were too poor to qualify for assistance. Shocking, embarrassing, and to the detriment of those States, they had much worse outcomes.  But it is ironic that some of the people who started attacking the Congressional Budget Office projections about the impact of the Republican plan pointed to the calculation on the part of the CBO that they underestimated the number of people who would be uninsured.                              {time}  1930  Well, that was precisely because there was no expectation that States would not expand Medicare, and if that unfortunate decision hadn't been made, we would, in fact, have seen them hit their target numbers.  Despite the claims of outrage on the Republican side that there would be employers dropping coverage for their employees en masse, we found that, in the main, employers retained coverage. Now, this is not the case going forward with the Republican proposal.  I think there was a reason why my Republican friends insisted on jamming this through the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee before we had a chance for the scorekeeper, the CBO, to give the results of their analysis: because they knew how bad it would look.  The CBO anticipates that there will be 14 million more uninsured Americans, including 2 million who will lose coverage provided by their employer because of the way their alternative tax credit for health insurance would be structured. In my State, it is estimated that as many as 465,000 Oregonians could lose coverage. The uninsured rate will triple in our  One of the areas that has been most successful with the Affordable Care Act has been for older They benefit from the protections against discrimination, and they are going to see a return to much higher premiums and higher costs.  The Republican plan would take the requirement that seniors pay no more than three times the rate of insurance for premiums for younger people, that will be five times greater. And instead of the subsidy that is based on income, there will just be a flat subsidy across the board. This means, in practice, that older Americans are going to face steeply higher premiums, and they are going to pay far more out-of-pocket because of the less generous subsidy.  One example that ought to get, I think, everybody's attention: In 2026, a 64-year-old with an income of about $26,500 would pay $14,600 for their health insurance as opposed to $1,700 today, an increase of almost $13,000.  Now, there are winners and losers under the Republican approach. The healthy, young people will catch a break, but older Americans will pay a lot more at precisely the time when they need health insurance.  Now, our Speaker appeared to be confused when he was describing the difference between the Republican approach and the Affordable Care Act, when he talked about how all of these people are being subsidized by the majority, who aren't sick. As many commentators rushed to point out to the Speaker, that is what insurance is about. Many people pay some to subsidize those who suffer loss. You pay a couple of hundred dollars a year for auto insurance so that, when you have a $10,000 loss, that is picked up by the people who don't suffer a loss but paid the premiums nonetheless.  Think about what the Republicans have put in place. They are doubling down on what the Trump administration has done trying to discredit the efficacy of the program, casting it in[[Page H2145]]doubt. The administration has already stopped enforcing the mandate.  The IRS is supposed to check and enforce to make sure that people sign up for the ACA and everybody is part of the insurance pool, just like States have mandatory auto insurance. You are not allowed to run the risk of harming your fellow motorists by not having insurance. That is widely accepted and understood that it is necessary to have the system work right.  Now the Republicans are increasing the damage that Trump has imposed, unilaterally, by not enforcing the mandate. They are going to repeal the mandate. In place of the mandate, they are going to have a 30 percent surcharge in case people drop coverage and decide to reenter the insurance pool.  Well, think about that for a moment. The people who are young, healthy, who feel invincible and don't have healthcare problems now are very likely not to get insurance at all. They figure that when they get sick, they can go ahead, pay the 30 percent premium. If they find out they have got cancer, some serious disease, then they can sign up later. It is designed to destabilize the insurance system that we have.  By the same token, we are looking at the other end of the spectrum where the people who are lower income, older, and sick are going to pay a disproportionate burden. That is why the CBO determined, in their analysis, that in 2026, actually, there will be a drop in terms of insurance premiums, in terms of the cost. They will start to go down. They will go down because older Americans will be unable to afford the premium. They will drop the coverage.  It is not that they don't need health care. It is not that they are going to somehow avoid becoming sick or having accidents, but they are not going to have insurance coverage. That means the care that many of them are going to experience will be what we were fighting against before the Affordable Care It will be in the emergency room. It will be when it is too late. It is not in a clinic before things get worse. It is after the fact, and it is in a setting that is not nearly as effective.  Mr.Speaker, it is really disappointing that part of the assault is on the Medicaid program itself. Medicaid is this program that provides care to the elderly, disabled, pregnant women, children, poor people. It is part of the bedrock safety net of this country. Republicans were against the expansion of Medicaid and making the qualifications to have Medicaid be more generous.  Under the Affordable Care Act, it is 138 percent of poverty, so lower and middle-income families are able to access this care. Prior to that, there were widely varying requirements across the country, and many of the States, particularly in the South, the States that declined to expand Medicaid, were facing really onerous restrictions--$10,000, $12,000, $7,000 family income--making it very, very hard and for only the most desperately poor to qualify for it.  Now, the Republican plan will eliminate the Medicaid expansion in its current form. It would cap Medicaid funding, and, ultimately, we are going to watch, reverting to what we had before--in effect, de facto rationing.  In Oregon, the Republican plan would shift $2.5 billion back to the States over the next 6 years. States are going to be left with impossible decisions: reducing benefits, cutting people off of  This is what has happened historically when people ran into difficult financial times in the They didn't raise taxes to make sure that the poor were provided coverage; they cut back coverage even more.  Sadly, under the Republican plan, 14 million Americans would lose Medicaid coverage by 2026, and it would start having its impact in less than 3 years.  The policy would also severely set back efforts to combat opioid addiction and improve mental health treatment.  In my community, as I visit health centers, find out what is going on in clinics, in local government, officials that deal with the homeless, the drug addicted, the mentally ill, we found that they are using the opportunity to enroll people in Medicaid to give them proper care and not put that burden on local governments that they simply can't cope with.  The Republican plan would prevent that. We won't be able to have people most in need provided with the mental health, the addiction services, the health care that they need.  The Republican plan would put 2.8 million people with substance disorders, including over 200,000--about 220,000 is the estimate that I have seen--with opioid disorders, at risk of losing their coverage, including the coverage of addiction treatment, continuing the tragic cycle that we see played out in our streets across the country, but particularly in Some of the areas that actually were most opposed to the Affordable Care Act have received the greatest benefit.  In a time of concern about budget deficits, repealing the Affordable Care taxes--which we approved in the Ways and Means Committee in the middle of the night last week--would create an immediate windfall tax cut for the highest American taxpayers. The Affordable Care Act was a balanced plan that actually reduced the deficit while it improved healthcare outcomes across the country.  This approach is going to provide--for example, the top 400 earners would see an average tax break of about $7 million a year, and people who are millionaires will be receiving tax cuts averaging $57,000 apiece; but, as it plays out, we will find taxes would raise significantly on about 7 million low- and moderate-income families.  Mr.Speaker, it also puts in jeopardy Medicare coverage for 57 million Americans by cutting the Medicare trust fund resources. Because of the total impact of what we have done with the Affordable Care Act, we have watched the Medicare trust fund have its life extended 2 years. The Republican tax proposal will cut $170 billion from the Medicare trust fund, moving it closer to being insolvent.  It is fascinating. Donald Trump promised not to touch Medicare or This plan violates both those promises. And as I had mentioned, the Trump promise that everybody would be covered under the Republican plan rings false. That is simply not the case.  Mr.Speaker, it was interesting, in the course of our deliberations, we received correspondence from the American Association of Retired They represent 38 million members in all 50 States, in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin It has a proven track record of being nonpartisan, a nationwide organization that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities for older They have a wide range of issues for which they have championed and gained notoriety; but, most significantly, we have watched them be involved with healthcare decisions, and they have been proven nonpartisan. In fact, I took issue with them when we were dealing with the Medicare part D prescription drug program in 2004.                              {time}  1945  It was unfortunate, I thought, that they kind of threw their weight to an inadequate program that was not paid for, that added to the deficit, and didn't do anything to fight to reduce prescription drug costs. But they made the judgment that this was the best they could do for the people they represented, and they didn't hesitate for a moment to work with Republicans to be able to enact that.  They wrote on March 7 to the chairs of our Energy and Commerce Committee and our Ways and Means Committee to express their opposition to the American Health Care They did so because it would weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability. They said it would dramatically increase the healthcare cost for Americans age 50 to 64 and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on Medicaid programs for long-term services, supports, and other benefits.  They have long fought to protect Medicare, and they pointed out in their correspondence that the 2016 Medicare trustee report said that the Medicare part A trust fund is solvent until 2028. This is 11 years longer than the projection immediately before the Affordable Care Because of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, we gained solvency, 11 years longer.  Now, they have serious concerns about the Health Care Act that repealed provisions that strengthen the[[Page H2146]]fiscal outlook, specifically the repeal of the .9 percent payroll tax on higher income workers. According to their analysis, this provision would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.  Think about it, Mr.Speaker, we are dramatically increasing the number of uninsured We are going to give them more expensive insurance of a lower quality. They will have higher deductibles and copays. At the same time, we are jeopardizing the future of Medicare, which so many American seniors rely upon.  They pointed out that about 6.1 million Americans age 50 to 64 purchase their insurance in the nongroup market, and that over half of them were eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage. They note the significant reduction in the number of uninsured since passage of the ACA, with the number of people in that age bracket dropping by half.  Yet, according to CBO, what is going to happen if the Republican plan is enacted, that that number is going to go back up again, it is going to be unaffordable for a number of seniors, and they are going to be paying a much higher cost.  Mr.Speaker, it is troubling that we are having a debate where we really have tried to discredit independent sources, where we have had no hearing dealing with the legislation that is rushing toward the House floor.  It is ironic that there was debate and discussion criticizing Democrats for the 3 years we spent developing the framework for moving the legislation forward. And after 6 years of my Republican friends being in power in the House, chipping away, undermining the Affordable Care Act, trying to make it worse, discrediting it, and voting over 60 times to repeal it, they do not have a plan in place to replace it.  Now, this is the best we can come up with. It is a program that is widely discredited.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2143-2.txt,99,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,16.0,January

But instead, Congress broke its promise to these miners and their families. Congress stolethe health care they had earned by passing a continuing resolution that failed to address the pension problem, and it stole thefunds that were still left in their health care plan to pay for a 4-month fix--4 months, 4 months. Who can make health caredecisions when you don't know if you will have health care coverage 4 months from now?  These working people don't deserve to live with this kind of uncertainty.

Keepin mind that at the bargaining table, workers will be willing to accept less wages today in exchange for health care andpensions in the future. That is what collective bargaining is often about. That is what is so important.  This is health care they sacrificed raises for. It was the health care we promised them. My colleagues know their stories ofhard work and sacrifice. We know these stories because over the past year, these miners traveled here by the busload. They rodelong distances. They gathered in the heat and in the cold for hours outside this building to make their voices heard.  They worked decades in the mines--hard back-breaking work. But that work had dignity. It was dangerous work--work where someof them were killed on the job, work where many of them developed health problems later. Many of them died younger than peoplewho dress like we do and have jobs like this. Their widows have been denied these pensions and health care. They clocked inevery day, these workers. They knew the conditions they faced. Many of them now suffer from black lung or other illnesses. Theyaccepted a lifetime of hard labor because they valued their jobs, they valued their work, and they believed that good-payingunion jobs were their tickets to the middle class.  These miners believed in the covenant we used to have in this country that promised if you work hard your whole life, if youput in the hours, if you save a little and do your part, you will be able to help your children go to college. They believedthat would give their kids a chance at a better life perhaps than they had. They believed that if they upheld their end of thedeal, if they put in the work to power our country by mining coal used for a generation of electricity, their government woulddo the same. In December, Congress told them they were wrong. I don't accept that. These workerssacrificed their lungs and their backs to keep our lights on. It is shameful that Congress, despite all intents and purposes,has stolen what they earned. These miners should have spent Christmas with their grandkids, not worrying about whether theycould afford their medicine.  We aren't giving up. We had a bipartisan solution in We will keep fighting until mine workers across Ohio and thiscountry have the full health care and retirement security that we promised them. They kept faith with us and powered ourcountry. It is time to keep faith with the workers in our industrial heartland and to right this wrong.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

7468,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Current Federal court rules allow trial lawyers to engage in picking their preferred venue. In particular, trial lawyers are able to file suit against the defendant in one State while keeping their case in a different State's court.  When a lawsuit is filed against a defendant in another State, trial lawyers may also sue a defendant in the State where they want the trial to occur. This keeps the case in the lawyers' preferred State court.  Many times the target of the lawsuit is a large, national business. But if the only defendant in the case is an out-of-State business, then the case can be heard in Federal court. Because of this, the trial lawyer will then also sue an innocent local individual or a small business in order to keep the case before a local court.  Usually, the case against the innocent local defendant is dropped once the case is safely back in State court, but it is dropped only after the innocent local defendant has spent time and money dealing with the lawsuit.  This practice is wrong. This practice perverts our justice system and causes needless pain. Trial lawyers should not have the power to subject innocent local individuals and small businesses to costly and time-consuming lawsuits just to rig the system. This kind of abuse of litigation is unjust and must be stopped.  A well-respected Federal appeals court judge, Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, has publicly supported Congress putting an end to this abuse. He has suggested that Congress provide judges greater leeway in making the proper decision on whether a case should be removed to Federal court. He has also suggested that Congress give Federal judges greater discretion to determine early on in a case whether a local party has been fraudulently sued. The Innocent Party Protection Act provides these exact changes.  In 2014 Judge Wilkinson addressed these proposals and said:       That is exactly the kind of approach to Federal      jurisdiction reform that I like because it is targeted.       And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as      it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to      establish that the joinder of a nondiverse local defendant is      totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever      recovering.  That is very hard to do.  So Judge Wilkinson went on:       So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit      more realistic appeals to me because it seems to me the kind      of intermediate step that addresses some real problems.  The legislation that this rule makes in order is the solution to the problem that Judge Wilkinson identifies. The underlying legislation would protect innocent local defendants in two main ways. First, the Innocent Party Protection Act allows Federal judges more leeway when determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a lawsuit for the purpose of keeping the case out of Federal court.  When a judge has a case before his or her court, the judge will have clear guidelines for determining whether the locality of a defendant can be disregarded in establishing whether the case will proceed in Federal or State court. However, this in no way infringes on our State court systems.  The judge must conclude that the defendant will not face a liability under applicable State law. Once that conclusion is reached, the judge then may release the innocent defendant from the case. This provision keeps legal claims in Federal Court that properly belong there by allowing Federal judges to decide whether a local party is truly a legitimate defendant and not simply ensnared in a case for the sole purpose of keeping the case in a trial lawyer-friendly State court. This is a fair and efficient solution to the problem.  Secondly, the Innocent Party Protection Act establishes a uniform approach for evaluating whether a plaintiff has a good-faith intention of seeking judgment against a local defendant.  While the U.Supreme Court has long recognized the right of courts to consider whether a plaintiff has a good-faith intention of seeking a judgment against a local defendant, the application of this principle has not been uniform.  The Innocent Party Protection Act simply codifies this longstanding principle and permits Federal judges to limit a lawsuit to the appropriate defendant.  Plaintiffs with legitimate claims against both a local and out-of-State defendant will be able to pursue their case in State court. However, if no legitimate claim exists, the out-of-State defendant will have the opportunity to have the case heard in a neutral forum. By codifying this principle, we effectively protect innocent individuals and small businesses from bad-faith litigation.  Mr.Speaker, the underlying legislation is a fair solution to one type of frivolous litigation. I support this effort, and I thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee for bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

7481,topic-id,1094,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  Mr.Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It provides for the consideration of the Innocent Party Protection  Mr.Speaker, we often speak of the Federal regulations or taxes inhibiting job growth in our country, but there are other headwinds that our Nation's job creators face as well. One of those headwinds is frivolous litigation.  I believe strongly that anyone and everyone should have access to justice. Everyone who is injured deserves to have their day in court, and they should have the opportunity to make their case. However, sometimes trial lawyers take advantage of our justice system and seek to gain an unfair advantage against a defendant. Trial lawyers may try to go court shopping in order to rig the case against the defendant.  One way they may seek to secure their preferred venue is to sue a perfectly innocent individual or a small business who happens to reside in the jurisdiction within which the trial lawyer desires to pursue the case. After some time, the innocent party is often released from the litigation, but not before incurring legal costs as well as emotional and opportunity costs. Each time an innocent small-business man or woman has to divert their attention from growing their business and divert resources away from investing in their employees and creating jobs and divert energy away from expanding their involvement in our communities, and instead they are forced to direct their attention toward defending themselves from a frivolous legal claim, each time this happens is a missed opportunity for creating jobs and for realizing economic growth.  The Innocent Party Protection Act defends our small-business men and women from bad faith lawsuits. It provides relief from trial lawyers who seek out friendly courts in order to pursue their cases. It balances the needs of justice with proper restraints on decidedly unjust actions. The Innocent Party Protection Act is a good and equitable solution. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our local businesses and defend them against frivolous lawsuits. Vote ``yes'' on the resolution. Vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill. Rein in this abuse of our justice system. I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Sessions for bringing this bill before us.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Hastings is as follows:          An Amendment to 175 Offered by Mr.Hastings       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      section:       2.

(a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill or      joint resolution proposing to repeal or amend the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the      Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of      2010 (PL 111-152), or part thereof, in the House, in the      Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, or in      the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means,      unless an easily searchable electronic estimate and      comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional      Budget Office is made available on a publicly available      website of the       (b) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order      that waives the application of paragraph (a).                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

7644,topic-id,2662,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying resolutions.  Before us is a resolution of disapproval that restores constitutional rights and empowers individuals with disabilities. Many of us know someone who struggles with a disability. We know friends or family who have mental challenges. We know these people, and we know they deserve the same constitutional protections as everyone else.  That is why this resolution is so important. It ends discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It restores due process rights. It keeps the Social Security Administration focused on its duty.  Mr.Speaker, the Obama administration's last-minute regulation to strip disability benefit recipients of their constitutional rights is deeply troubling.  The regulation at hand declares that just because an individual needs assistance in managing their disability benefits, they are also unfit to own a firearm. But this kind of thinking is discriminatory, forcing those with disabilities to choose between their constitutional rights or their disability benefits turns back the clock on disability rights.  This regulation singles out a single constitutional right to strip away from a group of It doesn't make sense.  Why take away one right and not others? Why not also strip those citizens of the right to vote or the right to trial by jury or the right to free speech?  In this country, your rights can't be limited without due process, but this regulation limits a constitutional right and only offers the recourse of appeal after the decision has been made. When it is easier to have your rights stripped away than to have them restored, it means your due process rights have also died in the process.  Mr.Speaker, this resolution restores the due process rights of individuals with disabilities. This resolution also refocuses the Social Security The agency's job is to administer benefits to Americans, not adjudicate cases concerning constitutional rights.  Mr.Speaker, I am also worried that this regulation will divert precious Social Security Administration resources from vital agency tasks. We trust the agency to fulfill our commitments to seniors and those with disabilities. This regulation distracts from those sacred promises.  I thank Mr.Johnson and my colleagues for their hard work on this resolution. We need to pass it.  Mr.Speaker, we also need to pass the joint resolution of disapproval for the Dodd-Frank section 1504 regulation. This resolution restores competitiveness to American energy companies. It allows American companies to comply with foreign and domestic laws, and it protects American workers abroad.  Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank requires companies to report their payments to our government or foreign governments related to oil, natural gas, and mineral extraction. After reporting this to the SEC, the agency publishes these disclosures. This process is costly and unfair to American businesses.  By forcing disclosure of project-level sensitive business information, American energy companies will face a disadvantage against government-owned energy companies. Since government-owned companies control three-quarters of the world's oil supply, this regulation could drastically impair the competitiveness of American companies. And the actual cost of compliance limit, estimated by the American Petroleum Institute to take 217,000 employee hours over a 3-year period, would be devastating.  Section 1504 must also be rolled back because it might force American companies to break the law of foreign countries. Some foreign nations prohibit the very disclosure requirements[[Page H832]]required by this SEC regulation. Our companies should not have to decide between following the rule of law here and following it abroad.  Finally, by forcing such detailed and specific disclosures to the public, section 1504 could make energy extraction sites prime targets for terrorists. Whether in the U.or abroad, we need to wisely protect American workers from terrorism and other threats.  Mr.Speaker, this resolution restores competitiveness to American companies, allowing them to contribute to the global energy economy in a safe, secure, and legal manner.  It is time for Congress to reassert its authority and fix this poorly implemented legislation.  I commend the work done by Representative Huizenga and my colleagues on this important resolution, and I urge its passage.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck) for extending me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, we are only one month into 2017; and today we have another closed rule or, as I call them now, Putin rules. This is the kind of process they have in Russia: no amendments, no debate, no nothing, completely shut down. It is your way or the highway.  This is not the way the United States House of Representatives, the greatest deliberative body in the world, should be run. This is shameful. I have very serious concerns about the road that we are traveling down, Mr. The 115th Congress is only a few weeks old, and we have already ushered in a process that is alarmingly restrictive. Sadly, it has become routine in this Republican House for the majority to close down the process, rush bills through the House without regular order, enforce the rules for Democrats but not for Republicans, and insist on spending all of our time on partisan legislation instead of working together to find bipartisan compromises and solutions to the real problems facing American families and workers.  Mr.Speaker, today's legislation makes clear that the Republicans are eager to repeal protections put in place to help the American people. We should be working to expand opportunity for hardworking families and strengthen safeguards to put the American people first, not corporations, not wealthy CEOs, not big donors, and not special interests, but the people ought to come first.                              {time}  1230  Today is another sad day. We are engaged in what I would call mindless legislating. While my Republican friends say they want to repeal needless regulation--something that we all want to do--the process my Republican friends have embraced, to put it gently, is reckless. No matter what you think of a particular regulation, or rule--or, in many cases, they are protections--no matter what you may think of a particular regulation, there is no denying that these rules that my Republican friends are bringing to the floor to repeal went through a vigorous process that took months and months, and even years to complete.  They went through agency review. They went through a lengthy comment period, oftentimes thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people weighed in on the pros and cons of a particular idea. But the idea that we would just erase them with the blink of an eye, no hearings, no markups, nothing, it is a mindless way to legislate and a disturbing way to govern.  The ``act first and think later'' approach was on full display with President Trump's Muslim ban. It was so hastily enacted that his own Secretary of Homeland Security didn't even know that the President was signing the executive order until he saw it on cable news. The Trump White House did such a poor job of briefing the Federal agencies charged with enforcing the policy that airports across the country were caught completely off guard, and there was widespread confusion and chaos about how to carry it out.  That is what happens when you don't embrace a process that is thoughtful. You get confusion, you get chaos, and you usually get bad policy.  The mindless approach to governing by Republicans continued this week. On Monday, President Trump announced that, for every new regulation passed, two regulations must be repealed. That is it. No details on what kind of regulations would be repealed, or why they would be repealed. This is a blind shotgun and arbitrary approach to our Nation's laws. We shouldn't be dumbing down the way we govern. The American people deserve better from their leaders in Congress, and I think they deserve better from their leaders in the White  Now, when this legislation came before the Rules Committee the other night, there were plenty of questions. The hearing went on for a long time. Lots of the questions came from my Republican friends. And I will tell you, the chairman's answers were not always that enlightening. I think maybe some more hearings would have helped. But in response to some of these objections, namely, did the bill undergo any review by a committee, one of my Republican friends--and it may have been the gentleman from Colorado--said: We don't have time. We don't have time for hearings. We have so many regulations that we want to repeal.  Don't have the time for a hearing? Don't have the time to understand what we are doing? I thought that was part of our job. We were supposed to deliberate. We were supposed to read the bill. We were supposed to understand the impact of the actions that we may or may not take in this That is our job.  The American people have given us the responsibility to take the time to do our job right and to carefully consider the laws we pass. To say that we don't have time for hearings and deliberation--never mind, we don't have time to allow an open process where people might want to offer amendments--is ridiculous. It is shameful. And I will tell my Republican friends, stand up to your leadership on this. This is not the way this House should be run.  So as we consider the repeal of the NICS rule, we should remember that Congress has failed to take any meaningful action on gun violence at all. We have massacres on a regular basis in this country. All we do is we have a moment of silence. That is our response. We have a high rate of suicides in this country due to gun violence. It is something we ought to talk about. And I think that the NICS rule is a commonsense, responsible gun safety measure that could potentially save the lives of thousands of people in this country. I think Congress has the responsibility to keep our families safe, not remove safeguards that help prevent gun violence.  Far too many have lost their lives to preventable gun violence. This rule is intended to keep firearms out of the hands of those suffering from severe mental illness. That is a commonsense idea that I think we all should agree on. In 2007, President George Bush signed a bipartisan bill to identify individuals ineligible to possess firearms because of severe mental health issues. This rule allows for a reporting method to ensure that the law is implemented effectively.  It is intended to save lives. Every year in the United States, more than 21,000 people kill themselves, and mental illness is also an important factor. A gun is used in the majority of these cases. The people listed on NICS are the 75,000 dealing with the most severe mental illnesses. These are people who need help, not access to a dangerous weapon like a gun.  I think this rule is a critical step, but we must close the online gun show loopholes, and we must ensure universal background checks. I think we ought to bring to the floor a bill that says that if the FBI and our security agencies have put you on a terrorist watch list and think that you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane, then you ought not to be able to go out and buy a gun.  But under the way this House is run, we can't even bring those things to the floor for a debate. The Republican leadership and the Republican Rules Committee blocks it so that there can't be real deliberation on the House floor.  When people ask me all the time, Why can't you have a debate on this, or why can't you have a vote on it, I have to explain that the House Rules Committee, run by nine Republicans, says[[Page H833]]no to everything, says no to every idea that they don't absolutely embrace. And that is not the way Congress should be run.  Mr.Speaker, even if you disagree with me on the value of this rule, I think it is an important enough issue that there ought to have been a hearing. There ought to have been that opportunity to deliberate and to talk about it and what the impacts are. But no, nothing. We don't have the time. So here we are.  Mr.Speaker, the other bill before us is a naked attempt by Republicans to undo anticorruption rules. The rule that they are so upset about would require energy companies on the U.stock exchange to disclose payments they make to foreign governments for access to their natural resources.  Now, there are reasons for this. It is important that there be transparency. We heard all about the plans to drain the swamp, but President Trump and the Republicans are doing all they can to turn the swamp into a cesspool.  Putting aside all of his conflicts of interest that, I think, are on a collision course with corruption, I mean, repealing things like this, is just a bad idea. The Republicans in Congress are trying to roll back regulations like this one that are aimed at increasing transparency and fighting corruption.  ExxonMobil heavily lobbied against this rule. And now, with former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on the cusp of becoming our country's new Secretary of State, Republicans are proposing to kill this anticorruption rule that benefits Big That is reckless, and it is irresponsible.  When this rule was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank bill in 2010, the Big Oil lobbies strongly fought against it in court, but Congress fought back to assert America's traditional role as a global leader in fighting corruption. American leadership delivered results. The European Union promptly moved to enact nearly identical legislation, as did Canada with support of its global mining companies.  But now, Big Oil is back seeking repeal of the rule so their payments can be kept secret from the American people. They claim they will be at a competitive disadvantage to foreigners, or they will have to reveal commercially sensitive information.  But with Europe and Canada in the same disclosure system, the playing field is now level and the companies already filing have suffered no commercial harm, nor revealed vital secrets. The fact is, this won't cost a single American job, and the only thing oil companies will need to do differently is report their numbers.  Aside from Big Oil, those most eager to repeal this rule are autocrats in places like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela--with oil wells, gas fields, or copper mines--who want to keep the money secret from their citizens. Why should we do their bidding? Why should we be in league with them?  On top of that, this rule is our most affordable and effective way to fight corruption abroad. We cannot afford to betray our own principles and severely undercut our allies in Europe and It would cost countless lives over the long run and endanger our security. We need to put American interests first, ahead of the special interests, ahead of the corporate interests, and retain that important rule.  Obviously, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the repeal of these two rules, but you got to do what you got to do. But I urge you to vote ``no'' on this rule.  And I ask you to vote ``no'' because it should be a principle vote.  This place is becoming so closed up, so restrictive, that this is not a deliberative body anymore. We are not talking about things anymore. It is basically whatever the leadership wants, whatever Donald Trump wants, you bring to the floor, rubber stamp it, and that is it.  I don't care what political party you are in, nobody who got elected by the people of this country should stand for that kind of process.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

7645,topic-id,592,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts raising the issue of a thoughtful process and whether this legislation was rushed to the floor.  I think it is worth noting that the original legislation, which this rule seeks to amend, became law in a time when my colleague was in the House and his party was in the majority. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was introduced in the House on June 11, 2007.  The bill was moved by Congressman Conyers under suspension of the rules and passed by the House on June 13, 2007. There was no markup in the Judiciary There was no meaningful debate on the floor. The bill was rammed through the House in 3 days without any thought to the potential consequences of its passage. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent.  I did not see others standing up to leadership at that point in time. In its implementation, we are seeing the consequences. They involve the stripping away of constitutional rights and due process rights. They involve the elimination of due process rights. They involve discrimination against individuals with disabilities.  As for the point that this rule that we are now debating somehow encourages corruption, the fact is that this regulation puts U.companies at a competitive disadvantage to state-owned entities abroad that are not subject to SEC regulation.  Additionally, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs for U.businesses. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act already prohibits bribes to foreign governments to obtain or retain business. These are legitimate payments being made to foreign governments, the payments that we are discussing here, and we should still prosecute any corruption to the full extent of the law.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  With regard to the NICS bill, I have a very different version of history than the gentleman does, including one that represents a bipartisan compromise with the Bush White  So I have a very, very different recollection of history than he does on that. And on the other bill, it is all about corruption, and it is all about giving Big Oil what they want.  At the end of the day, the two interests that are most happy with the repeal of this rule are Big Oil and And if that is where we believe that we ought to be using our energy to help then go ahead and vote to repeal it. But again, I think that this process speaks for itself.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question, and, if they do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Lofgren's bill to overturn and defund President Trump's immoral, unconstitutional, and discriminatory executive order banning Syrian refugees and suspending immigration from certain countries.  President Trump's executive order flies in the face of our Nation's values. It compromises our national security by providing terrorist groups with a recruiting tool. This executive order needs to be overturned, and, if we defeat the previous question, we will bring up legislation to do just that.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

All told, in fiscal year 2015, there were roughly 1,000 Federal advisory committees, and they heldroughly 7,400 meetings at a cost to the American taxpayers of more than $369 million. Now, this strikes me personally as anexceptionally high number. It is a large amount of money. We need to learn more about them, and I personally would help championto reduce the number of overall Federal advisory committees.  We have some 2 million Federal employees, I think, who arehighly capable, motivated, and compensated to provide this work. It is good to get outside perspective; but, at some point, weare going to have to look at the cost, the size, and the scope of this as well. Nevertheless, we have to make sure that we aregetting the most of these taxpayer dollars.  Some agencies believe the FACA requirements are cumbersome and resourceintensive. We could certainly streamline this. This reduces the ability of committees to focus on substantive issues in a timelyfashion.  Both governmental agencies and private groups say the 1972 act does not do enough to require agencies to promoteopenness and transparency with regard to Federal advisory committees. The bill works to address these problems and bringtransparency to the Federal advisory committees and the Federal agency decisionmaking process.  The bill provides neededtransparency for how committee members are selected in several ways. First, the bill requires members to be selected withoutpolitical affiliation. The bill also authorizes agency heads to require members to fully disclose any conflicts of interest. Youwould think that that would be common sense but something that we actually need to put into this bill and make sure that weunderstand that.  In addition, the bill allows these individuals who regularly attend and participate in committee meetingsto be considered as a member, even if they are not allowed to vote.  The bill also improves transparency of committeeactivities. This is done by increasing the independence of these committees and making sure its advice, information, andrecommendations are a judgment of the committee and not the agency.[[Page H70]]  The bill alsoincreases transparency by requiring each agency to make available on their Web site the committee and its activities.  I urgeour Members to support this. It has wide support and has had it in the Oversight and Government Reform I urge itspassage. I again thank Mr.Clay, Mr.Connolly, and others who were working on this issue.  I reserve the balance ofmy time.

We want to ensure the Federal Government remains a competitive employment option. We also want to make sure, particularly at the VA, that the department has the necessary data to make smart hiring decisions and ensure important positions are filled.  This bill will allow technical experts to earn promotions without having to necessarily go into the management track, which is very important. For some of the skill sets, you don't have to be in management if you are providing a skill that is so imperative to making sure we take care of our veterans.  The bill also allows for a fast-tracked reemployment of former VA employees who have a proven record of success at the agency. We get some people trained up, maybe they go and do something else, we ought to give the people priorities in coming back as well, to make sure that we have the most qualified Federal workers who are taking care of the people who have taken care of us.

I certainly appreciate it, and I am sure it will make the Federal Government run more efficiently.  I rise instrong support of the Federal Advisory Committee Act I have introduced this bill in previous Congresses, and itpassed the House last year without opposition.  The FACA was originally enacted in 1972. It is intended to ensure thatcommittees that provide advice to Federal agencies and the President operate with transparency.  Advisory committees providethe government with recommendations on a wide range of issues. For example, the EPA relies on the expertise of the Clean AirScientific Advisory Committee to provide technical advice on setting national air quality standards.  The bill we areconsidering today would strengthen FACA to make Federal advisory committees more transparent and to make agencies moreaccountable in how they select and use these committees. Agencies currently can avoid the requirements of FACA by conductingadvisory committee business through subcommittees. This bill makes it clear that FACA applies to subcommittees as well as parentcommittees.  The bill also clarifies that a committee set up by a contractor is subject to FACA if it is formed underdirection of the President or an agency.  Under FACA, agencies would be required to disclose how advisory members are chosen,whether they have financial conflicts of interest if they are appointed to provide their own expertise, and who they work for ifthey are representing a specific interest.

7424,topic-id,427,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.Clay) for his leadership on this veryimportant piece of legislation. I also thank the distinguished chairman of our full committee for his leadership in moving thisthrough.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2017, I think, fall under the umbrella of good government, whichthe Oversight and Government Reform Committee, at its best, strives to promote on a bipartisan basis. I am proud, as Mr.Clay indicated, to be an original cosponsor of the bill.  We welcome consideration of the Federal Advisory Committee ActAmendments, which would improve the transparency and accountability of Federal advisory committees, often arcane, Byzantineparts of the government most of the public can't access.  This crucial piece of legislation ensures that the selectionprocess of advisory committee members takes place without regard to political affiliation and requires the disclosure ofpotential conflicts of interest.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act, FACA, enacted on October 6, 1972, formalized theprocess for establishing, operating, overseeing, and terminating Federal advisory committees. Federal advisory committeesprovide a mechanism for government officials to gain knowledge from Federal and non-Federal experts on key policy matters. FACAensures Federal advisory committees, however, are both transparent and accessible.  FACA was enacted in response to concernsthat Federal advisory committees were becoming increasingly common but had little oversight or accountability. The then-HouseCommittee on Government Operations listened to concerns over the lack of transparency and formalized a governance process forthese advisory bodies by establishing the Committee Management Secretariat within the General Services Administration to monitorcompliance with the new law. The intent of that law was to make Federal advisory committees more accountable, more transparent,balanced, and independent from the influence of special interests.  This bill before us today, inspired by Mr.Lacy'sleadership, will help strengthen the independence of those advisory committees by requiring members to be selected withoutregard to partisan affiliation. It is imperative that the recommendations and guidance of the committees be provided free ofpolitical influence, pressure, and intervention.  The bill closes the loophole that allows subcommittees to operate outsideof the regulations of It also improves the transparency of advisory committees by requiring agency heads to obtainconflict of interest disclosures from all committee members serving as individual experts.  H.2347 builds upon theaccountability of the advisory committees by explicitly stating that committees established by contractors must comply with thelaw and that individuals who regularly attend and participate as if they are members are considered members regardless of theirability to vote.  This bill also calls on the Government Accountability Office to review and report regularly on agencycompliance.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Byrne). The time of the gentleman has expired.

7704,topic-id,2392,"Mr.President, there has been a flurry of activity this week with the beginning of the new year and thebeginning of a new Congress--the 115th Congress--and we have a lot of work to do.  This election that we just went through on November 8 was surprising in many ways, gratifying in many ways. Personally, Ithink the best thing about it is that it gives us an opportunity to start anew, to deal with the problems that the Americanpeople were, frankly, not all that happy with either of the political parties about in terms of the solutions that we were tooffer. I would hope that it would also give us an opportunity to hit the reset button when it comes to working together to tryto find political consensus to solve some of these big problems.  I mentioned yesterday our friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and his 80-20 rule, which I told him I have usedtime and again to make the point that just because you disagree on some things doesn't mean you can't get[[Page S35]]anything done. Tothe contrary, people of widely divergent ideological, philosophical, and political beliefs can work together by simply trying tofind common ground. That is possible. That, in fact, is the way our Constitution created our government to force us to do that,because what we decide here impacts a lot of people--well over 300 million people in the United States alone. But if there wasone consistent complaint that I heard from my constituents back in Texas and that we heard in the national media and beyond, itis about the failure of the promise of We made a solemn commitment to the American people that if they provided uswith the majority we needed to do it and if they provided us a President who would sign it, we would repeal ObamaCare and wewould replace it with affordable health care that would be of their choosing, as opposed to a top-down mandate, a one-size-fits-all, which is the failure of  In a previous life, I was attorney general of my State, the State of We had a huge division of trial lawyers calledthe consumer protection division. What we did is we sued people who committed consumer fraud--people who promised one thing butdelivered another. I can't think of a bigger case of consumer fraud than ObamaCare, which was sold under false pretenses: If youlike what you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you are a family of four, yourpremiums will go down by an average of $2,500.  None of that has proven to be true.  The reason why ObamaCare is so unpopular is that people have seen their premiums skyrocket. People have seen theirdeductibles grow to the point where they are effectively self-insured, which is not having insurance at all. Many people havesimply seen insurance companies pull out of the insurance market, leaving them with little or no choices in terms of where tobuy their health care.  So many remember the PR campaign of the President and Democrats, with which they sold ObamaCare to the American people, and,as I said, promised better coverage, more choices, and lower prices.  That means now that ObamaCare has failed to deliver that. It is incumbent on us to try to repeal it, which we will do, andto replace it with more affordable coverage that people will choose and that fits their needs better. The bad news of ObamaCarepicked up throughout last summer into the fall. As I mentioned, insurance companies were losing money and were unable to operateand deliver health care under the tight grip of But the real losers weren't the insurance companies. It is the tensof thousands of Texans who were forced to find new insurance at higher prices--not insurance they would have chosen on their own,but which they were forced to accept because there was no alternative.  So instead of helping rural Texans--the Senator from Vermont talked about rural residents in his State--I would submit thatfor people living in rural areas across the country, the implementation of ObamaCare hurt most of our rural country by dwindlingthe number of choices to one health care option for the year. That sounds like the opposite of more choices and better coverageto me. But we can't forget that behind these numbers and headlines are real personal consequences for families across thecountry.  So today I want to provide just a snapshot of some of the thousands of letters that I received in my office about ObamaCareand the burdens that it is placing on the backs of the people I represent in One Texan wrote telling the story that Ihave heard time and again. She said her insurance plan was discontinued--so much for ``if you like what you have, you can keepit.'' But she did what she had to do, and she switched to a more expensive plan--one with a higher monthly payment and one withan $11,000 deductible. What good is health insurance if you have to spend $11,000 out of your own pocket before the insurancebegins to kick in? It is nearly worthless.  Well, nothing about that says affordable health care. Unfortunately, this individual is like many folks across the country,full of questions and with nowhere to turn to find any relief for their families or their small business.  Another one of my constituents had a similar complaint. He wrote to me that he was searching for yet another healthinsurance plan for the third time in as many years after his was canceled. He went on to highlight this in this letter, which Ireceived from a constituent on November 23, 2015. He said:       I seem to remember the President sayingsomething about      liking your insurance and being able to keep it. For myself      and my family, it has been just the opposite. Weloved our      insurance prior to the passage of the Act and since have been      forced to purchase much more expensive insurance withmuch      higher deductibles.  Well, this Texan is right, but unfortunately, his experience was not isolated. It was shared by millions of people acrossthe country for whom ObamaCare was a false promise. It is not as if he had the freedom to choose. The choice was made for him,and this was the fundamental flaw of In a country as big and diverse as ours, this notion of ``one-size-fits-all''and that somehow the people who live and work inside the beltway are smarter than the rest of us and we can figure out what isgood for them and a choice they would not themselves make is just simply implausible. It is not true. This constituent ended hisletter by asking the Congress:       Do anything. Do anything within your power to reverse this      terriblehealth care trend. I need relief.  After this historic election, after the promises we made that have given us the opportunity to govern in the majority, witha President in the White House who will work with us, I believe we have a clear mandate to repeal this terrible law and make ita relic of the past. We will do that by adopting the budget resolution submitted by Chairman Enzi of the Budget  It is not just Republicans who have pointed out the defects of Many of our Democratic colleagues have pointed outthe law's failed promises as well--from an op-ed entitled ``How to fix the Affordable Health Care Act,'' which was written by aDemocrat, to statements on the Senate floor, to legislation introduced to ``fix the glitch.''

I, for one, would be happy to start with her list and say let's try to use this as a core of issues that we can thentry to build consensus around to begin to make that replacement and make it on a bipartisan basis.  We have seen that attempted fixes, unsupported by the Obama administration and vastly insufficient, continually have beenmet with frustration by Democrats and I pointed out yesterday that when the Democrats voted through ObamaCare, theyhad 60 votes. They had 60 Today they have 48.  At one point, certainly back in 2009 and 2010 when ObamaCare passed, they had a majority in the House of Representatives.Well, they lost that. Now they have lost the White House itself. I just don't know how much longer, how much more needs to besaid or done for them to get the message that this is not working because I believe they are paying a political price for it aspeople are searching for accountability for what they have to deal with day in and day out.  The senior Senator from Indiana said that he supported the Affordable Care Act to help working and middle-class familieshave access to health care, but he said that doesn't mean the law is perfect, and it doesn't mean we don't still have work todo.  I was delighted to hear the Senator from Vermont, Mr.Sanders, say he agrees ObamaCare is not perfect. My request ofhim and others is to work with us to try to replace it with something better.  I recognize that neither side is going to be able to get everything they want. That is just not the way this place works.Indeed, the single failure of the Obama administration is to try to do things on a go-it-alone basis because we are going to seethose Executive orders that he issued unilaterally rescinded on the first day President-Elect Trump takes office. All themassive regulations that have been issued, we are going to use the Congressional[[Page S36]]Review Act to rein those in or to defundthose through the appropriations process. In order for legislation and policy to be sustainable, it is going to have to bebipartisan. I realize our Democratic colleagues are disappointed with the outcome of the election on November 8. That is anunderstatement. At first they started out in denial: It just can't be true. The next stage was met with anger. Well, they areangry about it, and they are going to obstruct everything the new majority, working with the White House, tries to do, but Iwould hope they would move past that denial and past that anger and do what the Senate was always designed to do; that is, towork on a bipartisan basis, as our friend and colleague from Wyoming demonstrated to us working on the Health, Education, Labor,and Pensions Committee with the liberal lion of the Senate, Teddy Let's try the 80-20 rule and see how it works. Itwill work.  The senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr.Manchin--this is another Democrat--has said he would vote to repeal ObamaCare.He said that we should be working together to identify which parts of the law are broken and need to be fixed. We may learn thatsome parts of the law can't be repaired and we should eliminate those parts entirely. This is our Democratic friend andcolleague from West Virginia, Senator  I think that is a great place to start because no matter which side of the aisle you sit on, you can see the Affordable CareAct is not working, certainly not as sold to the American people. The choice of the Democrats now is whether to obstruct orwhether they will actually work with us, as we should have done in the first place, to come up with something more sustainablethat would address costs and preserve individual choice.  It is interesting. It is not just our Democratic colleagues, many of whom voted for I remember during thePresidential campaign that former President Bill Clinton made some pretty interesting comments. This would have been on October5, 2016. I am reading from a CNN story here. It said:       Speaking at a Democratic rally in Flint,Michigan, the      former president ripped the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for      flooding the health care insurance market and causingpremiums      to rise for middle-class Americans who do not qualify for      subsidies.  Here is what he said:       So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25      million morepeople have health care and then the people who      are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up      with their premiumsdoubled and their coverage cut in half.      It's the craziest thing in the world.  Former President Bill Clinton said that in Flint, MI, on October 5, 2016.  He is right, but that is what you get when you try to do things in a partisan, unilateral fashion. We should learn from ourcollective mistakes and try to do better, and shame on us if we can't do better than ObamaCare with all of its failed promises.  By repealing ObamaCare, Congress is doing more than just delivering on a promise we made to the people who put us here. Weare providing a way forward for millions of people across the country who have been hurt by ObamaCare and are looking forrelief.  I look forward to making ObamaCare and the many burdens it has placed on American families a thing of the past in this newyear. That is what we will do when next week we pass this budget resolution, and then reconciliation instructions will be sentto the relevant Senate and House committees. They will then report back with the replacement, and, yes, it may take some time totransition into that replacement because it has taken us 6 years to get into the mess, into the ditch we find ourselves in now.When your truck or car is in the ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch. Sometimes that takes a lot ofhard work.  We are going to have to work as hard as we can. I would hope our colleagues will work with us, not just to resist forresistance's sake, not just to take a partisan position because they feel they are required to do so because of their allegianceto the policies of the Democratic Let's do what this institution has always been best known for; that is, to try to findsome way to work together on a step-by-step basis to produce reform which will make health care more affordable and stillpreserve those choices for individuals and their families, not a one-size-fits-all government mandate which simply has failed inthis tragic experiment known as We can and we will do better.

The year 2015 went on record as the year with most threats, reports of harassments, and vandalism against mosques in the United  In light of the emboldened White nationalist, anti-Semitic, and antigovernment movements, as well as ongoing threats from abroad, we must ensure that our first responders are prepared to respond to the evolving threats to our great country.  This bill will direct FEMA's national exercise program to design scenarios that include emerging terrorist threats. To be clear, the legislation does not require FEMA's national exercise program to focus exclusively on terrorist threats, but, rather, seeks to ensure that FEMA continues to develop exercises that are responsive to threats as they may emerge.  The bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out exercises related to terrorist threats domestically and abroad.  H.1302 was passed unanimously and approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month and the full House in the last Congress, in July 2016.  Mr.Speaker, H.1302 is commonsense legislation that will prepare first responders, as well as State and local government partners, for the challenges that lie ahead.  At this time, when first responder programs are slated for the chopping block under the administration's budget blueprint, it is more important than ever that Congress stand together to support them. Exercises like the ones authorized under this legislation contribute to our preparedness.  As such, I urge Members to support this bill once again.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

7683,topic-id,1792,"Mr.President, November 8, 2016, was not just election day. It was a day that will live in cyber infamy because it turns out that one of the leading enemies of the United States, the nation of Russia, was directly engaged in the Presidential campaign that resulted in the election on November 8. This is not speculation. It is a fact based on conclusions that came from 17 different intelligence agencies that confirmed this reality. This is the first time we can point to where a foreign power has tried to influence the outcome of a Presidential election in the United Their goal was clear: to elect Donald Trump, to defeat Hillary They hacked into computers. They released information on a selective basis. They created fake news stories. They used WikiLeaks--everything within their cyber power to influence the outcome of the election. That was the reality.  This morning we were awakened to the headline that President Trump's head of the National Security Council, LTG Michael Flynn, has resigned. That is an incredible blockbuster of a story. And what was the reason for his resignation? It turns out that he had a direct conversation with the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Mr.Kislyak, and that conversation included references to sanctions that President Obama was imposing on Russia because of their involvement in our election. What led to his resignation, of course, was that he misled both the Vice President and the President about that conversation. When the facts came out, he was forced to resign.  This is not business as usual in What we are dealing with here is, in fact, a historic event--a powder keg in history--when it comes to the United States and its security. The obvious question is, Will this Congress of the United States, this branch of our government, respond? Will we initiate thorough investigations as to the involvement of the Russians in that election campaign and, specifically, any involvement with any Presidential campaign during that time?  Twenty years ago, when I was elected to the Senate, there was an investigation initiated by the Republicans at the suggestion--the suggestion--that the Chinese Government played some role in the Clinton-Gore campaign. The Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate was entrusted with the responsibility to do a thorough investigation of that allegation, and Fred Thompson, the Senator from Tennessee, was the chairman of that committee, with John Glenn as the ranking  The hearings went on for weeks--ultimately, for months--and then there was a formal report issued. No credible evidence was found of the suggestion, but it was taken that seriously by the Republican-led Congress that the Chinese may have been involved in a Democratic Presidential campaign.  How seriously is the Republican Congress taking the allegations and statements from our intelligence agencies that the Russians were involved in this last Presidential campaign?  It is time for us to have an independent, bipartisan commission beyond Congress to look into this and give us solid answers. We need to appoint people to head this commission of the stature of GEN Colin Powell and Sandra Day O'Connor, who served on the Supreme Court, who are credible people to lead this effort and this investigation and give America the truth.  A week or so ago the New York Times published the results of a recent poll that asked Americans what other nations they considered to be our closest allies and worst enemies. The results weren't surprising. Canada, the UK, and Australia topped the list of our best allies. Of America's enemies, the top nations were different, but they included North Korea, Iran, and That makes me wonder why President Trump, in the span of a week, managed to insult and hang up on the telephone call with the Prime Minister of Australia and then go on national news to once again defend Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, in light of what I just said earlier. Just a few days later, it is revealed that his National Security Advisor, General Flynn, the one who was fired by the previous administration and led chants unworthy of a great democracy about locking up a political opponent, was, in fact, speaking to a Russian official as a private citizen before President Trump took office.  Monday, we learned that former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, whom President Trump abruptly fired, had warned the White House that General Flynn had misled senior administration officials about his communications with the Russian Ambassador and warned he was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Understand what I have just said. The man who was picked by President Trump as his top National Security Advisor misled the President and the Vice President about a telephone conversation with the Russian Ambassador and, in the opinion of our top law enforcement officials, left himself vulnerable to Russian blackmail.  In the last days of the Obama administration, then Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan reportedly shared Yates' concerns and concurred with the recommendation to inform the Trump White Now that General Flynn has resigned, leaving an already chaotic National Security Council in even greater disarray, perhaps this isn't all that surprising anymore, but it certainly should be.  This President has a troubling habit of lashing out at everyone and anyone involved in a perceived slight--dangerous and unbecoming behavior when granted the privilege to become President of this great In fact, the number and range of those attacked or insulted by Twitter is so significant I wouldn't even start to list them, but it is important to note the list includes Republicans, Democrats, labor leaders, businesses, retired generals, and others in almost every conceivable category. Actually, one looks at the list and you quickly realize the only unifying factor is not about putting America first or America's image but instead about protecting a deeply fragile ego.  Listen to this excerpt from a vast list of those who have been attacked by President Trump: President George Bush, President George Bush, Speaker Paul Ryan, Florida Rick Scott, Federal judges, former Governor of New Hampshire John Sununu, the Republican establishment, NATO, Major League Baseball, Macy's Department Store, European leaders, Britain, Germany, New Jersey, the American delegate system, the ``Today'' show, ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``The View,'' Chief Justice John Roberts, Colin Powell, President of United Steelworkers Local 1999, ABC News, NBC News, FOX News, and seemingly every other media outlet.  Now that we are in the category of those who have been attacked, we can't leave Nordstrom off the list. The President even insulted the former Governor of South Carolina, then chose her to be U.In fact, there are hundreds upon hundreds on this list--a list that in a foreboding, Nixonian way keeps on growing.  So if you make any criticism or joke about President Trump, make any perceived slight, run a department store that doesn't carry his daughter's products, lead a labor union, or do just about anything, be prepared for an attack by a Trump tweet--except if you happen to be the former Communist KGB official who now leads the one nation that actually recently attacked our That would be Vladimir  How is it possible?  Russian President Putin launched a cyber attack of war on the United[[Page S1137]]He interfered in our election and tried to affect the outcome and pick the winner. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been available in increasing amounts over the last several months. Yet we have a President who not only denies the Russian attack but has a strange infatuation with President Putin--but is also suggesting policies that dangerously puppet those of  It is now revealed that Trump's National Security Advisor, LTG Michael Flynn, lied about discussing sanctions with the Russian Ambassador immediately after the Obama administration announced new sanctions for the attack on our election. Not only had General Flynn and the White House suddenly remembered the facts differently, but more dangerously, did Flynn's conversation undercut U.sanctions, especially after Russia's assault on our election? And who instructed General Flynn to have these suspiciously timed conversations with the Russian Ambassador?  It is deeply troubling to imagine what might have been insinuated in those talks, but given the blinders this President has shown in ignoring President Putin so far, I worry about a suggested or hinted trading for U.sanctions on Russia for little in return.  Quite simply, you don't make America great by selling out to a former Communist KGB official. You only negotiate with such a dictator from a position of strength, not denial or naivete.  So what has been the response to the cyber attack of war on America, Flynn's dalliance with the Russians, and the dangerous disarray at the Trump National Security Council from the party of Ronald Reagan, who knew the Communist mind pretty well? Near silence. The party of Ronald Reagan has spoken zero times about the Russian attack or Flynn's actions on the floor of the Senate since early I waited this morning for the Senate Republican leader to raise the obvious front-page story across America about the resignation of President Trump's National Security Advisor, and not a word was mentioned.  Compare this to the 36 times the Republicans have come to the floor to talk about stripping health care away from millions of Americans in the last several weeks. Even President Trump's new Attorney General, who brazenly changed his tune on Russia once having joined the Trump campaign, said he had not yet read intelligence reports on the Russian attack--a position even more stunning in light of the recent reports of Sally Yates' warnings. Yet, incredibly, his colleagues were ready to confirm him for the highest law enforcement position in the land.  I see the Democratic leader here, and I want to yield the floor to him, but I will close with this. Are we going to have a fulsome, honest, independent investigation of the Russian involvement in this election campaign? We know it happened. Seventeen of our intelligence agencies confirm it.  We also know that an investigation is underway by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about this campaign and the involvement of the Russians, and we know as well now that because of the conversations of our National Security Advisor with the Russian Ambassador, he was forced to resign in the first 4 weeks of this administration.  This calls out for a thorough investigation. The Republican Party in Congress, which spent hours and days and weeks and months in investigations involving Hillary Clinton, should at least acknowledge the gravity of this matter and bring this to a full investigation--an open and public one that can be trusted, an independent investigation--that stands up for our basic democracy and does not allow the invasion of the Russians or any other country into our democratic process.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1136.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 41, PROVIDING FOR",2017.0,14.0,January

We have tried, with no success, topass appropriations bills--12 of them--that would meet our obligation to fund the government for the entire fiscal year. We havehad two continuing resolutions, which are temporary spending bills. And here we are again discussing a budget resolution.  But it isn't really about the budget; it is about the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare, a law passed 6 years ago withthe goal of providing affordable health insurance for all I voted for that bill. It is one of the most importantbills I have ever voted for, and I believe that, despite shortcomings, it has achieved its goal and it has done it in a way thatmost American families would agree they want to see.  As an example, there are very few families in America who have every member of the family in perfect health. In the old daysbefore the Affordable Care Act, if you happened to have a child who had survived a cancer situation, a spouse with diabetes, andyou went to buy a health insurance plan, you ran into a problem: They might not want to insure your family because of that sickchild, or they might want to charge you a premium way beyond your reach. So in the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, we said: As ahealth insurance company, you cannot sell insurance in America and discriminate against a family or person because of apreexisting medical condition.  From where I am sitting, my own personal life experience and my family's experience, thank goodness. We had members of ourfamily with serious health issues. I worried about that all the time as a husband, as a father. The Affordable Care Act gave meand every other American the peace of mind that health insurance companies could not discriminate against us or our familiesbecause of a preexisting condition.  There was also a practice where they would put a limit on how much coverage you could buy in a health insurance policy. Somany people thought: I have a great health insurance policy. It has a $100,000 limit. I will never hit that number; I am ahealthy person.  The next accident, the next diagnosis, and that healthy person realized that $100,000 in today's world of health carecosts--you could eat that up in a minute and find yourself without any health insurance protection. What happens to you next?  You have been diagnosed with cancer. You start treatment. It is expensive, and now your health insurance policy has reacheda point where it doesn't cover you anymore. What then are your options? Stop treatment? Exhaust your savings? Throw yourself onthe mercy of a hospital and hope for the best?  We ended that. ObamaCare ended that. They can no longer put limits on health insurance policies because none of us--not oneof us--knows what kind of health crisis we might face or a member of our family might face tomorrow. That is important.  A third provision in ObamaCare, which most families would understand in a hurry, involved what to do with that recentcollege graduate. What are you going to do with that daughter whose graduation you are so proud to go to, and then it dawns onyou that she doesn't have a full-time job yet and that the part-time job she has doesn't have any health insurance benefits.  I remember calling my daughter and saying to her: Jennifer, I know you had health insurance as a student. What is yoursituation now?  Oh, Dad, I am fine. I am healthy. I am not worried.  I am worried, as a father, something is going to happen to her and she will have no health insurance protection.  Do you know what ObamaCare did? ObamaCare said I could keep my daughter under my family health insurance plan until shereached the age of 26. Peace of mind for 2, 3, 4 years while that son or daughter is starting their professional life, theirlife of employment. For thousands in Illinois and across the United States, more peace of mind that health insurance would bethere when your family really needed it.  We also said we don't think you ought to discriminate against people when you sell them health insurance just because, forexample, you happen to be a woman. Yes, the health insurance premiums charged women were higher than those for men. Obviously,women can have challenges in their lives but so can men. We said you cannot discriminate in health insurance premiums underObamaCare between men and women.  These are issues that affect the real world--what people pay for insurance, whether they qualify for insurance, and whetherinsurance will be there when you need it. That is what ObamaCare did. By providing helping hands to those in lower and middle-income categories, we extended the reach of health insurance under ObamaCare to cover 20 to 30 million more Wecurrently have the highest percentage of Americans with health insurance in modern history.  We had another provision too. We said: If you happen to be a senior citizen under Medicare and you are paying for yourprescription drugs, that can be expensive. Under the old law, before ObamaCare, there was a gap in coverage, and you might spend$1,000 or $2,000 out of your savings account each year just to keep taking your meds. We closed the gap so you had continuouscoverage under Medicare as a senior.  Important? You bet it is. A lot of seniors ended up retired with limited savings wanting their meds, their prescriptions, sothey can remain strong and independent as long as possible. Don't we want them to? So that, in a brief summary, will containfour or five of the main features of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act--more Americans with the guarantee of health insurancethan any time in our modern history in the United States of  How important is it to have health insurance? If you have ever been the father of a very sick child and you didn't havehealth insurance, it is a life experience you will never forget. I know. I lived through it. At that time, I thought, if I don'tdo anything else the rest of my life, I am always going to have health insurance, and I did. At some sacrifice to my wife andme, but we made sure we had it because for a period of time when we had no health insurance, I felt like I had let my familydown and I let my daughter down. I didn't want it to happen again.  I don't want anybody else to go through that. We want to make sure health insurance is there for all of us. Some people say:If you are rich, you ought to get it, but if you are not, tough luck.  I don't think so. I think health care and health insurance protection should be a basic right in this great Nation ofThat was the driving force behind passing ObamaCare, passing the Affordable Care  The Republicans hate the Affordable Care Act like the devil hates holy water. They despise it. Over 60 times they voted torepeal it in the House of It drives them into a rage. The first thing they say is, we can't wait to get a newPresident and abolish  The obvious responsible question to them is, And what happens the day after you abolish it? What happens when it comes topreexisting conditions? Can health insurance companies now discriminate against people again? What happens when it comes to thelimits on how much a health insurance policy would pay? Are we going to be back in the day when there isn't enough coverage whenyou and your family desperately need it?  What happens to those kids fresh out of college if they can't get on your family health insurance plan? Do you want to goout and buy an individual policy for that son or daughter who is still looking for a job? How about the seniors? Are they goingto go back to the time where they have to pay out of pocket for their prescription drugs? I think those are all legitimatequestions.  Do you know what the answer is on the Republican side? Trust us. We are just going to abolish this program, and someday, nottoday and not soon, but someday we will come up with another[[Page S42]]idea. That is irresponsible. They are replacing affordablecare with chaos. They are saying to the American people: Just trust us. Someday we will dream up a plan.  You know what, they have had 6 years to come up with a plan, 6 years to come up with an alternative to the Affordable They have been unable to do it. It is difficult. It is painful.  You know what is ironic, the Affordable Care Act is based on a Republican model of health insurance. This was what theRepublicans suggested years ago: Use private insurance companies and make it available to all That is what we did. Alot of Democrats felt there was a better way: Why don't we make a Medicare Program for every American a nonprofit program thatis there. We couldn't get it done. We didn't have the votes, and the Republicans wouldn't help us.  In the first step of the new year and the new Congress, the new Republican majority in the Senate wants to abolish theAffordable Care Act, wants to put millions of American families at the mercy of health insurance companies. They must think weare suffering from amnesia and that we had forgotten what that was all about--sitting on the phone for hour after weary hour withsome adjuster who may or may not be in the United States, trying to argue about whether your son or daughter can go into ahospital, whether your wife can receive the medical treatment the doctor asked about.  That is what it used to be, and that is what it is going to go back to when we abolish the Affordable Care Act and don'treplace it with something that is as good or better. That is the first step in the Republican program, make 20 to 30 millionAmericans more vulnerable when it comes to their health care. That is not the end of it.  I live in a State that has the great city of Chicago, Cook County regional area, but downstate we are very rural, smalltownI know from my congressional experience and from my life as a Senator representing that State, there are downstatehospitals that cannot survive without the Affordable Care In my State, some of those hospitals are the major employers intheir communities and the only go-to place for someone seriously ill or injured.  The Republicans have yet to suggest any suggestion at all about how we are going to keep those hospitals open. They arestarting to contact me now--the hospitals as well as the clinics and the health care providers, and they are asking: TheRepublicans really aren't going to do this, are they? They are not just going to abolish it and leave us with this chaos tofollow.  Sad to say, that is exactly what they are going to do. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote an article today and said hethought it was wrong on the Republican side to do that. He said: The responsible thing to do is to have an alternative beforeyou abolish the Affordable Care Good for him. That is common sense. You would expect it from a party that says it isconservative in its approach to government. What they are suggesting with the Affordable Care Act is not conservative. It isdestructive. It is catastrophic. It is irresponsible.  I hope my colleagues will join me. We need two or three Republicans to join us to stop this effort. Let us sit downtogether, Democrats and Republicans, take the Affordable Care Act and make it more effective, fix the problems that are part ofit--and there are some--make sure we keep our promise to the American people that they will have access to affordable, qualityhealth care. Keep these providers covered by the Affordable Care Act in business in rural areas and inner cities and all acrossour That is our responsibility.                                  DACA  Mr.President, 16 days from now, and just a few steps from where the Senate Chamber is located, we will have an inaugurationfor the 45th President of the United States, Donald On that day, the fate of more than 750,000 young people in Americawill be hanging in the balance. They will be waiting to learn whether they have a place in our Nation's future or whether theywill be asked to leave.  It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama, joined by Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of On abipartisan basis, we asked the President to stop the deportation of young immigrants who grew up in this country. We called themDREAMers, after a bill I introduced 15 years ago. Who are they? Babies, infants, toddlers, children, young adults under the ageof 16 brought to America by their parents from another country, and the proper papers were not filed. You can't hold the kidsresponsible. They didn't decide to come here. You certainly can't hold them responsible for not filing the papers. They werejust children at the time.  If anybody should be held responsible, it is the parents. What do we do about the kids who have lived their entire lives inthe United States believing this was their country, this was their future, and now come to realize in their teenage years theyare undocumented and their future is uncertain?  We asked President Obama: Will you give these young people a temporary opportunity to stay, study, and work in America, andhe agreed to do it. It was called It was the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals What it said was, if you arein that category of a child brought to America and you are undocumented, step forward, pay a filing fee of almost $500 so thegovernment can process your application, submit yourself to a criminal background check, including fingerprints, and let us lookinto your background and see if there is anything you have done that would disqualify you from staying in the United Ifyou are approved, for 2 years--renewable--you will not be deported and you can work in  Many young people in that circumstance were reluctant to step forward. Their parents had warned them their entire lives thatif they turned themselves into the government, they might be deported--in fact, their family might be deported with them. Theysaid: The President has offered us this opportunity for a chance. We are going to follow this, do the right thing, make anapplication. Almost 800,000 of them qualified. They are DACA recipients. Others will be eligible in the months ahead. DACA hasbeen a success.  What will President Donald Trump do with these DACA students? He made some pretty harsh statements during the course of thecampaign about immigration. I think he is reflecting on these kids as a special category. This is what President-Elect DonaldTrump said to TIME magazine just a few weeks ago about the DREAMers, the DACA recipients.       We'regoing to work something out that's going to make      people happy and proud. They got brought here at a very young      age, they'veworked here, they've gone to school here. Some      were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in      never-never landbecause they don't know what's going to      happen.  I appreciate Mr.Trump's comments, soon-to-be President I hope he will keep the DACA Program in place, but I amworking with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to give him an option. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of SouthCarolina, and I have joined the lead sponsors on what we call the BRIDGE The BRIDGE Act is an opportunity to protect theseyoung people legally, on a temporary basis, while Congress rolls up its sleeves and takes up immigration.  I am happy to have Senator Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake, Republicans from Alaska and Arizona as cosponsors, aswell as Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York, and I hope others will follow. I believe DACAwas a lawful exercise of the President's authority. Some disagree with that completely. Regardless of whether you agree ordisagree, I hope you will agree that these young people should be allowed to have a bridge so they aren't deported, they don'tlose their right to work or go to school.  Incidentally, when these young DACA DREAMers go to school, they have to pay for it right out of their pockets. They don'tqualify for any Federal assistance. It is a special effort and a special sacrifice. I have come to the floor over 100 times overthe last 10 or so years to tell the stories of these young people. I think the stories tell a lot morethan any speech I could give.  This young man is Luis Forgive me for being especially drawn to this photo because Luis is standing in front of mycollege, Georgetown[[Page S43]]University, wearing one of the Georgetown Hoyas shirts.  Let me tell you about He was 8 years old when his family came to the United States from He had a difficultchildhood in Santa Ana, His parents separated. He lived with his mom in a car garage for several years. After hismom remarried, he lived with his stepfather, who turned out to be abusive.  Luis overcame these circumstances and still was a good student. He graduated high school in the top 1 percent of his classwith a 4.69 GPA, and he passed all nine advanced placement exams that he took. He was involved in extracurricular and volunteeractivities. He was the secretary of the school's National Honor Society, and he helped organize an anti-bullying campaign in hislocal elementary school. He was a mentor to incoming freshmen in high school. Saturdays, instead of taking it easy, hevolunteered to tutor other kids in math, and he volunteered to help a teacher at a local school. He was active in his churchevery Sunday, translated the pastor's sermon into English for those who didn't speak Spanish, and cleaned up the church beforeand after the Sunday services.  Because of his outstanding record in high school, Luis was admitted to Georgetown He is currently a sophomoremajoring in American studies and minoring in government. He continues to use his spare time to help others. He is a member ofthe provost committee for diversity and co-chair of Hoya Saxa Weekend, a program that brings students from underrepresentedcommunities to Luis is a leader of Strive for College, a program that mentors students in the inner city highschools. His dream is to be a high school teacher, which isn't surprising given the strong commitment he has already shown.  He wrote me a letter and here's what he said:       DACA gave me the confidence and security I've nothad      before. I lived in fear and the shadows. Thanks to DACA,      however, I've been able to do things I otherwise wouldn't be      ableto do like travel through an airport or working on      campus. I've always felt that I am an American, but having      DACA allowed me tostop living in constant fear and      uncertainty. Now these fears have come back again.  If DACA is eliminated, Luis could be forced back into the shadows. The day after DACA, Luis will not be able to travel orwork on a campus. He will lose his legal status, and he could be deported back to Mexico, a country that he hasn't lived insince he was 8 years old.  Luis and other DREAMers have a lot to give Would we be stronger if we deport him, take this man's talent, drive,and energy and banish him from this country? I don't think so.  I hope President-Elect Trump will understand this and will continue the DACA program. If he decides to end DACA, then I hopethis administration will work with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act into law for Luis and for thousands of others who will becounting on it.

7702,topic-id,2087,"Mr.President, today we have a new Soon we will have a new For the first time in years,hardworking Americans will have their voices heard as we take the first steps to repair the Nation's broken health caresystem--steps to remove Washington from the equation and to put control back where it belongs--with the patients, their families,and their doctors.  The President's health law has pushed insurance markets to the brink of collapse. Premiums for hardworking families aresoaring, while patients' choices are dwindling. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to face the facts thatObamaCare has failed to deliver on its core promises and is hurting far more than it is helping.  I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle share our goal of a robust health care system for hardworking families,and I truly hope they will work with us to find common ground that delivers more choices and lowers costs. I welcome the inputfrom all the Nation's lawmakers as we endeavor to listen to the American people in this pursuit. But first, it is important toremember how we got here so that the actions that we will be taking this year are considered in proper context.  After the 2008 election, Democrats controlled the Presidency and had a majority in the House and a supermajority in theThis allowed Senate Democrats in 2009 to pass a health care plan without any Republican support, which is exactly whatthey did. House Democrats had initially approved a health care reform bill with several important differences. So congressionalDemocrats needed to address these concerns in a conference committee. But plans to iron out the differences between the Houseand Senate versions were derailed in early 2010, when Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority with the Massachusettsspecial election that resulted in placing Senator Scott Brown in the seat formerly held by the late Senator Ted He hadheld that seat since 1962.  With the filibuster-proof majority lost, Democrats in the House approved the Senate-passed health care bill without anyRepublican votes and sent it to the President, while vowing to use the budget reconciliation process to address theircolleagues' concerns with the Senate legislation.  Subsequent budget reconciliation legislation was passed by Democrats and signed into law by President Combined withthe initial health care bill, ObamaCare was created.  Now, I share this brief history of ObamaCare only as a reminder that, while my colleagues will surely complain about usingthe reconciliation process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable law, they should rememberthey actually employed the exact same procedure to secure the passage of  Recent headlines show the ObamaCare problem is only getting worse and discourages people from seeking so-called coverage.Last October, at Bloomberg's The Year Ahead Summit in New York, the CEO of Aetna discussed the issues surrounding their decisionnot to participate in ObamaCare exchanges, saying:       As the rates rise, the healthier people pull outbecause the      out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. . . . Young people can      do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays andSaturdays,      health insurance.  Now, if you are young and healthy, ObamaCare has made it an easy choice to opt out of health coverage. But if you are not sofortunate--for those who must have coverage--it quickly becomes a frightening reality. I have constituents in Wyoming who havewritten to me, with worry and concern about their surging health insurance premiums. I recently heard from a young woman who isexperiencing the worst of this law. She said:       Dear Senator Enzi,       I am writing with concernsspecifically in the way that our      country is heading in respect to healthcare services.       I am a 25 year old with no medicalconditions, I rarely need      a doctor visit, however as I looked into the health insurance      for me and my 8 month old son, alsowithout health problems, I      have found insurance to be incredibly expensive. Based on the      cost of our health care last year,which included a C-section      and the birth of our son, our family would spend less on      health care if we paid for medical expensesout of pocket and      did not have health insurance. However, in order to obey the      law this is not an option.       I have researchedand calculated the most cost effective      health care option for our family. We are looking at paying      almost $800 a month for ourinsurance, even with my husband      receiving insurance through work. This is almost 1/3 of our      family's monthly income. . . .Insurance is becoming a huge      burden for our family.  Now, that is the reality for many of our constituents across the country. She is trying to do the right thing for herfamily's health, but the law is crippling them financially. Our answer must beto not ignore these problems. For many Americans caught up in ObamaCare's tangled and expensive web of regulations, thesituation is grim and only getting worse by the day. It is time to act.  One of the most disturbing parts of this law is that Americans are now paying more in taxes to pay for the very health lawthat is driving up their insurance premiums. The law will saddle American households with $1 trillion--$1 trillion--in new taxesand penalties over the next 10 years, unless Congress acts. ObamaCare's crushing regulations mean smaller paychecks forfamilies, while holding back small businesses from expanding and hiring new workers. For every American, ObamaCare has meantmore government, more bureaucracy, and more rules and regulations, along with soaring health care costs--along with soaringhealth care costs.  It is time to lift the burdens and higher costs this law has placed on all The Senate is poised to pass a repealresolution that will set the stage for true legislative relief from ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuringa stable transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage.  Let me repeat that. The Senate is poised to pass a repeal resolution that will set the stage for true legislative relieffrom ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable transition in which those with insurance will not loseaccess to health care coverage. This will allow us to move step-by-step on a new set of reforms, listening carefully to theadvice of the millions of Americans affected and to do our best to make sure that we proceed wisely and do no harm.  Fortunately, America now has a President committed to repealing ObamaCare and moving toward a system that offers morechoices, lower costs, and more individual control for millions of hardworking  The American people have endured a lot under ObamaCare and its broken promises. As a Presidential candidate not so long ago,then-Senator Barack Obama, a Democrat from Illinois serving here, promised Americans they could keep their health plan if theyliked it. Millions soon learned they couldn't, and others soon wouldn't. This is because ObamaCare has drastically reducedAmericans' choice of health care plans through a Federal takeover of the insurance marketplace. In fact, the President's promisethat ``if you like your plan, you can keep it'' has proven to be one of many unfulfilled and unattainable promises of  In Wyoming, we have seen the real impact of ObamaCare on our health insurance market. Wyoming now only has one healthinsurer in the individual market, both on and off the ObamaCare exchange. Many States are experiencing a similar issue of havinginsurers leaving the exchanges entirely. So for Wyomingites, the Obama administration's talking points about ``choice'' were inthe end just more empty promises.[[Page S33]]  Americans were also promised lower health care costs, but even the administration admits that ObamaCare is failing toaddress costs, with average premiums rising by 25 percent for silver-level plans on the Federal exchange. That is in 1 year.This means that families have to decide whether to purchase unaffordable insurance or to pay a fine. In most cases, they areliterally paying more money for less control over their health care.  Health care costs in Wyoming continue to be among the highest in the Nation, with other States not far behind. ObamaCare'smandates and taxes on employer-sponsored health plans are not only leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses but also to fewerchoices and fewer services for the 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health benefits. Let me repeat that: Themandates and taxes on employer-sponsored health plans are not only leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses but to fewer choicesand services for the 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health benefits.  According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, individual employees who have job-based insurance have seen theirout-of-pocket expenses climb by hundreds of dollars year after year. Employees workingfor small businesses now have deductibles of over $1,800 on average. Since ObamaCare became law, several large employers havestopped offering benefits to part-time employees altogether.  Over the past 50 years, our Nation has made great strides in improving the quality of life for all Americans, but thesetransformative changes are always forged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation. These qualities are essentialto the success and longevity of crucial programs such as Medicare and  This is a crucial time for health care in We do not have the luxury of ignoring the growing problems in the healthinsurance markets and the crushing premiums faced by families across our country. That is why we are doing this first. Thefailures of ObamaCare have metastasized since its passage.  We must act now to repeal ObamaCare and provide relief to the millions of Americans who have been harmed by this law. Reliefwill require a stable transition period, which ensures those with coverage today continue to have access to health caretomorrow. Unwinding this tangle of partisan gridlock to make meaningful changes will not be easy. Our goal is to create a healthcare system where Washington makes fewer decisions and families are empowered to control their own health care with more choicesand lower costs.  This is where we find ourselves today. Congress and soon the new President will be in a position to begin the process ofrepealing Passing this resolution is just the first step on a path to repair health care for millions of hard-workingAmericans whose experiences with ObamaCare have meant broken promises, higher costs, and fewer choices.  This is the budget resolution we are debating now. As far as the budget part of it, all this is, is a statement of where weare at the moment. This budget went into effect last It has been changed a few times in the meantime, and this is areflection of the changes that have been made up to this point.  The difference is in title II, which is where the reconciliation can take place. You will notice that it is a very simpletitle. There is not much to it. It requires that the Committee on Finance of the Senate shall report changes in laws within itsjurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not less than $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2026. The Committeeon Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will report changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not lessthan $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2026. There is no specificity in this as to how the reconciliationwill take place. That is up to the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on the Senate sideand the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Committee on Ways and Means on the House side to come up with the reconciliationbill, which has to pass a lot of Senate rules in order to be done, but you will notice that there isn't any specificity in hereon how to do that.  That comes later. That will be another budget debate we will have, but it sets the stage so that can be done. Hopefully, itwill be done quickly and we will be able to find solutions for the hard-working Americans whose experiences with ObamaCare arebroken promises, higher costs, fewer choices. I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us in this effort so that we can comeup with solutions so that Americans can afford the insurance they want and need.  I remember when we started this debate, I think there were 30 million people uninsured. Today, I think there are 30 millionpeople uninsured. It is a different 30 million, though: The 30 million who couldn't get insurance now have insurance, and 30million people who had insurance now can't afford their insurance. It is time for us to take care of both 30 millions and notjust one.

7577,topic-id,541,"Mr.Speaker, I too want to join and thank Representative Veasey and Representative Plaskett for this opportunity.  Tonight, I stand with my colleagues urging support of policy solutions that will ensure our communities have unfettered access to the ballot box and to call for solutions to Republican-led attempts to suppress minority voting rights across the country.  Additionally, I must state my view of the recent action taken by President Trump which I assert has reduced the national trust in our democracy.  In the short time since President Trump has taken office, he has set forth a national security plan that would require broad spending increases. He has set forth an executive order to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in place. He has seemingly put us directly at odds with Mexico, our bordering country, due to a wall that he has set forth as one of his key proposals, and then expected and even demanded that they actually pay for it.  He has ignored the facts and has declared that 3 to 5 million people allegedly voted fraudulently in the election.  And last, but certainly not least, he has set forth an executive order banning travel from Muslim countries and suspended the refugee program, an action that makes our Nation less safe.  Over the weekend, I joined with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, Representative Robert Brady, and Representative Brendan Boyle and spoke directly with those who were immediately impacted by this executive action.  We joined with the protesters in voicing extreme discontent over the executive order and vowed to do our part to remedy what we can only refer to as a ``forced error'' of global proportions. We must work collectively to tear down the ban and to be the open democracy that our Constitution allows us to be.[[Page H727]]  Just today, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told attorneys in the Justice Department not to make legal arguments defending President Trump's order on immigration and refugees.  The actions taken by President Trump are not in the best interest of our Nation, our national security, nor are they in the best interest of our communities; that is why we must continue to move forward policy proposals that have been introduced by my colleagues to ensure equal access to the ballot box to ensure we protect the voting rights of those in our communities so that they know that their voices are being heard.  For instance, my House colleague, Representative Sewell, introduced the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would set forth a geographical coverage formula that is based on the current conditions that include 13  The bill will establish a rolling nationwide trigger that continuously moves so that only States that have a recent record of racial discrimination in voting would be covered. The Voting Rights Advancement Act would set forth greater transparency in Federal elections to ensure that voters are made aware of the late-breaking changes in voter procedures and would deter discrimination from occurring and protect voters from discrimination.  Let us continue to ensure the voices of our communities are heard. My colleagues and I stand united and ready to combat these actions that run counter to the best interest of those we are elected to represent.

The Department of Homeland Security spends billions of taxpayer dollars annually on a variety of systems to secure our borders, protect our aviation system, safeguard our shores, and shield our cyberspace, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have found longstanding problems with how DHS has managed these programs. DHS continues to be on GAO's high-risk list for acquisition management, meaning these programs are susceptible to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.  In addition, the Department has failed to have a strategic vision for its major purposes. The result has been wasted effort and taxpayer money gone, with little to show for it. Look at the TSA puffer machines from a few years ago as a past example.  Without a comprehensive strategy, industry also does not have the needed information to best support DHS in making smart investments in executing its mission.

7469,topic-id,1388,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation that will, in the final analysis, make it more difficult for hardworking Americans to stand up to corporate malfeasance; a piece of legislation that jettisons a history of legal precedent in the blink of an eye because, well, it helps keep the deep pockets of the ultrawealthy as deep as possible.  I learned this law in law school in 1959, but it was in existence way before that time, and now my friends across the aisle are going to tell us that this legislation is needed because it will protect small businesses. This is a feint, folks. Small businesses--indeed all of us--have been and continue to be protected by the century-old jurisprudential rule that the Republicans come here today to upend. In reality, all this bill will do is make it more difficult for regular folks across this country to bring lawsuits against massive corporations.  I shudder to think what would have happened in the critically important asbestos case had this particular law been in effect; and there are many more.  This bill will make it more expensive both in time and treasure for our fellow Americans to hold corporations responsible in the courtroom, a need all the more prevalent today as my friends across the aisle have been busy gutting regulations at a dizzying pace.  Let me make it clear, after we finish, my colleague from Colorado and I are going to go back to the Rules Committee to discuss some more judicial reform. A lot of it is stuff that is going to harm little people in the courts and to cause them not to have access to the court system, as have many of the regulations that we have already disapproved.  Let us be clear, the American people didn't vote for dirty water, but that is what they got with this Republican majority when it voted to repeal a rule that barred corporations from dumping mining debris into our drinking water, helping powerful mining companies by hurting all of the rest of the people in their near curtilage.  The American people didn't vote to weaken the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that is what this majority did when it passed a bill adding more hurdles to the SEC rulemaking process, making it more difficult for the agency to protect consumers, helping Wall Street while putting our economy at risk. I will make a prediction[[Page H1613]]here. It may not happen right away, but just like we saw the Great Depression that we are just coming out of, we are likely to see that same kind of situation again by virtue of lessening the rules against violations in securities.  The American people didn't vote to drug test Americans on unemployment insurance--degrading the hardworking men and women in this country--but that is what this Republican majority did without delay.  Mr.Speaker, the list really does go on and on. In fact, just yesterday, Republicans continued to chant the corporate clarion call with the unveiling of what I now will call their shameful replacement of the Affordable Care Until there is a resolution, I am going to call it  My colleagues like to tout how short the bill is compared to the Affordable Care Well, the American people will be surprised to find that, in that brevity, Republicans managed to repeal an Affordable Care Act provision that placed a limit on insurance executives' compensation. Let me repeat that. They managed to repeal a provision that placed a limit on insurance executives' compensation. The insurance executives shouldn't be too surprised by this, however. Repeatedly, Republicans have shown they represent corporate interests over the interests of the American people.  But my Republican colleagues didn't stop there. Their so-called replacement, the Trump bill, also claims to have done away with the individual mandate. What they don't tell you is that, instead, their plan calls for funneling money to the insurance companies in the form of a 30 percent surcharge if an individual goes without health insurance.  Let me tell all the older Americans and 80-year-old people like me to get ready because they are going to be able to charge you just exactly what they want to charge you, and all--mine and yours--insurance is going to go up if this particular measure were to become law.  That is right. Under the Republican healthcare proposal, if you, the American worker, goes without healthcare coverage for longer than 2 months--say you couldn't after a new plan between jobs--then Republicans give insurance companies the right to charge you 30 percent higher premiums. That is ridiculous.  Republicans didn't get rid of the individual mandate. They just turned the mandate into a windfall for insurance companies--a windfall that is going to work out great for insurance executives now that Republicans also removed the cap on their compensation tax deductions.  Mr.Speaker, let us not lose sight of the fact that it took Republicans 7 years of undermining the Affordable Care Act to finally come up with this proposal for replacing it.                              {time}  1345  Their plan would kick millions of Americans off their health insurance and force millions more to pay higher premiums. It would take health care away from the poor, give tax cuts to the rich, and pull the rug out from under seniors, families, and children.  In fact, this plan is so bad that Republicans literally hid not only their horrific proposal, but themselves, from their constituents. Many of their Members are seeing it just in the last 36 hours. They did this by callously brushing off townhall meeting after townhall meeting.  Why all the smoke and mirrors regarding something as simple as this measure is in light of the fact that they ran on replacing it? Why hide it and why rush it and why go through this charade that most of us know and several Senators said yesterday will be dead on arrival?  Actually, let me ask the American people. Who do you think the Republican Party is representing, you or corporate America?  Mr.Speaker, we are not even a full 2 months into the Republican-led government and, in addition to the unconstitutional Muslim bans--and notice I said ``bans,'' because the old one is nothing but the new one, and the new one is the old one, minus one, and that is the country of Iraq--we have the Republican denial of clear Russian influence in our most recent election.  Let me be very clear about this particular aspect. All of the intelligence agencies have indicated that there was Russian interference in this last election. I don't understand why we are not totally outraged and why there is not extraordinary emphasis on this kind of action against our fundamental democracy.  It is ridiculous that we are around here doing things that we know are not likely to pass the United States Senate and that we are disapproving regulations, yet we cannot get an independent commission to make a determination of how this impact occurred. And we do know that it occurred. I am outraged, and I would hope more Americans would be as well.  We have also seen the almost immediate recusal of the Attorney General due to his inability to be forthright with our Senate colleagues; wild and baseless claims emanating from late-night Twitter storms from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or Mar-a-Lago; and we have a Republican Party dedicated to ensuring that their corporate benefactors can rest easy, no matter the harm they cause to everyday working  Are we addressing any of these concerns here today?  I would imagine my colleague, rightly, will come back and argue that all the things that I just talked about are not this particular rule. Well, this rule is not even deserving of that kind of consideration, largely for the reason it is yet another structured rule disallowing Members of this House to have an opportunity to have input into a measure that is getting rid of a century of precedent in our judiciary. No, what we are doing is debating obscure civil procedure rules that date back to the days of President Teddy  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

7472,topic-id,339,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have great respect for the chairman of the Rules Committee and he knows that.  I just heard him say his insurance went up under Mine did, too. I also want to remind him that, if this measure as offered yesterday were to become law, his and my insurance is going to go up again.  So we weren't doing all of the things that you said you were going to do by bringing the price down. In addition, we don't even know what CBO's score is with respect to this matter.  You said that you are reading it to understand it now, yet Members are in the Energy and Commerce Committee, as you explained, marking it up, and they don't even know what CBO's score is. I will get back to that in a few minutes about all these people we pay over there to do that work, and then we are not utilizing them.  I also want to address my friend from Colorado and have him understand that I am not precluded from presenting to the American public what legislation we wish to prioritize.  As the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this I won't reiterate it, in the interest of time.  I will have a previous question that will demonstrably show what legislation we think we should be addressing. I will do that for as long as I am given the opportunity to manage rules. I will come down here and present the position of the Democratic Party so that they understand our priorities and not necessarily am I hidebound by this rule.

7479,topic-id,274,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule which would modify the rules of the House to require a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before any legislation that would amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act may be considered in committee or on the House floor.  The Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at the Congressional Budget Office on what the cost and overall impact will be.  Mr.Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget We pay them collectively--and administrative duties--nearly $50 million a year to advise us at times exactly like this.  House rules already require the Congressional Budget Office cost estimates to be included in committee reports. We are simply trying to improve and strengthen this principle of transparency in order to ensure that we know the cost of this repeal legislation before we vote, and that includes the members in the Committee on Energy and Commerce today who are marking this up so as how they would know the cost before they vote in committee today.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1611.txt,511,1330,2017.0,8.0,January
7480,topic-id,181,"Mr.Speaker, it is not too late for my friends across the aisle to tether themselves to the ideals that have made this country great for generations; ideals that, if we are to be saved from the rushing current we presently find ourselves being dragged down by, will be, as they always have been, those ideals which save us from ourselves.  We are a nation built upon the strength of immigrants, of teachers, of doctors, of mill workers, garbagemen and -women, small-business owners, and farmers. We are a nation of dreamers and innovators, respectful of our individuality and mindful of our unparalleled power once unified in common cause.  At some point, my Republican friends will, I hope, realize that their unabashed and wholesale championing[[Page H1616]]of corporate interests at the expense of hardworking Americans is a losing cause. For the sake of our environment, our children, our grandchildren, and our unborn children, I hope this day is earlier rather than later.

7690,topic-id,458,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing the 400 Years of African American History Commission  We are 2 years away from a key anniversary in American history. August 2019 will mark 400 years since the first documented arrival of Africans who came to English America by way of Point Comfort, This historic and tragic moment, when ``20 and odd'' Africans, as it was recorded were the first recorded group of Africans to arrive involuntarily and were sold as involuntary laborers or indentured servants in the colonies. This indelible mark in American history should not pass without recognition.  During my tenure as Governor of Virginia, I presided over the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA, by the English colonists in 1604. Two years ago I attended the 450th anniversary of the founding of Augustine, FL, which celebrated Hispanic heritage. Both commemorations included activities sponsored by Federal commissions, which were voted on and passed by  Having commemorated the English and Spanish heritage of our founding, there is no reason it should be any different for the arrival and continuous presence of Africans and African Americans in the English settlements in 1619. There is no dispute that the beginning of African and African-American presence in what is now the United States was both heartbreaking and regrettable. Although in 1619 slavery was not yet an institution, the involuntary status of those first Africans was the impetus to slavery. Slavery as an institution broke up families, resulted in the deaths of thousands, and caused irreparable damage to our American psyche. And though we should never forget that period of stain on our history, slavery is not the only part of African-American history. I have had an opportunity to visit the National Museum of African American History and The museum makes a tremendous effort to tell the complete story of African Americans and it is important that we remember the whole story. African Americans have contributed to the economic, academic, social, cultural and moral well-being of this Their impact and influence has shaped this nation to what it is today.  So today, with my cosponsor Senator Mark Warner, I reintroduce the 400 Years of African American History Commission Act, which would establish a commission that would plan programs and activities across the country to recognize the arrival and influence of African Americans since 1619. It is my hope the establishment of a ``400th'' commission would create an opportunity to bring continued national education about the significance the arrival of African Americans has made to the United States and the contributions that have been made since 1619. Additionally, the commission would create space to discuss race relations in America and focus on dismantling the institutional systems that have adversely hindered African American progress.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1219.txt,2176,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

7692,topic-id,267,"Mr.President, the National Capital Region relies on DC Hundreds of thousands of commuters take it every day, including the Federal workforce. Visitors use it when they come to our Nation's Capital on vacations, school trips, or events of national significance. Yet for too long, critical safety maintenance has been neglected, at the cost of countless lost hours and frustration for riders, and tragically, several fatalities.  That is why I and my colleagues from Virginia and Maryland--Senators Mark Warner, Ben Cardin, and Chris Van Hollen--and our bipartisan House colleagues are today introducing this compact creating the new Metro Safety This measure is introduced in concert with the Virginia and Maryland General Assemblies and the Council of the District of Columbia, to build momentum to encourage all three jurisdictions to enact this compact as quickly as possible, to get Metro back to safe reliable operation.  After fatal incidents on Metrorail in 2009 and 2015, the Federal Transit Administration took the unprecedented step of assuming direct safety oversight over the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority WMATA, stating that it would not return control until it certified that a robust safety oversight body was in place. The safety commission envisioned by this compact is that body.  There are many WMATA matters on which different stakeholders have different opinions, but everyone agrees that safety must be our top priority. Upon enactment of this compact by the three jurisdictions, I urge my colleagues to take swift action to approve this measure so that daily commuters and visitors to Washington, DC, can regain confidence that Metro will take them safely to their destinations.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1219.txt,2176,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

7493,topic-id,1461,"Mr.President, on January 15, 2017, an incredible ice storm came through my For some States that haven't seen ice storms, they are beautiful, but boy are they destructive. As freezing rain comes down, it lands on power lines, lands on trees, destroys the trees, power lines come down, and it is incredibly difficult for families and for regions when this happens. You can't move. You can't function. You can't travel the streets because they are covered with ice. It is very destructive.  The northwest part of our State experienced an ice storm like that on January 15. That ice storm devastated the Woodward area and all over the northwest--trees, debris, damage, power out for weeks in that area.  Then, in early March, it was starting to warm up. The forecasters from the National Weather Service and the Forest Service saw the forecast coming out of rapidly dropping humidity levels and very high winds, with a lot of debris damage still in the area. It was the perfect storm for wildfires.  They prepositioned assets in that area to be able to respond if they broke out, but on March 6--just a week and a half ago--wildfires broke out all across northwestern Four large fires in particular broke out simultaneously in multiple areas. Some of them were started by some of those same power lines that were weakened by the ice storm. Now the high winds--60 miles an hour--are taking down those weak power lines, and they are striking the ground and starting a fire spontaneously out in a field.  There were four individual fires across this area covering 315,000 acres just in One of those fires spread straight across the Kansas border and burned an additional 472,000 acres. To give you a point of reference of how large these fires were, the total fire damage that was done in acres is greater than the entire State of Rhode Twenty homes were destroyed, 3,000 cattle were killed in the field, 6,500 hogs were killed, and 7 people died in the fire.  Let me give you a picture of what we faced in this area as I went out last Friday with Senator Inhofe to tour the area both from the air and on the ground and to talk to farmers and those individuals who are trying to work through this very difficult process. Those farmers and ranchers are facing something you can't even imagine in their fields. For miles, there is no grass. The cattle that did survive the fire had literally no food on their ranch for miles. Hundreds of miles of fence line were taken down. Each mile of fence in Oklahoma, just a simple barbed wire fence, costs about $10,000, and hundreds of miles of fence line were destroyed.  We have animals that burned alive as they tried to escape the fire. We had deer that, as they were running across the fields, got caught up in the barbed wire fence and 16-mile-per-hour winds, and the 16-mile-an-hour flame caught up with the deer in the fence and burned them alive as they tried to escape.[[Page S1836]]  We have families who have lost absolutely everything.  We have volunteer firefighters across much of this area who would literally be fighting the fire in one county in one area and hear on the radio about how a fire had broken out in another county on a road right near their own home, and literally volunteer firefighters fighting one fire could hear on the radio about the destruction of their home at a different fire.  In different places, the volunteer firefighters and those who were gathered, both career and volunteers, would see a raging fire at the home of their neighbor, of people they knew. In western Oklahoma, you know your neighbors in that area. You know the folks in the county. They would head out to a home as the fire was rushing at them and try to fight it off, try to cut a fire line to be able to stop it. Eventually, the fire would get so close, they would literally take their fire equipment and park the equipment between the fire and the home and spray down their equipment in hopes that the fire would jump over the house as the firefighters just huddled behind their own equipment hoping the fire didn't come to them. They saved several homes by using that extreme method.  Neighbors took their own farm equipment and their own tractors and created fire lines to be able to protect their neighbors' homes.  These small community firefighters fought fires for hours and hours. They saved a lot of lives, and they saved a lot of structures.  I can't even begin to tell you the pain of walking through that area, what has been described by many as walking across a moonscape of destruction where there is literally nothing left.  What have we seen in that? I will state that what we have seen is a tenacious spirit from people who survived an ice storm, were without power for weeks in many areas, and then had a wildfire come right behind it and destroy what was left. Over 20,000 bales of hay have already been donated from farmers all over Oklahoma who are trying to feed the cattle that are still left--20,000 bales. Understand the expense of 20,000 bales of hay being donated but also understand the efforts of all the truckdrivers who loaded up their vehicles and personally paid the gas money and the travel expenses to be able to deliver that hay over hundreds of miles to those folks. Oftentimes, the travel of that truckdriver and the gas required are more expensive than the hay that is in the back of it, and they are delivering as much as they possibly can.  I have to thank the folks from the Farm Bureau; the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association; Western Equipment; Oklahoma Farm Credit; the Red Cross of Oklahoma; the Salvation Army; the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture; the Oklahoma Forestry Service; Southern Baptist Disaster Relief; Oklahoma emergency management--first responders from all over the State, volunteer and career firefighters who worked very long and difficult hours. USDA and FEMA were also on site. I thank Harper County Extension; all the emergency management folks from Beaver, Harper, and Woodward Counties; all the folks who have donated, places like Love's Travel Stops that have donated so much to be able to move things there; the United Way; Cleanline Energy and their donations; and untold numbers of civic organizations and churches from around that community.  As I looked at many of those folks in the area last week and met with some leaders and pastors in the area, I reminded the folks that the devastation they face is not something that will be recovered from quickly. Springtime will come soon, and the area that is just black earth right now will spring to life with green grass again in the weeks ahead. But the loss of those fence lines, the loss of thousands of animals, the loss of homes, the loss of structures, will take a very long time for the folks--the farmers and ranchers who don't live on a high profit margin.  I have continued to encourage the pastors and churches in that area to walk alongside some families who will have a hard time recovering from this for a long time. I have encouraged our Oklahoma agencies and our Federal agencies to do what we can to be able to step in with repairing fence lines and helping them recover from a very traumatic event.  My wife and I stood with a rancher who talked about going out into the field after the fire. His home was completely destroyed. As he traveled out to the field around him checking on his cattle, he found dead cattle but also found cattle with their faces completely burned, blinded, with coyotes chasing them down. He said all he could do was stand there in the field and cry. These are going to be long days.  I am grateful that there are neighbors taking care of neighbors. I am proud of the people of Oklahoma watching out for each other. As we walk through this, God willing, we will continue to be able to hug and take care of our neighbors in the days ahead.  I want to tell this Senate and the people of the United States that this was a wildfire as big as the State of Rhode Island, and many people haven't even heard of it. But I can assure all of you that the folks in Oklahoma have experienced it, and we will walk through it together as a  With that, Mr.President, I yield back.

7584,topic-id,728,"Mr.Speaker, first let me thank Congressman Veasey for yielding and for his tireless work to defend rights and justice. Also to Congresswoman Plaskett, I thank the gentlewoman for continuing to speak out, to organize us, and for her stellar representation of her district.  Mr.Speaker, in his first week as President, Donald Trump advanced dangerous conspiracy theories and enacted a Muslim ban that undermines our Nation's standing in the world. These actions show that President Trump will peddle his alternative facts no matter the consequences.                              {time}  2015  Now, let me be clear. This approach to governance threatens our democracy and our national security. We must resist it. For starters, we cannot allow President Trump to erode our right to vote. Access to the ballot box is the cornerstone of American democracy, yet he spent his first week in office peddling the baseless myth that 3 to 5 million voted illegally in our election.  Mr.Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Both Republicans and Democrats have dismissed this myth as unsubstantiated, but the President continues to insist that millions of fraudulent voters cost him the popular vote.  Let's call this what it is. This is a campaign by our highest elected official to fabricate reasons why he lost the majority of popular votes. He will use these blatant falsehoods to further undermine access to the voting booth.  Mr.Speaker, this investigation that is being proposed really is a sham. The real attack on America's elections come from Republicans who make it harder for people of color, young people, and low-income people to vote.  I include in the Record an editorial from The New York Times, ``The Voter Fraud Fantasy.''                [From The New York Times, 27, 2017]                        The Voter Fraud Fantasy                            (By Lilli Carre)       There are varying degrees of absurdity in the fallacies      President Trump peddled during his first week in the Oval      Perhaps the most damaging was his insistence that      millions of Americans voted illegally in the election he      narrowly won.       Mr.Trump first made that false claim in late November,      tweeting that he would have won the popular vote ``if you      deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.'' On      Wednesday, he announced that he intended to launch a ``major      investigation'' into voting fraud and suggested the outcome      may justify tightening voting rules.       What once seemed like another harebrained claim by a      president with little regard for the truth must now be      recognized as a real threat to American democracy. Mr.Trump      is telegraphing his administration's intent to provide cover      for longstanding efforts by Republicans to suppress minority      voters by purging voting rolls, imposing onerous      identification requirements and curtailing early voting.       ``This is another attempt to undermine our democracy,''      said Representative Barbara Lee of California, one of the      states where Mr.Trump falsely claimed results were tainted      by large-scale fraud. ``It's about not honoring and      recognizing demographic change.''       The apparent source of Mr.Trump's original claim of mass      voter fraud was Gregg Phillips, a Texas man with a penchant      for making wild allegations about voting fraud. Days before      Mr.Trump's tweet, Mr.Phillips claimed on Twitter that he      had ``verified more than three million votes cast by non-     citizens.'' State election officials across the political      spectrum promptly rejected that assertion, noting that ballot      box fraud in the United States is exceedingly rare.       On Friday, Mr.Trump tweeted that he was looking forward to      seeing the results of an analysis of illegal votes, as      promised by Mr.Republican officials know the voter      fraud claim is an indefensible lie. But few are challenging      Mr.Trump or raising alarms about how severely this hurts our      election system.       Voter suppression initiatives have grown increasingly      common since the Supreme[[Page H729]]     Court invalidated a central provision of the Voting Rights      Act in 2013, making it easier for local authorities to tweak      election rules in a manner that disenfranchises particular      groups of people.       Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department      aggressively fought these efforts. Lawsuits filed by civil      rights advocates and the Justice Department led a federal      appeals court in 2013 to strike down a North Carolina voter      ID law that justices concluded had been designed to target      African-American voters with ``surgical precision.''      Litigation in a similar Texas case is now on hold, pending      guidance from the new attorney general.       If Mr.Trump's attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff      Sessions, is confirmed, the Justice Department will be likely      to all but abandon enforcement of the Voting Rights ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgH723-2.txt,1501,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

Last year alone, hundreds of thousands of minority voters were disenfranchised before and on election day.  Instead of lodging investigations based on alternative facts, President Trump should be investigating the widespread efforts to disenfranchise voters, including the use of outdated voting machines, the mishandling of provisional ballots, the improper purging of voting rolls, and the widely reporting incidents of intimidation and misinformation at the polls.  These are the truth threats to our democracy. If these threats are not enough to occupy President Trump's attention, he should turn to the widespread evidence of Russian interference in our elections. The facts are available and in need of bipartisan investigation, but President Trump has no interest in evaluating facts. He would rather focus on falsehoods.  But the President's attacks on our democracy aren't restricted to alternative facts. This weekend we witnessed the erosion of another American value: our proud tradition as a refuge for immigrants of every religion. The President issued an executive order banning immigrants and refugees from the United States on the basis of religion.  This outrageous executive order to shut people out from several Muslim nations runs counter to our fundamental values that we cherish as It is morally reprehensible and will only make the United States less safe. The order has done nothing but create chaos and fear among refugees and immigrants who have been admitted or have been approved to come to the United  This Nation is, has been, and always will be a nation of immigrants and refugees. This is who we are. We don't turn our back to those in need. And certainly, we do not do so on the basis of religion.  This is a watershed moment for our country, a moment that brings into question our moral character. Thousands of Americans took to the streets to protest the Muslim ban. Really? This is what the resistance must look like.  Tonight, many of us joined our colleagues on the steps of the Supreme Court to demand a reversal of this hateful policy. We will continue to fight every attempt to erode our values to appease ideology and radical special interests.  Our new bill, Statue of Liberty Values Act, known as the SOLVE Act, will reverse President Trump's Muslim ban executive order and ensure that funds or fees shall not be used to implement the order. I hope everyone signs on to Congresswoman Lofgren's bill. The President's order harms our families, our economy, and our national security.  Once again, this is not who we are as a nation.

It suspends entry for 90 days of all immigrants--that is green card holders--and nonimmigrants from seven Muslim majority countries. It also suspends all refugee admission for 120 days.  Now, there has been discussion about the Middle East refugees, but if you look at last year, most of the refugees who came in were from the Congo and[[Page H834]]also from Those individuals who have suffered--they have been tortured--are going to stay in the refugee camps at least for 120 days, and, obviously, this disrupts the program. This will be a much longer end to the refugee program.  Now, there is an exception, and the President has said he wants to let Christian refugees in, and the order itself says minority religions. There is a problem not only with violating the law because the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits discrimination based on nationality and on religion, but also the premise is that Christians who had been persecuted were not admitted as refugees. That is simply false. That is false. There were large numbers of refugees who have been persecuted, including This order violates the Immigration and Nationality It also violates the That is why my bill should be brought up.

His wife and children were moved to the United States because staying in Iraq was too unsafe for them. He is now unable to visit his family in the United He told CBS News: ``We thought we were partners with our American friends, and now we realize we are just considered terrorists.''

7517,topic-id,1874,"Mr.President, I rise again today to share the story of this beautiful young lady, Jessie She is a West Virginian who passed away a year ago last week, and she was only 30 years old. She was a bright young lady with a great future ahead of her.  After years of struggling with heroin addiction, she had been doing very well. She had been sober since August of 2015. She had surgery for an infection related to a running injury and died a day after leaving the hospital.  Her story of addiction is known to many. We have told it many times here. Her father David, a former West Virginia State legislator who served with me, a friend of mine, shared their family struggle with addiction when President Obama traveled to West Virginia to bring attention to the growing opiate epidemic that we are all encountering in all of our  West Virginia has been hit the hardest by the opioid epidemic, where drug overdose deaths soared by more than 700 percent from 1999 to 2013. More than 600 lives were lost last year--just last year alone--to prescription drug overdose, legal prescription drugs.  Jessie's story and her family's pain are all too common in West Virginia and throughout this As I said, we lost 627 West Virginians to opiates last year alone.  When you think about it, this is a pill, this is a product that is manufactured by some of the most regarded institutions, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the country. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which basically says what we can use and what we should consume should be safe for us.  It is then prescribed by the most trusted person who is not in our family--and next to our family is a doctor. You would think that this is something that should be helpful for us, that should be part of the healing process. Instead, it has been part of the killing process. It has no home. It is a silent killer. We kept our mouths shut; we didn't say anything for many years, and now we have an epidemic on our hands, which we are trying to control.  We had 61,000 West Virginians who used prescription pain medications for nonmedical purposes in 2014. This includes 6,000 teenagers. As I have said, our State is not unique. The Presiding Officer's wonderful State of North Carolina is facing the same challenges we are.  Every day in our country, 91 Americans die from a prescription opiate or heroin overdose. Since 1999, we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse.  Jessie's story deeply impacted President Obama, and I spoke with him about her death and the pain her family is going through. He reached out to David and Kate and the entire Grubb family. It is horrific.  When President Obama came to Charleston, Jessie was in a rehab facility in Michigan for the fourth time. Before her life was taken over by addiction in 2009, Jessie's future was bright. She was the beloved daughter of David and Kate Grubb, a beloved sister to her four sisters, and a beloved friend to so many.  She was an excellent student, scoring in the 99th percentile on all of her tests since she had been in education. She was a cheerleader at Roosevelt Junior High School, and she was an avid runner, an athlete.  At the time of her death, she was looking forward to running in her first marathon. She had been training for that. The only trouble she had ever gotten into at school was when she protested the Iraq war, and she was on the right side of that one.  Needless to say, she was a natural-born leader. After graduating from Capital High School, she was thrilled and looking forward to her bright future at the University of North Carolina at  She was sexually assaulted during her first semester, which caused her to withdraw from school and return to The traumatic event that caused Jessie to turn to heroin to escape the pain was that horrific experience.  Over the next 7 years, Jessie would battle her addiction. She would overdose four times and go into rehab four[[Page S1692]]times. Until her death, she had been sober for 6 months and was focused on making a life for herself in All of her hard work was ruined because of a careless mistake.  I introduced this piece of bipartisan legislation; everybody has been so kind on that. It makes so much common sense. I introduced it almost a year ago. At the time, I told David, Kate, and the family: This is something that should be a no-brainer. This is something we should easily pass. It was called Jessie's Law, after this beautiful young lady.  I will explain how the events unfolded, and then I will go into the bill. Her parents, David and Kate, traveled to Michigan for her surgery. They traveled to Michigan, and they told her doctors and the hospital personnel that she was a recovering addict. Jessie confirmed it. She said: Yes, I have struggled. I am clean. I am proud, and I want to get healthy. I want to get my leg injury fixed, and I want to run that marathon.  After Jessie's surgery, the discharging doctor, who said he didn't know she was a recovering addict--the parents were there when she was admitted. She told him. You would have thought they would have asked: Do you have any allergies, penicillin?  You would have thought they would have flagged it: I am a recovering addict.  They sent her home with a prescription for 50 oxycodone--50 oxycodone--because they did not know, because her records had not been properly identified, that she was very prone, being a recovering addict, to any type of opiate. There are other ways of treating pain. Not knowing, the doctor went ahead and released her with what a normal person would get for pain relief.  Needless to say, she should never have gotten that prescription--no way, shape, or form. We must ensure this never happens again. That is why today I am reintroducing Jessie's  Let me tell you what I ran into. David and Kate accompanied her as the parents. They were with their beautiful daughter. They both confirmed that she had an addiction problem and she was recovering: Please, we want you to notify anybody who handles, anyone who dispenses, anyone who is working with Please know what we are dealing with is very fragile.  I said: We will write the legislation. And we did; we wrote the legislation. If you have a consenting guardian, parent, and a consenting patient, it should be flagged. Because of privacy laws, we know we are very concerned about that. For some reason, I cannot get past the bureaucracy of getting this bill to the floor to be voted on because they are saying there is objection to the privacy laws with the parents' being involved. So guess what. I finally called David, and I called Kate, and I said: I know you would think it makes common sense that, basically, we should be able to pass legislation the way we would like to pass it--where the parents acknowledge it and the patient, who is their child, acknowledges it. They both are cooperating, and it should be done.  In order to try to get this piece of legislation passed as quickly as possible, we are taking off the parents. It is only the patient herself. Jessie comes in and says: I want you to know I am a recovering addict. Please make sure that everybody who handles my case knows that. That is all we are asking for. I am hopeful, Mr.President, that you and others will be able to join me because we don't want anybody in North Carolina going through what we have gone through in West Virginia or what the Grubb family has gone through, losing this beautiful, bright, talented young lady. It should never happen in this country.  Even the healthcare providers are saying: We need this legislation to go forward so we can identify that, so we can mark that, hotline that, redline that, and so that anybody who is handling Jessie from the beginning to the end, especially when they are discharged, is going to have knowledge. In no way, shape, or form will anybody prescribe an opiate or any type of addictive painkiller that they are going to be affected by, because their life has been changed by it already.  The bottom line is that we need to go at this problem from every angle with the help of everyone: family assistance, counseling programs, drug courts, consumer and medical education, law enforcement support, State and Federal legislation. We need everything. This is a fight we can't lose.  This is the first time in my lifetime that my State has fallen under 50 percent of adults of working age not working. We are down to 49.6 percent. We have always had the reputation of having some of the greatest workers--hard workers--giving you a good hard-working day for good hard-working pay. They have always been there. We just have too few of them. There are three things that keep you out of the workforce, basically: a lack of skill sets, if you are addicted or you have a criminal record, or a combination. Addiction has taken over and has basically changed the lives of Americans, changed the lives of West Virginia, and it is ruining families.  There is no way that her sisters and David and Kate, her parents, are ever going to get over losing There is no reason they should have lost Jessie and no reason you should lose another North Carolinian--none of us. As to the situation where they are go in and they are identified by all the professionals with the help they need in the systems they are asking for, we owe that to every person in America, and we owe it to  So I am asking for the cooperation of all my colleagues--the continuous support, tireless work that everyone has done. Jessie's death is heartbreaking and reminds us all that this is one death that could have been prevented and one death that should never happen again because of a lack of legislation that prevents us, because of the privacy laws, to identify a person that is in need.  If you are looking at addiction and happen to be looking at addiction as an illness, an illness needs care. If they need care, then we are going to give them the care to protect them while they are getting that care. That is all this does. I hope it is something we can do as quickly as possible. We will be forever grateful. In Jessie's memory, her parents are going to be forever grateful. Basically, Jessie's life will not be in vain. That is exactly why I am here. I am not going to sit still and lose a beautiful person who could contribute to society the way this young lady was going to contribute to society and say there is nothing we can do. We can do it and do it in her honor.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1691.txt,1983,RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS,2017.0,8.0,February
7656,topic-id,1463,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Sam Johnson and[[Page H836]]Ralph Abraham, for sponsoring this joint resolution. I would also like to point out that my colleague from Colorado is a member of the Second Amendment Caucus, and he has been working hard on this issue.  H.40 would strike down a rule that was finalized by the Social Security Administration just days before the close of the 114th This rule is yet another example of the previous administration's last-ditch efforts to attack our Second Amendment rights.  Any attempt to curtail the right of Americans to defend themselves and their liberty is untenable. This scheme is particularly appalling because of whom it targets and how the administration sought to implement the rule.  The rule targets our grandparents, our elderly mothers and fathers who have been awarded disability benefits and have had a family member or guardian appointed to handle their finances. They haven't committed a crime or demonstrated that they were a danger to society. There is no trial, no presumption of innocence. Their names are sent to the NICS database and their firearms are taken away, their right to own a firearm.  Hardened criminals don't have their rights violated to that extent without due process, so why would it be acceptable for our seniors?  These men and women have worked hard to raise families, worked a job, and paid their fair share of taxes. Now they are being told that, in order to receive their Social Security benefits, they must first surrender the fundamental right to defend themselves. Is this the level of pettiness to which we have sunk?  The House and the American people have soundly rejected gun control in all of its forms year after year; yet this last administration bypassed the legislative process, imposed a rule, and completely disregarded due process in order to strip seniors of their constitutional rights. Our seniors deserve better than that.  This rule is not about protecting anyone. This rule should be seen for what it truly is: awful, politically motivated, and a dangerous infringement on our Second Amendment rights.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I am not sure where to begin, because I have heard so many fascinating things here today.  The distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee said we are here today to enunciate the rules. I don't know what there is to enunciate. The only thing to enunciate is this is a closed rule. It is yet another closed rule. There is no opportunity to have any real deliberation, no real discussion. On top of that, there were no hearings on any of this stuff.  No matter what your position is, I have to be honest with you, listening to the gentleman, Mr.Massie, just speak, I think it would have been nice if the Judiciary Committee could have actually had a hearing on this and maybe delved into some of the issues that the gentleman raised.  When people say that there is no due process, I would remind them that, under the rule, impacted beneficiaries are notified that this determination is being considered and they are provided a process to challenge that determination. Should the Social Security Administration determine that that recipient is able to safely use or possess guns, rights are restored and the person's name is removed from That is what it says.  Now, if there is a way to improve this, I am all for improving it; but by passing this measure here today, you prevent the agencies that are impacted here from ever being able to revisit the issue unless Congress deemed it appropriate.  So we are not trying to fix anything here. Basically, what we are doing is the bidding of the National Rifle Association to eliminate anything aimed at protecting people from gun violence in this country.  The gentleman from Colorado talked about the fact that his constituents want the right to protect their rights for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Well, my constituents want that, too, but they have a right to not have to be victims of gun violence. They have a right to protect their loved ones who may use a weapon against themselves or their family members.  But again, we can have this argument on whether or not we should do more--and I believe we should--to protect people in this country from gun violence, but that discussion ought to have happened first in the Judiciary Committee, at a minimum, not in the Rules I am on the Rules I admire the intellect of everybody on the Rules Committee, but our expertise is not on judiciary matters.  Similarly, on the other rule that is being repealed, the Financial Services Committee should have deliberated on that. I think there are some serious issues raised by repealing that rule, issues that I think go to the heart of corruption not only here in the United States, but around the world.  When the chairman of the Rules Committee got up and gave his description that somehow the U.oil companies are only being singled out, it makes my case why we should have had a hearing. What he just said, in my opinion, does not reflect reality.  The fact of the matter is, I looked at section 1504 of Dodd-It doesn't just require all extractive companies in the U.It says that all extractive companies, U.and foreign, listed on the U.exchanges are to publicly disclose the payments they make to governments for oil, gas, and mining resources.                              {time}  1315  And then, on top of that--and I said this earlier--is that other countries have followed suit. Canada and the European Union and Norway have all passed similar laws. It is not just the United States being singled out. That is just wrong. Maybe, if we had a hearing in the committee of jurisdiction, that would have been clear, and this wouldn't be a point of contention.  The fact of the matter is, it is a simple reporting requirement. It places no limits or restrictions on who companies can pay money to or how much or for what. It has absolutely no regulatory effect on any aspect of their business operations. There is absolutely no benefit to nullifying this commonsense law unless your objective is to make it easier for corrupt elites to steal money. The rule has no regulatory impact on business operation and does not define illegal or improper payments. It is a simple reporting requirement.  There is a problem with corruption, especially in places like Now, I know with the new administration, Russia is now in, and we are all supposed to say nice things about But Russia has a terrible record on human rights, and Russia has a terrible record when it comes to corruption, and we know that. We ought to not just cave to everything that Russia wants, and Russia and Big Oil want this repealed.  So I would say to my colleagues that we can argue about the merits of all of this, and that is fine, but I go back to my original point. This is the rule, and the Speaker of the House talked about the importance of regular order. I have heard my colleagues talk about the importance of regular order. We don't have regular order. You are all out of order. We end up coming to the floor with legislation that is always under restrictive processes, and most of the time now, in this new Congress, completely closed rules. That doesn't just disadvantage Democratic lawmakers who may have some ideas or may want to raise some issues, it disadvantages Republicans who may want to come to the floor with thoughtful ideas.  I urge my colleagues to absolutely vote ``no'' on this rule because, again, we are getting into this habit where it is closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, and it undermines the integrity of this House of It really is shameful.  Finally, I will urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can have a debate and a vote on overturning President Trump's awful, discriminatory executive orders on immigration. It jeopardizes our national security. It was carelessly implemented, carelessly put together. It is shameful. It is unconscionable that we are confronted with the mess that we are confronted with now.  I know it is uncomfortable to talk about issues that impact the new President who is of your party, but this[[Page H837]]is absolutely the right thing to do. And if you want to vote no on these things, vote no on them, but allow us to have the debate and allow us to have the vote. I urge ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the rule.

More debt, under a solidly unified Republican Congress and a Republican  So you might scratch your head and say: The more things change, the more they stay the same. Is it all smoke and mirrors? Isthere really a difference? Are Republicans different than Democrats? It is a pretty important question. We are in such a hurryto repeal I am all for it. As a physician, nobody thinks that ObamaCare has been worse for the country. Nobody morethan me thinks it is a terrible piece of legislation that has not helped the country and that has inflated our costs and nothelped. Yet do we have to add nearly $10 trillion of debt in order to get at it?  So as this moves forward, I will offer a replacement. I will offer my own budget. I will offer to strike and remove $10trillion worth of debt, and I will offer my own budget that balances within 5 years. How do we do it? We give the authority tomake the cuts where they should be, where they are most wasteful in government, and we offer this budget by simply freezingexpenditures. You don't have to cut any expenditures.  Every department of government could get what they got the last year. If you think some departments of government need moremoney, cut other departments of government. Frankly, there are some departments of government you could eliminate and you wouldnever know they were gone. If the Department of Commerce were gone, a few corporate executives would not be able to fly aroundon government jets. They could fly around on their own jets. You would never know the whole entire Department of Commerce wasgone.  You can cut spending. You can actually get to the balance by not cutting anything. So here is what happens. If you freezethe on-budget spending, within a little over 5 years, your budget balances.  I remember a time when there were the moderates who were for freezing spending, and the real conservatives were for cuttingspending. Now nobody is for cutting spending. When I bring it up that you can absolutely not balance the budget if you are notwilling to look at entitlements, do you know what I am told by many well-meaning Republicans? Don't write it down. Don't put iton paper because people will be upset with you if you explain that to save Social Security, to save Medicare, you will have toreform these entitlement programs. They say: Let's just talk about waste. Let's just talk about fraud and abuse. And I do, andwe should eliminate all of those. But guess what. If you eliminate all of the budgetary spending that we vote on--this is calledthe discretionary spending. This would be the military and all the rest of the nonmilitary. It is about $1 trillion, notincluding the entitlements--Social Security, Medicare, and If you did just the military and the nonmilitary and youreduced it 10 percent a year for 10 years, and you virtually wiped out all discretionary spending, you still don't balance thebudget.  So, really, you are not a conservative if you are not willing to look at all government spending. The budget cannot bebalanced and the budget will never balance unless we look at entitlements.  What does that mean? It means that because of demographics--we had big families 60 years ago, with three, four, five kids toa family. Now we have less than three kids to a family--probably two kids to a family. So you had all the baby boomers born rightafter World War II, and they are all retiring--60 million of them. So we have this huge population boom, and you don't have asmany workers. So the demographics aren't working. Then you add to that the fact that we are living longer.  When Social Security was started, the average life expectancy was 65. It worked pretty well as a pension plan because youdied. But now it is great. We are living on average to 80, and if you make 80, you may well make 90. What a greatthing--longevity. But it is not working. Social Security is not working. We spend more on recipients than we bring in with thetax.  Medicare is even worse. The average taxpayer pays about $100,000 over their lifetime in Medicare taxes. The averagerecipient takes out $350,000. How big a problem is this? Medicare is $35 trillion to $40 trillion in the whole.  It is inexcusable that we are not talking about how we fix It is inexcusable that we are not talking about how tofix Social If we don't fix them, there is going to be a cliff. Within about a decade, the cliff is so severe thateveryone on Social Security will suffer a 20-percent decline in their monthly check. It will happen all at once if we don't fixit. Can we fix it? Yes, we have to talk about it.  What we are doing today is kicking the can down the road. We have our focus on ObamaCare, but we are taking our focus offthe debt. As bad a problem as ObamaCare is, as much as it has disturbed, destroyed, and distorted the health care market, it maybe that the debt is a bigger problem.  So it is not a popular stand that I take today. I will be the only Republican to vote against the Republican budget. Thatwon't be popular. But I ran for office. I left my medical practice. I am away from my family. I spend long hours traveling herebecause I am concerned about the debt.  We borrow $1 million a minute. The debt threatens the very foundation of our country. Yet here we are. The Republican Partycontrols the House, the Senate, and the White House, and in their haste, they put forward a budget that is going to add thismuch debt.  This is what the debt has been doing. Here is 1980. We see the growth. It has become exponential--the growth of the debt.This should worry every But here is the Republican 10-year budget that we are getting ready to pass. It is virtually avertical line of accumulation of debt.  People will say: But how could we ever cut any spending? I will give you a couple of examples of where your governmentspends money and you tell me whether or not we ought to look long and hard at cutting spending.  There was a grant given for autism. I have a great deal of sympathy. I know children with autism. The grant was for$700,000. But do you know what they spent it on? They spent it on studying Neil Armstrong's statement. Remember Neil Armstrong?He landed on the moon and said: ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''  Well, your government, in its infinite wisdom, wanted to know: Did he say ``one small step for man'' or ``one small step fora man''? Your government spent $700,000 studying the preposition ``a.'' Did he say ``a man'' or just ``man''--$700,000. Moneythat should have been spent on autism was spent on something frivolous.  Is anybody going to fix it? Every year, all of the spending bills are globbed together in a 2,000-page bill--and not oneiota of reform.  My colleagues may remember that Senator Proxmire from the 1970s used to have something called the ``Golden Fleece Award.''Every one of those things he complained about in the 1970s happens now but tenfold greater. Nobody fixes it. We don't passindividual spending bills. We do continuing resolutions, which means we continue doing the same thing we have done over andover.  Again, $700,000 was spent studying Neil Armstrong's statement. Do you know what their conclusion was? We are not sure. Theyspent $700,000, and they are still not sure whether he said ``a man'' or ``one small step for man.''  We spent $500,000 studying whether or not, when you take a selfie, if you are smiling in the selfie, does it ultimately makeyou feel better? We spent $500,000.[[Page S40]]  So what do we do? Do we give these people less money? Teach them a lesson. Give them less money, and maybe they willconserve the money. Maybe they will eliminate waste if they have less money next year than they had this year--or what I amproposing: Freeze the spending. Is anybody proposing that? We say: They spend a half a million dollars on selfies; give themmore next year.  So the Republican budget will increase spending every year. It increases spending at about 5 percent a year. So spending goes up. They say it is the baseline, and they say we are cutting off the baseline. No, no. Thebaseline goes up 5 percent a year. Spending will increase over the 10-year period. The red line is spending.  Part of that is what the Republicans are proposing. They are going to stay on the spending curve. If we stay on the spendingcurve, they will continue to spend $700,000 studying Neil Armstrong's statement; they will continue to spend half a milliondollars on selfies. They spent another half a million dollars on a climate change game. They spent $45 million to build anatural gas station in Afghanistan--$45 million. The first problem: Nobody in Afghanistan has a car that runs on natural gas.They discovered this after they built the gas station. The gas station was 86 times cost overrun. The original estimate wasabout half a million for the gas station, but lo and behold, somehow it cost $45 million. If your government had 86 times costoverrun, would you give them more money or give them less money? I, frankly, think we should give them less money. If you givethem more money, they will not waste it less; they will waste it the same or worse. They should be given less money.  Mazar-e Sharif is a city in northern We built an $85 million embassy there and we signed a 10-year lease, andthen somebody looked at the place and decided that since there were tall buildings surrounding the entire entity, people wouldshoot down into the courtyard and kill our diplomats, and they said the building could never been occupied--after they spent 85billion, after they signed a 10-year lease. How will they get better? Were the people who made this decision fired? They areFederal employees, and you never fire Federal employees. Will they make wiser decisions because we give them less money? Wegive them more money.  You would be excused for being upset if you went and voted and said ``I am going to vote for the conservative party'' and ifyou went and voted and said ``I am going to vote for the party that is going to balance a budget.'' Wouldn't you be upset?Wouldn't you wonder which party that is?  This is the spending curve. We are going to add $9.7 trillion in 10 years, and yet they say: Oh, no, this isn't really abudget.  I have it in front of me, though. It is a budget.  There is no reason why Republicans couldn't have put forward a budget that doesn't add all the red ink. We are at $20trillion. We are going to nearly $30 trillion under the Republican plan. My goodness, what happened? Where is the conservativeparty? Where are the conservatives in Congress who would say enough is enough? Now they say: We just have to be done with this.Don't distract the little people. Don't let the people of the country know we are voting on a budget. We are going to call thisthe vehicle to repeal  Well, that is not what it is. It is a budget. And we have special rules for dealing with the budget that allow us to repealObamaCare, which I am all for, but this is a budget.  They say: Well, how can we get the votes? No Democrats will vote for this budget. This is a Republican blueprint. Not oneDemocrat will vote for this.  So this is what Republicans are for. This is the blueprint the Republican Party says they are for--$10 trillion worth of newdebt. I am not for it. That is not why I ran for office. That is not why I am here. That is not why I spend time away from myfamily and my medical practice. It is because debt is consuming our country. There is a time and a place to debate ObamaCare,and I am more than willing to debate that. But this is a budget. This is the vote on a budget.  They say: Oh, it is just a gimmick. It is just a game. The numbers don't mean anything.  Well, if the numbers don't mean anything, put honest numbers in there or put conservative numbers in there.  I, for one, will put forward a conservative opposition to the Republican majority's budget. I will put forward a budget thatfreezes spending and balances the budget over a 5-year period. Would there be some agencies that would get less money? Butit would force us to go through the government and pick and choose what is good spending and what is not good spending.  We have a waste report that we put out. If you look on our Facebook, you can find our waste report. I listed four or five ofthe most egregious. There are hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of things we shouldn't be spending money on. I will giveanother example.  We have sold $100 billion worth of weapons to Saudi They were wanting to spend money giving F-16s to Youpay for them and give them to them.  There is riddled throughout the Pentagon--look, the Pentagon has never been audited. You are surprised? The government hasnever been audited. The Federal Reserve is not audited. The Pentagon is not audited. So what is the Pentagon's response to beingaudited? The Pentagon says to us: We are too big to be audited. I don't know about you, but that makes me kind of angry, that apart of our government, even a necessary part such as national defense, says they are too big to be audited. Meanwhile, we have$85 million embassies built that will never be occupied and $45 million gas stations that will never be used.  I think it is time that we say enough is enough. Don't give government more money; give them less. The government hasn'tbeen a good steward of your money.  The question is often asked: Are the people who spend your money, are the people involved in government inherently stupid?It is kind of a debatable question. I think they are mostly well-intentioned. I don't think they are inherently stupid, but I dothink they don't get the right incentives. Because there is no profit motive in government, because there is no rationale ormotive to conserve, money is spent, and because of sheer laziness and ineptitude, we continue to pass the spending bills--glommedtogether, thousands of pages--without reform. But I won't be party to that. I won't vote for spending bills that are notindividualized and don't have reforms in them. I won't vote for budgets that never balance.  So while I may be a lonely voice on this issue, I will continue to bring up to the American people that it is important notto add more debt, that it is important to slow down the accumulation of debt. It is important that we have a $20 trillion debt,and I am not willing to add $10 trillion more in debt. So at the appropriate time, I will introduce an amendment that willstrike and replace this budget, and in its place I will put forward a conservative vision for the country--a vision of a balancedbudget that balances within 5 years.  Every Republican in the Congress who has been here for a while has voted for a balanced budget amendment. Interestingly, thebalanced budget amendment--which would be an amendment to the Constitution--has within it a provision that the budget wouldbalance within 5 years. And even when Republicans get around to saying ``Oh, we will have some gimmicks to balance in 10,'' 10is not what the amendment says. Why bother voting on an amendment if you are not serious about it?  Republicans are completely in charge. It is a Republican document; it is a document I disagree with; and at the appropriatetime, I will be introducing a replacement that will balance within 5 years and provide a conservative view for the country.

7580,topic-id,381,"Mr.Speaker, first let me thank the gentleman from Fort Worth and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for heading these Special Order hours. It is an honor that I had prior to them, and I am sure that they see the importance of being able to spearhead topics that are important for today.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud are unsubstantiated. Officials in both parties have said that there is no evidence of large-scale voter fraud. A comprehensive investigation found only 31 possible cases of impersonation fraud out of 1 billion votes cast in all elections between 2000 and 2014. President Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8 million, and it looks like he is looking for an excuse.  What is worse is that President Trump's unfounded claims will encourage Republicans to double down on their assault on voting rights. There is no significant evidence of fraud, but President Trump's claims will be used as cover to suppress the vote. He is already talking about launching a major investigation into nonexistent voter fraud. The only thing that would come from such an investigation would be further restrictions on voting rights.  If President Trump wants to investigate anything, he should investigate the real voter fraud talking place--the Republican-led attempts to suppress minority votes.  The strategy of Republican legislatures in some States has been to suppress votes by instituting voter ID laws, reducing hours for early voting, and closing polling places. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, in 2016, 14 States had new voting restrictions in place for the first time in a Presidential election. This Presidential election was the first in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights  As a country, we should make it as easy as possible for people to exercise the right to vote. Election officials should not erode our democratic principles. They should make sure that every American citizen has an equal voice in the democratic process.  Protecting every person's right to vote is essential to a fully functioning democracy. The countless men and women who have risked their lives to defend that right knew our system of government only works when it is inclusive and fair, when it enables all voices to have a say in the future of our country.

Mr.Speaker, we are here tonight to speak to those two very important issues that go to the fabric of our founding: our ability to grow, diversify as a Nation, by bringing in the tired and the poor, the innovators, the ones who bring new changes to this country, and continue its dynamic growth, as well as voting rights.  Last week, President Trump--among a number of other things--expressed unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 Presidential election. The remarks that we heard would appear to be inaccurate, reckless, and dangerous to our democracy in some of our opinions.  Mr.Speaker, my colleagues and I are here this evening to highlight the real voter fraud in this country, and that is the continued attempts to suppress minority voting rights across many States as well as the outright denial of the right to vote for millions of Americans living in the territories.  I want to underscore that the fight for equal voting rights for minorities in this country did not end with the passage of the Voting Rights  In fact, today, more than 50 years after our esteemed colleague John Lewis and others courageously marched on Selma, we have seen the United States Supreme Court strike down one of its most important protections.  Within hours of that decision, States were already moving forward with restrictive voter ID laws, which had already been rejected as discriminatory under the Voting Rights  Six of the 16 States that passed voter ID laws since 2010 have a documented history of discriminating against minority voters.  The State of Alabama, in 2014, began enforcing a controversial voter ID law that required voters to show a State-issued ID in order to vote, and then announced plans to close 31 driver's license offices--most of them, ironically, in rural, impoverished, majority Black counties--making it even harder for residents to get the most common form of ID used to vote.  In addition to the Supreme Court's action, a Federal Court in a 2015 ruling used a racist, century-old opinion of the Supreme Court to uphold the denial of voting rights to American citizens in my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, and the citizens and residents of America's island territories.  They are called the insular cases, and the opinion was authored, ironically, by the same justice who wrote Plessy v.  March marks 100 years that my district has been a part of this country, but our service dates back to its very founding through the Virgin Islander and Founding Father Alexander He would be, I think, very upset to find out that people from the island in which he came could not vote for their President and Commander in Chief, even though the Virgin Islands and the territories have the highest rates of military service in the United States and have exponentially higher rates of casualties per capita in the wars in Afghanistan and We believe we have earned the right to take part in this democracy.  In another example, last year, a Federal appeals court decisively struck down a North Carolina voter identification law and noted its provisions deliberately ``target African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' That is a quote of the court in an effort to depress Black turnout at the polls. That, to me, sounds like voter fraud and voter suppression.  Mr.Speaker, these are just a few examples of the real voter fraud happening across this country.  The members of this caucus continue to work to ensure that all American citizens, regardless of their race, income or location, can participate in this great democracy; and we implore the President to direct his efforts to investigate voter fraud at these and other issues.  We want to, as the Congressional Black Caucus, address another issue, because we don't just represent African Americans or minorities here in this country. We want to address an issue that is of great concern to me and members of this caucus--and as demonstrated by massive protests this weekend and right across the street here this evening at the Supreme Court--the concern of a large majority of America, and that is the President's executive order to ban refugees entering into this country.  Banning entry to people fleeing persecution is perhaps as diametrically opposed to the foundational fabric of this country as you can get.  Mr.Speaker, not only is the President's refugee ban mean-spirited and misguided, it undermines our democracy, undermines our efforts to thwart terrorism, and is an affront to all who have sacrificed to defend it.  Viewing all refugees fleeing as suspects shows an extremely myopic understanding of the real threats and plays to extremist propaganda.  The refugee ban will not make us safe. It would have done nothing to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks, nor the others that followed. The terrorists of those attacks were American citizens, some of whom were even on the terrorist watch list and still allowed to legally purchase deadly weapons used to carry out their terrorist plot.  If this President and Congress want to protect the American people from terrorism, they should pass the no fly, no buy legislation that House Democrats stood to support.  Mr.Speaker, there are many of my colleagues here this evening who would love to speak on this issue.

Mr.Chair, it was our first commander-in-chief, George Washington, who said, and I paraphrase, that we can never expect young men and women to rise to the occasion to fight for our country and for our freedom unless we take care of those who have already sacrificed on the battlefield. So the wonderful thing about serving on the Committee for Veterans Affairs, Mr.Chair, is that it is completely bipartisan.  This is all about our veterans. We just love them in the State of Maine--66,000 veterans strong in our Second District of Maine, Mr.We have one of the highest percentages of our population that are veterans in the country, and we are very, very proud of that.  I must say that, in my dealings with Togus--which is, by the way, Mr.Chair, the first military hospital in the country. It is about 150 years old now. They set up to take care of our Civil War veterans about 150 years ago.  In any event, in talking with the folks at Togus, they made it very clear to me, Mr.Chair, that one of their biggest problems they have, and it is ongoing, is: How do we hire quickly and retain the best quality doctors, nurses, and medical technicians to care for our heroes?  That is why I am so excited and grateful for this opportunity to vote for H.1367, because it helps solve one of these problems. It removes red tape in the hiring process.

So I am encouraging all of my fellow colleagues here, Republicans and Democrats, to make sure they vote for this bill, H.1367, because our best fought for us, Mr.Chair, our best fought for us.

I will just talk about the two most egregious things from this past week, which are the allegations of voter fraud and his nomination of a person to run the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and his unconstitutional ban on  Since 2010, 20 States have restricted voting rights by enacting discriminatory voter ID and proof of citizenship laws, illegally purging thousands of proper voters from the rolls, cutting back early voting, limiting voter registration, and engaging in other suppressive tactics. These laws were put in place to combat the notion of voter fraud despite the fact that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United  More than a dozen recent investigations and studies all show voter fraud to be virtually nonexistent. A 2014 Washington Post investigation found 31 incidents of voter fraud in the more than 1 billion ballots that were cast in elections at all levels of government from 2000 to 2014. Of the more than 137 million ballots cast in the 2016 election, election and law enforcement officials in all 50 States have yet to report any indications of widespread voter fraud.  But, if there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, what reason could anyone have, including the President, for this claim? The truth is that Republicans have used the voter fraud lie to restrict voting rights for years. Voter ID laws have been sponsored by Republicans and have been passed overwhelmingly by Republican legislatures.  Richard Posner, a conservative U.circuit court judge appointed by President Reagan, has called the concerns about voter fraud a mere fig leaf that is intended to justify laws that appear to be aimed at limiting voting by minorities, especially In July 2016, a U.circuit court struck down North Carolina's law, calling it the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim The judges charged that Republican lawmakers had targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.  Let me just turn very briefly to the President's ill-advised, unconstitutional executive order that purportedly promotes national security. Keeping America safe is a top priority for all of us, but this order is wrong. It is wrong because it makes us less safe, and it is wrong because it goes against our American values. This is the latest in President Trump's series of actions that shows that his number one priority is short-term shows of intolerance instead of the long-term security of the American people.  Actions by the Oval Office directly affect people's lives. When the President is making policy up on the fly, it has real harmful consequences in the lives of everyday The fact that the Secretary of Homeland Security--a committee in Congress on which I serve--was not included in discussions about implementing the executive order, even though this Department is in charge of its implementation, is clear evidence of a broken system. Shutting out the mothers, children, fathers, and families who are fleeing the same violence that we fight against is exactly what ISIS and similar groups want us to do, and it only strengthens their hands. This haphazard order does nothing to keep Americans safe. In fact, it hurts our efforts to fight against terrorism.  Let me just say, Mr.Speaker, to my colleague from Texas that the President of the United States, when addressing Liberty University, cited ``2 Corinthians,'' while most church-going people in the country would say ``Second Corinthians.'' He cited 2 Corinthians 2:17, which reads, wherever the Lord is, there is liberty and freedom, but there can't be liberty and freedom without meaningful access to the voting polls. He didn't need to get to chapter 3. He really could have just stopped at the first few paragraphs of the Second Corinthians, which read: ``Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . who comforts us in our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble.''  The question becomes: Why go to Liberty University and offer your Christian values?  It always talks about the least of these in the Bible and what we are doing to help others and to do unto others as you would have them do unto you so that, as soon as mothers and children and families are fleeing persecution and certain death, we put a wall up around our country, shut down our airports, and say: We don't care what trouble you are in. You just can't come here.  That goes against everything that this country was founded on.

This legislation supports our Armed Forces by helping pay our troops and provide care for our men and women in uniform and their families, and it gives our military the resources necessary to combat terrorism, deter our adversaries, and support our allies.  The Defense Appropriations bill includes a 2.1 percent pay raise for our servicemen and -women, which will help our military families like those who are currently struggling in Nevada to make ends meet.  One of the most important investments proposed is increasing our military readiness, which helps strengthen our national security.

7508,topic-id,529,"Mr.President, finally, on a separate topic, I did want to take this moment to recognize someone I am proud to represent in the He is a fellow Floridian and a constituent by the name of Tim By now, a lot of people know I am proud to be a University of Florida alum. So as a proud Gator fan, I have been rooting for Tim Tebow since he first stepped foot on campus in 2006.  He went on to win two national championships, becoming the first sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy, and in the process he rewrote the record books. When I was the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, we hosted the Gators championship team. One of my favorite memories of my time in State government was catching a pass from Tim Tebow--15--on the floor of the Florida It was not a great pass, but I caught it. The rules are a little different in the I wish it were OK to throw passes in here, but it was a great pleasure to be able to do that.  From the moment Tim arrived in Gainesville, we football fans saw that he was as good as advertised on the field, but we also started learning that as good a football player as he is, he is an even more extraordinary human being off the field.  He is a man to much has been given, whether it was the chance to be born to two great parents, an incredible support network, and of course He has been given much, and he has given back even more. We saw this once again this past Friday, when the Tim Tebow Foundation held its Night to Shine Initiative, an annual prom for special needs students from all over the world.  All told, 375 churches participated as Night to Shine hosts in all 50 States, 11 countries, and on 6 continents. There were 150,000 volunteers, and 75,000 special needs students were the guests of honor at events across the world. I encourage those of you here today or watching this or watching this in the future to Google search Night to Shine, to visit Tim Tebow's Facebook page, or to see the hashtag ``Night to Shine'' on There you will see all of the photos that have been shared from Friday night's events. You will see 75,000 young people with special needs having the time of their lives. You will see volunteers and teachers and especially parents overcome with joy and emotion at the sight of their children feeling as loved, as important, and as special as each and every one of them truly is.  Personally, I was very moved. So I wanted to take a few minutes this evening to recognize Tim Tebow, the Tebow Foundation, the churches and the volunteers who participated, and all of the incredible students and parents who inspire us every day. I know I speak on behalf of the entire Gator Nation--I should say the entire State of Florida--in saying that we are proud of We are even prouder of all he has done and continues to do.

7703,topic-id,1822,"Mike Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming, is a friend of mine. He comes from a beautiful rural State--Icome from a beautiful rural State--That is probably the end of our commonality. We look at the world very differently,and I hope that in the course of this debate, the American people will see the very profound differences we have not only onhealth care, not only on tax policy, not only on the deficit, but on many other important issues.  What we are looking at right now is a budget process whose ultimate goal is to remove health insurance from tens of millionsof Let's be clear. Today, the United States of America is the only major country on Earth that--I live 50 miles awayfrom the Canadian border. Many of us have visited We are the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. It is something I passionately believe in. I believe that health care for all is a human right. Ihad hoped we would work together to figure out what is a complicated issue as to how we can move forward to guarantee healthcare to all people in a cost-effective way, but that is not what we are debating today.  Let's be very clear. The Republican plan--their budget plan--lays the groundwork for ending the Affordable Care Act, whichwill remove tens of millions of Americans from the health insurance they get. There is nothing wrong with change. We can alwaysimprove.  I hope that during the course of this debate, my Republican friends who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act will comedown and tell us what their plan is, how, in fact, they are going to provide quality, cost-effective health care to allWell, you know what. They all voted against the Affordable Care Senator Enzi is right--we did not get oneRepublican to vote for it. They have had 8 years to think about how they are going to come up with a new plan, and I would hopebut I do not expect one Republican to come to the floor and say: Oh yeah, we are going to throw 20, 30 million people out oftheir health insurance. This is our new plan. This is how we are going to provide health care to those people.  They have no ideas. Their theme is to repeal and then delay. Someday they are going to come up with a new plan. You don'tdestroy a house without having another house in which people can live. You don't throw 30 million people off of health carewithout having a plan to provide health care to those people.  Under the Republican proposal--something many Republicans have been talking about for years--they want to end Medicare as itpresently exists, a program that is life-and-death for millions of seniors. They want to voucherize Medicare, give people acheck, and then let them go to the private insurance market and get the best deal they can.  Imagine that you are an 85-year-old senior citizen who has been diagnosed with cancer and you get your check for whatever itmay be. We don't know what it will be--$7,000, $8,000, $9,000.[[Page S34]]You go to the insurance company and you say: I have $9,000. Iam 85. I have been diagnosed with cancer. I want you to take care of me. Give me an insurance program that will take care of mymedical needs, my hospital needs.  The insurance agent will laugh in your face because $9,000 or $8,000 will last you, at most, for 1 week.  That is their plan.  I have been all over the country, and right now the American people are outraged at the high cost of prescription drugs inthis country--let's be clear--because of the power of the pharmaceutical industry and their lobbying and their campaigncontributions--a power that exists, by the way, not only influencing Republicans but too many Democrats as well. We pay thehighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In fact, one out of six Americans who goes to a doctor to get a prescriptionfor an illness cannot even afford to fill the prescription. Yet, under the Republican proposal, if you eliminate the AffordableCare Act, the doughnut hole fix, which now helps seniors pay for their prescription drugs, will be eliminated and prescriptiondrugs for seniors could rise by as much as 50 percent.  By the way, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on Earth, when the veryrich are getting richer while the middle class shrinks, the Republican proposal not only throws 20 to 30 million people off ofhealth insurance, not only raises the price of prescription drugs for seniors, not only moves forward to privatize Medicare,but, shock of all shocks, our Republican colleagues want to give massive tax breaks to the top 2 percent.  Among many other negative impacts that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act will have will be one that will impact heavilyrural States, such as Wyoming, Vermont, and other rural States around this country; that is, as a result of the repeal of theAffordable Care Act, rural hospitals could be forced to close their doors--not getting the funding they need--leaving millions ofAmericans with nowhere to turn for critical medical care.  I look forward to this debate. Nobody here thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect. Nobody believes that at all. The goalis how we repair it, how we improve it, how we expand health care to more Americans, how we end what has been the case fordecades in this country--that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world per capita for health care. Maybe we shouldunderstand that we are the only major country in the world that allows private insurance companies to profit off of people'sillness.  The proposal being brought forth by the Republicans is not only poorly thought out, it really is not popular. It is not whatthe American people want. Go to your hometowns and ask people--at a time when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as muchwealth as the bottom 90 percent, when the top 1 percent is earning 52 percent of all new income, go out and ask yourconstituents whether we should give huge tax breaks to the top 2 percent, and they don't think that is a good idea.  According to a poll released this month by POLITICO and Morning Consult, 80 percent of the American people think the FederalGovernment should be spending more money on Only 10 percent think we should be spending less. Seventy-one percent ofthe American people think we should be spending more on  So 84 percent of the American people think the Federal Government should be spending more on Social In otherwords, the proposal we are seeing from the Republicans today is way, way out of touch from where the American people are.  There is another issue out there that I find extremely interesting. Senator Enzi mentioned--and, of course, he isright--that within a couple of weeks we are going to have a new Donald Trump will be inaugurated as President, and itis interesting that we listened to what Donald Trump said during the campaign. The Democrats heard what he had to say during thecampaign, what he campaigned on, and more importantly, Republicans, listened and heard what their leader had to say about theseissues. This is what Donald Trump said, and he didn't say it once in the middle of the night. He didn't say it in an interview.This was a central part of his campaign. This is what he asked millions of elderly people and working-class people to vote forhim on. These are the principles that Donald Trump ran and won the Presidency on. On May 7, 2015, Donald Trump tweeted: ``I wasthe first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to social security, Medicare and Medicaid.'' On April8, 2015, Mr.Trump said: ``Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security.'' That is not Bernie Sanderstalking; that is Donald Trump talking.       They want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it      onMedicaid and we can't do it. It is not fair to the people      that have been paying in for years.  That is not Bernie Sanders--Donald Trump, our soon-to-be  On March 29, 2016, Mr.Trump said:       You know, Paul [Ryan]--  Paul Ryan is the Republican Speaker of the House--     wants to knock out SocialSecurity, knock it down, way down.      He wants to knock Medicare way down and frankly . . . you're      going to lose the election ifyou're going to do that. I am      not going to cut it, and I am not going to raise ages and I      am not going to do all of the thingsthey want to do, but they      want to really cut it and they want to cut it very      substantially, the Republicans, and I am going todo that.''  What Mr.Trump said was exactly right. Here are the ``they.'' This is the day. They want to cut Social They wantto cut They want to cut Mr.Trump was right, and millions of people voted for him on the belief that hewould keep his word.  Well, it seems to me that Mr.Trump right now has to do one of two things. 1, if all that he was talking about wascampaign rhetoric, then what he is obliged to do now is to tell the American people: I was lying. Yes, I said that I would notsupport cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but I was lying. It was a campaign ruse. I just said what came to mymind to get votes. I have no intention of keeping my word. If that is what he believes, if that is what the case was, let himcome forward and say that. But if that is not what the case is, if he was sincere, then I would hope that tomorrow or maybetoday he could send out a tweet and tell his Republican colleagues to stop wasting their time and all of our time and for Mr.Trump to tell the American people that he will veto any proposal that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid, and that cuts What we are talking about right now--let us be clear: no debate. That is exactly what this goal is. That is what thisbudget proposal is. It is to move toward the voucherization and privatization of Medicare, to make massive cuts in Medicaid andthrow millions of people off health insurance.  So there is a lot of responsibility on Mr.Trump's shoulders, but I would hope that he could save us a whole lot of time bytelling the American people that he was sincere in what he said during the campaign, that he was not lying. If that is the case,we can end this discussion, get into the serious business of how we create a quality health care system guaranteeing health careto all people in a cost-effective way.

7707,topic-id,581,"I want to thank my colleague for her very thoughtful presentation talking about the implications of simplyrepealing  The assumption that many of my colleagues seem to start from is that before ObamaCare, the health care system was great inAmerica, that everybody had health care in a cost-effective way and then ObamaCare came along and all of these problems arose.  What the Senator from Michigan just told us--and I want people to remember it--8 years ago, if you were diagnosed with cancerand you walked into an insurance company, they would say: Why would we give you insurance? We will lose money on you. Yourcancer may recur.  You are a woman and you want maternity coverage? What do you think is going on? Why should we do that?  You are a family with a kid who is 21 years of age and you want his insurance on your policy? Well, you couldn't have it.  I think what the Senator from Michigan pointed out is not that anyone thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect--nobodythinks it doesn't need improvement. But to simply throw out all of the benefits, for 30 million people to be thrown off ofhealth insurance--during the budget hearings a couple of years ago that Senator Enzi chaired, I asked a question of mycolleagues when this idea came up, and I would ask it again to my good friend from What are the studies you have seenin terms of the number of people who will die when they lose their health insurance? How many thousands of people will diebecause they no longer have health insurance and they cannot go to the doctor and the hospital? The studies I have seen suggestthat many thousands of people will die. That is common sense. If you throw 30 million people off of health insurance, they aregoing to die. How do you go forward providing a death penalty to thousands of people without having any solution to it?  Further, I would add to the excellent points made by the Senator from Senator Enzi and the Senator from Texasbefore him talked about the impact of health care problems in rural areas. I come from a rural area. Michigan has large parts ofthe State that are rural. The Senators from rural areas on the Republican side have said they want to make sure theirconstituents in rural areas can see a doctor. That is certainly a modest proposal. Of course they should be able to see adoctor.  If that is the case, my Republican friends should understand what the Federation of American Hospitals and the AmericanHospital Association said about repealing the Affordable Care These are major hospital organizations. According to a veryrecent report, what they said is that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act will mean a reduction in payments to rural hospitalsof over $165 billion over a 10-year period. According to the hospital associations, rural hospitals will suffer an additionalloss of $289 billion from their inflation updates.  This is a report from the Federation of American Hospitals and the American Hospital Association, major health careinstitutions in They said in their report: ``This reversal of health coverage would represent an unprecedented publichealth crisis.'' Furthermore, they said: ``The magnitude of reductions would threaten hospitals' ability to serve patients.''  So when we talk about the needs of rural Americans, I would hope my colleagues listen to what the Federation of AmericanHospitals and the American Hospital Association have to say.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS31-3.txt,1010,MOTION TO PROCEED TO EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,4.0,February

7532,topic-id,1324,"Mr.President, as hearings for the President-elect's nominees get underway starting today, I want to reiterate that a fair and thorough vetting process is a top priority, not only for my caucus but for the American people.  Chief to achieving that is a fair hearing schedule and process. First, it means hearings that are sufficiently spaced out so Members who sit on multiple committees can actually attend all the hearings. It means only holding hearings after the full committee paperwork--OGE review, FBI background check, and a full divestment plan--has been received and Senators have adequate time to review the information. That means, if there are Senators with remaining questions that weren't covered in a first hearing, they can have the nominee come back for a second day.  Our caucus and much of America was alarmed and disappointed by the announcements of the hearing schedule this week, which did not meet these basic courtesies and best practices that have always been extended in the past. However, I am happy to say that after negotiating with my friend the majority leader and his respective committee chairs, we have been able to make some progress on a fair hearing process.  I appreciate the majority leader's openness and efforts to accommodate our caucus in the last few days. Originally there were six hearings scheduled for this Wednesday, all especially important Cabinet posts: State, Attorney General, Education, Transportation, Homeland Security, That was largely unprecedented. We have looked back in history and can only find one instance where there were that many hearings of important Cabinet members on one day like that.  After negotiations with the majority leader, we have moved things around so[[Page S183]]that there are now only three hearings scheduled for Wednesday: Secretary of State, Transportation, and the second day of the AG hearings. All of these nominees have their paperwork in. The nominee for Secretary of Education, who does not yet have a signed ethics agreement and whose paperwork is not close to complete, was moved. That hearing will take place next week, pending her paperwork being submitted with time for Senators to review.  It is still a busy week. It is a little too busy for my personal taste, but it is a good first step. I hope we can continue to negotiate in good faith, to sort out the schedule in a way that is acceptable to both of our caucuses.  I also want to make clear that this progress does not mean our caucus is any less intent on having the President-elect's nominees complete the standard ethics forms, questionnaires, and FBI background checks required of every nominee. To have all this information come in after the hearing is sort of like ``Alice in Wonderland''--it makes no sense and has things upside down. I am still concerned, for example, that we don't have a completed FBI background check for the nominee for Secretary of His hearing starts tomorrow. And today there are reports in the media that under Rex Tillerson's leadership, Exxon conducted business with Iran, potentially in violation of U.sanctions law. There are serious questions that need to be answered.  In this particular case, Mr.Tillerson should release all his tax returns and promise to answer any questions on the Iran dealings that members ask. This is too serious a subject to have questions ducked. It demands a completely open airing of all relevant information. Did Mr.Tillerson go around our Iran sanctions simply to line Exxon's pockets? That would be a very bad thing. The American people ought to know about it before the Senate has to vote to confirm. For Rex Tillerson to answer the questions, and particularly questions about Exxon setting up a separate subsidiary to get around our Iran sanctions, is what the Founding Fathers wanted us to do when they enumerated in the advise and consent process.  This is not a partisan game. We are not doing this for sport. These aren't obscure procedural complaints. This is standard process. As I reminded my friend the majority leader yesterday, this is the same exact process my counterpart demanded in 2009 when the shoe was on the other foot. Just as then-Minority Leader McConnell laid out in his 2009 letter to then-Majority Leader Reid, Democrats expect each nominee to have all the prerequisites, with time to review, before we move forward with the hearings. President Obama's nominees completed all of their paperwork in 2009 before the hearings. We expect nothing less from President-Elect Trump's nominees. Particularly, we expect the paperwork to be all in with time to review. Having the paperwork in at 7 a.m. and holding a hearing at 10 a.m. is unacceptable. We expect there will be adequate time for followup questions on a second day of hearings if Senators are unable to finish their questions.  Today my colleague the majority leader said: Well, most of the Cabinet nominees were in already when this letter came out. But the letter doesn't specify who. It includes Cabinet members, and there were future Cabinet members who would come forward. It is a good standard. We are all for it. We are asking our friends on the other side of the aisle to stick with it. What was good for them in 2009 is good for the country in 2017.  We are insistent on the process because it is the right thing to do; it is the American thing to do. We don't hide nominees and rush them through. They have huge power. If the President-elect and our Republican colleagues are as proud of the nominees as they state, then they should be happy to have them answer a lot of questions in a hearing that is not rushed. It is how we will ensure that Cabinet officials, who are imbued with an immense power in our government, are ethically and substantively qualified for these positions.  If there is any group of Cabinet nominees that cries out for this process, it is this group of nominees. This proposed Cabinet is unlike any other. It is wealthier than any other. It has complex webs of corporate connections--so many of the nominees--that pose huge potential conflict of interest problems. Frankly, it is the most hard-right Cabinet in its ideology. It is quite different from the way President-Elect Trump campaigned. The potential conflicts of interest for multimillionaires such as Rex Tillerson or Betsy DeVos or Steve Mnuchin are enormous.  As I said, the nominees have views far to the right of what the President campaigned on. The most glaring example is Representative His whole career has been focused on ending Medicare as we know it. My colleague the majority leader said the American people want us to move forward and give President-Elect Trump his nominees. If they knew that one of the nominees had been dedicated to basically getting rid of Medicare, would they want us to vote for him? I will bet not. It sure explains why they want to rush these nominees through.  They don't want all of these things brought to light, but that is the wrong thing to do. We are going to fight to get to the right thing to do. The American people have a right to know if they voted for a President who might be going back on one of his key campaign promises. They deserve nothing less than open and deliberate hearings going forward. Will Representative Price stick with what President-Elect Trump said--no cuts to Medicare, Medicaid--or will he pursue his lifelong dream of privatizing and limiting them? We shall see, but we need answers at hearings before we vote. The American people are entitled to it.  Once again, I thank the majority leader for dealing in good faith and trying to address our concerns. I hope for the sake of the national interests that our two parties can come together on an agreement for the remainder of the process, as we have for the process so far.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS182-3.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 428, RED RIVER GRADIENT BOUNDARY",2017.0,10.0,January
7547,topic-id,1185,"Mr.President, first I will speak on the Supreme Last Thursday, I announced my opposition to Judge Neil Gorsuch and endeavored to explain why, on the merits, I don't believe he deserves to be elevated to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme  I listen to my friend, the distinguished majority leader, each morning. Since the beginning of this Congress, he has chalked up every Democratic request or objection in this body to ``sour grapes,'' to some leftover resentment from the election. It is just not true, but he keeps trying. Now he is trying the same strategy with Judge He repeatedly cites a quote by a friend of the judge's who, of course, said ``there is no principled reason'' to oppose this nomination, so it must be politics, the majority leader concludes. I respectfully but wholeheartedly disagree with the majority leader on this point.  There are several principled reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  First, Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he would be an independent check on a President who has shown almost no restraint from Executive overreach. He asserted independence but could not point to a single thing in his record to guarantee it.  He refused to publicly condemn what the President did when he went after the three-judge panel on the Ninth He had a case before them, and the President said: If they don't decide my way, they will be guilty of terrorism. I have never seen anything like that in all my years of politics. Judge Gorsuch refused to publicly condemn. He said privately to different people that he was disheartened. When President Trump said: He didn't mean me, Judge Gorsuch shrugged his shoulders, going along with what the President said.  Second, he was unable to convince me that he would be a mainstream Justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology. His career, his early writings, and his judicial record suggest not a neutral legal mind but instead someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology. He was championed by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and has not shown 1 inch of difference between his views and theirs. I would ask my colleagues this question: Are all these groups who are spending dark, secret, undisclosed money to support his nomination doing so because they just want a Justice on the Court who will ``call balls and strikes''? I doubt it. Some here may agree with the Heritage Foundation, but they are not a mainstream organization. They are on the far right. That is their right to be. But their advocacy of Judge Gorsuch suggests he is not a ``balls and strikes'' guy.  Finally, Judge Gorsuch is someone who almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak and corporations over working That is what his record shows. Judge Gorsuch repeatedly sided with insurance companies that wanted to deny disability benefits to employees, and in employment discrimination cases, he sided with employers the great majority of the time.  He wrote--in dissent--that trucking company executives were right to fire truckdriver Alphonse Maddin for leaving his trailer in order to save his life. And just last week, we saw another example of how extreme Judge Gorsuch's views are when the Supreme Court unanimously rebuked his interpretation of the Individuals with Disabilities In the opinion of even Justice Thomas, the educational rights Judge Gorsuch would allow to disabled students under the law amount to no education at all.  Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to disabuse us of all of those objections was in the hearing process, but he declined to substantively answer question after question. Absent a real description of his judicial philosophy, all we have to go on is his record--a record that landed Judge Gorsuch on the lists of the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage President Trump, of course, selected Judge Gorsuch off those preapproved conservative lists, as he promised he would during his campaign.  To claim, as the majority leader does, that Judge Gorsuch is simply a neutral judge is belied by his history since his college days, his own judicial record, and the manner of his selection.  These are principled reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, even if people on the other side disagree with them. We need a Justice who will be an independent check on the We need someone who will consider fairly the plight of average citizens, not further tip the scales of justice in favor of already powerful corporations. Judge Gorsuch--his record and his performance in the hearing--did nothing to show me he could be that kind of  So when Republicans said that if Democrats won't support Judge Gorsuch, we won't support any Republican-nominated judge, that is simply not true. It may be hard for us to support anyone from a list culled by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, but we have several reasons to be concerned with Judge Gorsuch specifically.  For all the hand-wringing by my friends on the other side of the aisle that they cannot imagine Democrats voting against Judge Gorsuch, I would like to remind them that only three--three--of the current Senators on the Republican side voted for either of President Obama's confirmed nominees, and all of them went along with my friend the majority leader's unprecedented plan to refuse President Obama's third nominee, Judge Garland, even a hearing or a vote for nearly a year.  Which brings us back to the present day, where we Democrats have participated in a fair, transparent, and thorough process of advice and consent. Now that the time to decide whether to provide consent approaches, we take that responsibility seriously. A lifetime appointment on the highest Court of the land is not something to be taken lightly.  To participate in hearings and a thorough process--something we were denied--does not mean you have to be a rubberstamp. After a thorough review of Judge Gorsuch's record, many of my colleagues and I have concluded we cannot consent.[[Page S2019]]  If Judge Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, it will not be because Democrats are being obstructionists, it will be because he failed to convince 60 Senators that he belongs on the Supreme  My friend the majority leader made the decision to break 230 years of Senate precedent by holding this seat open for over a year. If the nominee cannot earn the support of 60 Senators, the answer is not to break precedent by fundamentally and permanently changing the rules and traditions of the Senate; the answer is to change the nominee. This idea that if Judge Gorsuch doesn't get 60 votes, the majority leader has to inexorably change the rules of the Senate--that idea is utter bunk.  It is the free choice of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pursue a change in rules if that is what they decide.

7471,topic-id,1100,"Mr.Speaker, it is a delight for me to join the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck) on a piece of legislation that actually has his name on it, he is responsible for, understands, and is prepared today to fully debate.  I would also like to thank the gentleman from Florida, a member of the Rules Committee, for not only coming down to offer his argument against the facts of the case as they reside today on this important piece of legislation, but I also want to acknowledge that I know the frustration.  I know there is a lot of frustration. There is a lot of frustration from our colleagues who have lost the House, the Senate, and the They are in the middle of what might be called wandering, as they have called it, in the darkness or in the doldrums of being deep in the minority.  With that said, there is an agenda that is being laid out before the American people. It happened, Mr.Speaker, directly as a result of what we call an election--an election where all these issues, or most of them that have been discussed by the gentleman, were fully debated not only in a theater near you, but directly in congressional contests, in senatorial contests and the debates for the President of the United  The facts of the case are really pretty simple. The Republican Party will be talking about all the issues that the gentleman brought up today right before our eyes. Probably on C-SPAN, trying to compete against us, is a hearing in the Energy and Commerce  The gentleman, Greg Walden, the chairman of the committee, over the weekend released the text of the chairman's mark, the ``bill'' of the Republican Party of how we are going to look at health care.  It is true that we have Chairman Devin Nunes of the Intelligence Committee looking at the issue that was[[Page H1614]]brought up of We have forthrightly, over the weekend, said: All right. We are being asked to look at this. Just so you know, media, American people, we are going to do that. We are going to do what you have asked because we believe it is the right thing to do: open hearings, open debate, acknowledgement of the issues, and a certainty that we will go look into it, and we are going to let you know what we find. That is really where we are.  This morning, at 8 a.m. in my office, I cohosted with the gentleman from Florida an opportunity for the American Bar We brought in, from across this country--I didn't bring them in; they came into my office from across the country--a number of well-established, thoughtful, and articulate people. We didn't ask: Are you Republican? We didn't ask: Are you Democrat? We said: You represent your organization, and we want to hear from you.  This is the kind of leadership that I believe not only myself but also the gentleman, Mr.Hastings, wants to be associated with. We want to be associated with listening to the American people, trying to be thoughtful about what we do and have equal participation.  The gentleman knows that at the Rules Committee yesterday we had a very thoughtful person representing the Republican The gentleman from Iowa (Mr.King) came up. We had Mr.Buck, who was able to come and talk about this issue today.  In fact, it might be an arcane issue to the American people, but it consumes a lot of time, and it has a deliberative effect on the outcome of important cases in Federal courts and State courts across the country. We feel like it is worthy of an afternoon, an afternoon at the Rules Committee, to fully vet the legislation and an afternoon here on the floor of the House of  But like any other good majority, we have a lot of other things going on, and we are looking at the Affordable Care Act, how it worked and how we might thoughtfully replace it. We are looking at the issues related to We are looking at the American Bar  Members of Congress are extremely busy, but, Mr.Speaker, I think, with great respect, we should give the author of the bill, Mr.Buck, his time to come and thoughtfully explain why we are doing what we are doing.  I am just a dadgum chairman of the committee. I just do the things that I hope are necessary to look at every single item and being fair--being fair in the ability that people have to come and bring their ideas and trying to be fair in trying to bring them down here.  So I want to thank the gentleman for acknowledging this body is busy. This body is engaged in, as we speak, a public, open debate about what direction health care should go.  What I would like to offer is my evaluation of where we are going to be. We are going to be at a point where we do not have to scare people about where we have been or why we are going to a place.  I am on what is known as As a Member of Congress, I am legally required to be on ObamaCare for health care. But, Mr.Speaker, it is twice as expensive as what I had before; and it is not working for me, it is not working for my family, and it is not working for a lot of people.  So we are trying to look at how we might carefully, thoughtfully, artfully work with the American people, so we put the bill up and let you see it. We don't have to pass it to find out what is in it. We are trying to read the bill and understand it first.  Mr.Speaker, it is not a pledge. It is a hope that every single Member of this body will understand what is in the bill before they can respectfully, whether somebody disagrees or agrees with it, explain the bill for what is correct.  What is correct about the bill is this: if you like your own doctor, you can keep your own doctor. If you like your own healthcare plan, even if it is ObamaCare, you can do that, too.  The Republican Party is open about what we believe. We are trying to be thoughtful with the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I believe, with the leadership that we have of Paul Ryan who has attempted to work through a difficult issue, the American people will understand why Republicans not only won the election, but why Republicans have better ideas in health care, too.

For them to presume that they know the score before they know the outcome is not the way the chairman of the committee looks at it. Mr.Walden looks at it that he is going to let the committee vote and come up with a bill, and there are significant changes that could happen one way or another. I think it would be a presumptuous viewpoint to say here is the bill and here is the score, take it or leave it.

7554,topic-id,1531,"Mr.President, I thank my colleagues in the Serving in this body for 20 years has been one of the great honors of my life. I remember coming up when I was running for the Senate and going to the Republican luncheon. They said: Well, you have a few minutes. You can say something, but don't talk very long because people don't want to hear a lot from you, frankly.  So I told them that I could think of no greater honor than to represent the people of Alabama in the greatest deliberative body in the history of the world. That is what I feel about this body. I want to say, I appreciate the full debate we have had. I want to thank those who, after it all, found sufficient confidence in me to cast their vote to confirm me as the next Attorney General of the United States of  I have to tell you, I fully understand the august responsibilities of that office. I served as United States attorney for 12 years and assistant United States attorney for a little over 2 years. During that time, the very idea of those great leaders in Washington leading those departments I served under make it almost impossible for me to conceive, I am that person and will have that opportunity and that responsibility.  So I understand the seriousness of it. I have an interest in law enforcement. I have an interest in the rule of law. So I want to thank those of you who supported me and had confidence in me. I want to thank President Donald He believes in the rule of law. He believes in protecting the American people from crime and violence. He believes in a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest, within bounds, and those are things that may from time to time come before the Office of Attorney  I look forward to lawfully and properly advancing those items and others that we as a body support, and the American people believe in.  The Attorney General--this is a law enforcement office first and foremost. People expect the Department defend us, defend us from terrorists, defend us from criminals, defend the country from fraudsters who raid the U.Treasury time and time again and too often are not being caught or held to account for it.  I believe that is a big responsibility of the U.Attorney General and the whole Department of As a former Federal prosecutor, I worked regularly, nights, weekends, and became personal friends with fabulous Federal investigative agents. They give their lives, place their lives on the line[[Page S964]]for us to promote public safety, to try to do the right thing for  Sometimes people think of them in terms of taking away our freedoms. That is not so. They are out there every day putting their lives on the line to advance our freedoms, to protect our liberties, to protect public safety, to stop terrorism that threatens our government.  So I feel strongly about that. I had the honor to lead some of the finest assistant United States attorneys in Our goal--well, before I became an assistant, I was told that Mobile had the best U.attorney's office in  So when I came back as U.attorney some 6 years later, I told them that was our goal. We were going to have the best United States attorney's office in What a great time we had. We had wonderful people. They worked nights and weekends to prepare their cases. We went before great Federal judges. It was a glorious time. It was really a special time.  I will never ever forget that. I was before the Judiciary committee in 1986, and Senator Kennedy--later my friend--spoke harshly about me. It was on the They would show his statement. He said I should resign my office. So a few minutes later I had a chance to say something. I said: Senator Kennedy, what you said breaks my heart. Nothing I have ever done have I been more proud of than serving as United States I still believe that. Nothing I have ever done am I more proud of than the work we did in that little office in Mobile, AL, representing the United States of  You go into court, you stand before the judge, and you say: The United States is ready. I represent the United States of America in a litigation. So this is a big deal. So I would say to you, friends and colleagues, that this is a special honor. I feel it in my bones. I hope and pray I can be worthy of the trust you have given me. I will do my best to do that.  Let me comment a minute on the heated debate we have had here in the Senate on my nomination and others. It was an intense election. There is no doubt about that. There have been strong feelings expressed during the election and throughout this confirmation process. Sometimes we have philosophical disagreements, just sincere disagreements about policy, what is right and what is wrong, what the law says, what it does not say.  I believe words ought to be given their fair and plain meaning. Words are not tools that can be manipulated to make it say what you want it to say. I believe words have objective meanings. So sometimes we have differences about that, but that is what elections are about. I have always liked the debate. I have always enjoyed participating in this great body, where we are free to speak and be able to advocate for the values that we have.  But I don't think we have such a classical disagreement that we can't get together. I have always tried to keep my disagreements from being personal. I have always tried to be courteous to my colleagues. Still, tension is built in the system. It is there. The plain fact is that our Nation does have room for Republicans and That is what freedom is all about. I am fairly firm, I have to say, in my convictions, but that does not mean that all of us have to agree on the same thing.  We need latitude in our relationships. So let's agree on what we can agree on, and I suggest that to my colleagues as I leave here, and take action where we can agree on things, but denigrating people whom you disagree with I think is not a healthy trend for our body.  After I had been here for a number of years, I had gotten along pretty well with Senator Kennedy on the Judiciary He asked me to be the lead sponsor with him on the significant, pretty controversial bill to eliminate prison rape. There were a number of honorable people who opposed it, some friends of mine. He said: I want to do this with you. People asked me: Did you ever have a reconciliation? Did he apologize?  He said: I want to do this bill with you. And I knew what that meant. I appreciated that. I said: I want to do this bill with you. And so we were able to pass that bill together. It was a moment of reconciliation that meant a lot to me. I think he appreciated it too. We later got involved in another major piece of legislation, just the two of us, that would have established a portable savings plan for young workers like the Federal thrift plan.  About that time, the financial crisis hit, and then he became ill and it never came to fruition. But reconciliation is important. We ought to do that in this body. We ought to try to fight for our values and not give an inch. You don't have to back down if you believe you are right, and you should not back down.  But there are ways that we can get along personally. I would say that would be my prayer for this body; that in the future maybe the intensity of the last few weeks would die down and maybe somehow we would get along better.  So, colleagues, I can't express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time. I could start calling all their names, but it would not be appropriate. I want to say again, I appreciate the President and his confidence in me, and by your vote tonight, I have been given a real challenge. I will do my best to be worthy of it. I look forward to working with each of you during that time and maybe make sure that we have a good open door at the Department of  My wife has picked up pretty quickly that we have a chef, and we can actually invite people for lunch or breakfast there. Maybe we can do that.  Finally, let me thank my family because without their support, I could not be here. It is great. My children have been so engaged in this.

7650,topic-id,778,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern), who sits on the Rules Committee, and Mr.Buck, who is handling, I think, his first rule as a member of the Rules Committee today. Mr.Buck is from Windsor, He is a second-term Member and is doing an awesome job not only on his homework duties of recognizing how important it is for Members to understand what we are talking about and why we are doing things, but also enunciation of rules that we are talking about that were promulgated by an administration.  Mr.Speaker, what we are really here today to talk about is there are some of those rules and regulations where perhaps you didn't go through the process that you should have or where there was really a determination made by the American people that rulemaking goes too far. That is why we are here today.  We are here today because there is a group of rules that were promulgated that don't work and that did not really see, in our opinion, the balance of what was going to be in it for the American people. So, in particular, we are here to talk about a Social Security rule that discriminates against individuals with disabilities by denying them their constitutional rights.  The gentleman, Mr.McGovern, spoke very clearly about a meeting that we had at the Rules I think that the witnesses that we had were very specific and that they questioned--including Mr.Buck, who was most active in his participation in the hearing--to work through the rule that is promulgated but doesn't make sense when you evaluate it. The administration chose to, I think, without due process, take away from a person based upon a disability that had nothing to do with their ability to effectively control a weapon, but based upon other criteria and to take away a person's Second Amendment rights.  We oppose that. That is one of the reasons why we are here today. This rule that we are going to take away wrongly discriminates against those receiving disability benefits and, I believe, falsely promulgates a stereotype against individuals with mental illness, calling them dangerous. There are people who do have mental illnesses, there are people who are struggling in life, and there are people who need help and seek help; but that is not a criteria for taking away a person's constitutional right.  We are joined in what we believe by the National Council on This is what they said in a letter that they sent that was dated January 24 of this year: ``There is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own, possess, or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a representative payee. . . . `'  So what happened is the rule by the administration linked together these characteristics that they think identify a person as being a risk so they take away their constitutional right. We couldn't really relate to anybody that had done this, but it simply sounded like a good idea, I am sure, to people, and so they did this.  Mr.Speaker, we are not trying to right all wrongs at the Rules Committee, but when you take away somebody's constitutional rights and take advantage of a person because of their disability, I don't think that is fair.  I am proud of what Mr.Buck is doing here. I am proud that we stood up on this issue, and I am pleased to be on the floor not only to support Mr.Buck,[[Page H835]]but people who also live in the congressional district that I represent in Dallas, I have received several calls from people. While I will not say their names, they live in Dallas, Texas; Garland, Texas; Wylie, Texas; and Rowlett, Texas; and they are worried about their ability to lose their constitutional rights simply because they have some help in managing their affairs but not related to a constitutional right of owning a weapon.  So I am pleased to do this. There is no grandstanding necessary. There is an understanding of some things that can be written properly and some things that can't, and I simply think they got it wrong, and that is what we are going to do here today. I thank the gentleman, Mr.Buck, for allowing me the chance to speak on this important issue.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I ask the gentleman from Colorado if he has additional speakers or is that the speaker we were waiting for?

7653,topic-id,895,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts not only, once again, for being here, but for responsibly standing up for his party and the things which they not only have a right to bring to the floor, but an opportunity for him to discuss those things as he chooses to justify the rules that we are going to not only discuss their merits, but to really ensure that the American people understand why we believe that these rules that were promulgated need to be overturned.  Mr.Speaker, the second joint resolution that was included in Mr.Buck's rule is a resolution that discusses the Securities and Exchange Commission related to what is called disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers.  My gosh, what does that mean? Well, we understood the previous administration is anti what they call Big They are after anybody that is in the oil business. You and I both understand that our country and the world is stronger because we don't freeze to death in the winter and we don't get too hot in the summer because we have available energy at a great price.  But it means that companies in the United States also go around the world to find other places where they may extract oil or resources related to energy, and the Securities and Exchange Commission published in the Federal Register, on July 27, 2016, a rule that would place American companies--and only American companies--that extract valuable resources--meaning energy--from other places in the world and that they would have to publicly disclose arrangements and deals that they make related to them buying these resources.  The Securities and Exchange Commission understands already the rules that are on American companies, including a rule that we know as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which means that an American company cannot go overseas and induce through bribing someone to do something. But now, in order to stop these companies--many of them large companies, many of them medium-sized companies, but their nexus is that they are energy companies--they are going to require in this rule that that company tell everybody, including competitors, what the deal might be that they got. So a private contract that might be between a country, a company, and an American company is now going to see the light of day.  Mr.Speaker, I think that is wrong. Fortunately, so does my party. We think that is wrong, because it unnecessarily puts U.companies at a competitive disadvantage to many state-owned competitors around the world who are competing, many times, for the same resources.  In other words, we just told them what the deal is--how much money, what the arrangement is, how it might be concluded--and that is a violation, in my opinion, of not only the power that the SEC has, but I think it is unwise. I think it is blatantly unwise that we would unearth contracts from the free enterprise system while, at the same time, knowing they have to follow the rules of engagement, meaning the rules under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, at the same time.  So, Mr.Speaker, what we are here to say is that we believe that these agencies are trying to harm America's opportunity to go and seek out good deals, better deals, and to find long-term contracts around the globe, wherever they might be, and that they have singled out energy companies, that they have gone out of their way in what was known as the Obama administration to single out energy companies because they don't like energy deals.  Mr.Speaker, what has happened as a result of not only this, but legislation that the Congress has done on December 18, 2015, is we changed the Federal law related to the export of U.energy. Before, there was a provision, some 40-year-old provision, that did not allow energy from the United States to be sold overseas. Once we did that, it completely turned the market upside down. So what might be deals then and deals now are in the best interest of consumers instead of what might be OPEC or a few other energy-rich countries.  We think that what this was done for was to punish those companies that can go find better deals by telling everybody what happened--but it was mostly done to punish--and it put us at a disadvantage.  We are here on the second part of this joint resolution to say that the rule that was promulgated on July 27, 2016, is bad for America, is bad for consumers, and most of all, it is bad for America to have rules and regulations that take away the power of a private contract.  We stand up and say: What are we going to do about it? We are going to go through the deliberate action that was taken not only at the White House, but was taken on the floor of the House of Representatives so that we have our say in the matter on rules and regulations.  Mr.Speaker, I would advise my colleague, Mr.Buck, that there is a person who heard this debate going on and has come to the floor. I don't know if he would choose to yield time to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Massie), but I have been told that Mr.Massie would like to help me along on some of my comments because of his excitement about what this rule does.

I was also honored to be able to have an office right across the street from the VA hospital that we just opened up last week, to be in proximity and to help our veterans.

Yes, he should have resigned, but he is just the tip of the iceberg. A glacier of Russian interference is plaguing our country right now.  In his resignation letter, General Flynn wrote: ``I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.''  I believe General I believe he did precisely what the President of the United States asked him to do. General Flynn is a military man. He is accustomed to the chain of command. He did not do anything that he was not asked to do. He was not a rogue agent, but had the complete knowledge and cooperation of his Commander in  We have all heard Donald Trump boast of how smart he is and how he calls his own shots. Why then should we believe that, when it comes to national security, he prefers to be kept in the dark? A President can't be both in charge and out of the loop.  The only way we can ever hope to know what happened is if there is a thorough investigation. I believe it should be an independent investigation, an independent commission. But if we are going to go down the route of having it be a congressional investigation, then it needs to be a comprehensive investigation and one that has the resources to do the job.  I am calling on Chairman Nunes of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to schedule hearings immediately.  We heard 14 hours of testimony from Secretary Clinton about her emails. I think we can agree that foreign infiltration of our government at the highest level is at least as important as using a private email server, especially, I might add, when President Trump and his team used unencrypted cell phones during their North Korea strategy session at Mar-a-Lago in a dining room with many other guests.  Today, an Active Duty, four-star general said publicly that ``our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil'' and that he hopes ``they sort it out soon, because we're a nation at war.''  He continues: ``As a commander, I'm concerned our government be as stable as possible.''  It is critical that Congress takes heed of this unprecedented public warning and act.  I am well aware this is a partisan institution. I also know that there have been times in our proud history in the United States Congress when Members have pushed partisanship aside in search of the truth. The Warren Commission, following the assassination of President Kennedy, is one example. The 9/11 Commission after the terrorist attacks in 2001 is another.  In the Senate, at least three Republicans have directly called for investigations into this matter and several more have acknowledged that these questions must be answered. I wonder, will one House Republican Member come forward and say we must investigate?  Colleagues, I urge you to think this through. Vladimir Putin ordered agents to meddle in our election. Did he do it out of love for Mr.Trump? I doubt it. More likely, he did it so he could do to a democracy what we and our allies did to communism, send it to the ash heap of history. If America's elections can be hacked, what chance is there for budding democracies to make it?  Don't believe me? Look at what Putin has done in just 3 weeks of this new administration. He had government agents poisoned. He sent a political rival to prison. He sent $12 million to Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right candidate for the President of His latest move was to launch a cruise missile that is in direct defiance of treaties.  Putin's Russia is playing chicken with President Trump, and what is our President's response? A tweet complaining about leaks within his administration and, according to the latest reports, pressuring the Prime Minister of Japan to forge closer relations with                              {time}  1015  President Trump's ``bromance'' is dangerous. It undermines our democracy, and it is destabilizing the globe.  What does Putin have on President Trump? What does President Trump owe Putin?  We will not know until we exercise U.Code section 6103. A vote yesterday in Ways and Means was a totally partisan vote. We deserve to know what his tax return shows us. We deserve the truth.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1188-2.txt,1890,1330,2017.0,15.0,February
7705,topic-id,2590,"Mr.President, first let me comment on what my friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, said. If my cargoes into a ditch, the first thing I don't do is dismantle the car. That doesn't help me get anywhere in terms oftransportation.  First of all, let me speak on process before talking about the substance of what we are really talking about and how itaffects people. We have a bill in front of us that creates a process for the majority to be able to unravel and repealessentially our whole health care system. You pull a thread and it goes through not only employer-based care, patientprotections, people who have insurance, Medicare, All of it begins to unravel. Interestingly, also in this bill, inthe text it adds $1 trillion to the deficit--$1 trillion to the deficit in the bill that our colleagues just voted to proceed topass.  We need to be very clear on this: If colleagues want to work with us to fix problems and improve health care, we can startthis afternoon. It is almost 3:30. By 4 o'clock we could put together a group of people. I am sure our distinguished Democraticleader on the Budget Committee would be happy to sit down and work together on ways to make health care reform better and makehealth care more affordable and make it more available to people. If that is what we want to do, count us in, but that is notwhat we are talking about here. We are talking about this crazy idea that no one in their real life would do.  It is like deciding you want a new house, so you tear down the old house. That is the easy part. Then your family ishomeless. Then you say: Well, gosh, you know, maybe I better have a plan to get a new house for my family and figure out a wayto pay for it, to be able to afford it.  Nobody would do that. Nobody would start by saying: We are going to rip apart the entire health care system and createchaos. We are going to undermine We are going to undermine We are going to take away patient protections foreverybody who has insurance through their employer, and then we will figure out later what we are going to do to replace it, ifanything.  I know there is a division on the Republican side. Certainly Members in the House don't think it should even be replaced atall.  It is interesting. We are talking about one-sixth of the economy that would be destabilized. There is no question that ifyou do a repeal and insurance companies don't know what is coming--I have talked to hospitals, and they don't know what iscoming--behavior will begin to change. Rates will begin to go up. Different decisions will be made because, as businesses, theywill not know how to plan. Their investors will not know how to plan.  There is no question about it. When you repeal without creating certainty in the marketplace, you begin a process thatresults in chaos.  We have an interesting example, one that I have been involved with for a lot of years, where we wanted to change just onepiece of the health care system, the reimbursement system for doctors.  I was in the House when they passed Medicare changes. We put in place a new policy. We were going to write a new policy toreimburse physicians for quality instead of quantity. It makes sense. It took 18 years to get agreement. We got agreement lastyear. It doesn't even take effect for 4 years.  Everybody here knows about this thing called the doc fix. It is an inside term--or SGR, which is even more insider. The truthis, we were trying to change just one thing and could not get agreement to do it for 18 years.  Anyone who thinks that there is going to be a repeal without an ACA extender going on has not looked at past processes.  What is most important, though, is what this means to real people. This[[Page S37]]really is about a plan of ripping apart thehealth care system. There is nothing in its place immediately so we don't even know what will be coming. This is going to makeAmerica sick again.  We are talking about a process and a plan that for real people is not a political game. It is not smoke and mirrors. Itshouldn't be about politics. It is about the moms and dads who go to bed at night and say: Please, God, don't let the kids getsick. Now, many of them--close to 30 million counting everybody with new coverage--don't have to say that. They can say adifferent kind of prayer because they can go see the doctor.  We know that when you unravel that system with nothing responsible in its place, we are talking about making America sickagain. We want affordable care, not chaos. This plan goes from affordable care to chaos. We talk about some parts of what wepassed in health reform, but there are a lot of things we don't emphasize that I think are important to recognize in thisdebate.  First of all, what we pass in terms of changes in quality care affects every single American with health insurance. A lot of people in my State are fortunate to have employer-based insurance. We have a lot of folks at thecollective bargaining table fighting every year to make sure they keep their insurance--150 million people across the country.All of them have benefited from the patient protections we put into health reform. When we take those away, then immediately theinsurance companies will be back in charge. If you get sick, you can get dropped. Right now they can't do that. If you are sickor if your child is sick, right now you can't be blocked from buying insurance. We call it a preexisting condition. But beforehealth reform, insurance companies were doing that every single day--a child with juvenile diabetes, someone with cancer orAlzheimer's disease.  I think about a very good friend of mine who just found out her grandson has leukemia. He is 2 years old. He is goingthrough treatment. We pray he is going to be able to get through it successfully. He is going to have a preexisting conditionfor the rest of his life. With this repeal, there is no guarantee he will ever be able to get insurance. On top of that, if hehas to have treatments that go on for some period of time, caps will be reinstituted on the amount of care you can get, theamount of treatment per year, dollar amount, or amount of visits you can get, and there is no guarantee that this little boywill be able to get the treatment he needs so that he can live a healthy, successful life going forward.  In talking with pediatric cancer doctors a couple of weeks ago, it was so amazing and gratifying to me to hear them talkabout children whose lives have been extended, whose quality of life has been extended because of the fact that they are able tofully treat these children and insurance companies can't put caps on how much they will pay or how many treatments. Now there isa whole other range of protections for everybody.  One of the fights I was proud to lead in the Finance Committee when we passed the ACA was to make sure that the basicinsurance package every company has to provide has to include maternity care. That seems like a no-brainer. People were shockedthat it didn't. Before we passed health reform, 70 percent of the insurance companies--the policies you buy in the private marketdidn't include maternity care. In fact, women were viewed as having a preexisting condition because they might get pregnant,might have a baby. That is not true anymore. Women are not rated differently than men, and maternity care is now availableregardless of the kind of insurance you have. That is a pretty good deal. Right now I have a son and a daughter with growingfamilies, and I can tell you that is a very big deal in my family.  There is a whole range of things. We all know about young people who are able to stay on their parents' insurance. They getout of college and they are wrestling with a huge debt, and one thing they don't have to worry about is whether they can stay ontheir parents' insurance until they can find a job. That goes away with repeal.  Something I care deeply about is mental health. We have all worked together on opioids and substance abuse treatment.Because of what we did in health care reform, insurance companies cannot discriminate if it is mental health or substance abusetreatment rather than physical health treatment. Prior to what we passed, they could charge much higher copays, higher premiums,but not anymore. So the whole body--above the neck as well as below the neck--is now being treated equally with our insurancereforms.  So there are a multitude of things--preventive health services with no copays, such as cancer screenings for mammograms andcontraception. I was talking to someone who said she thought it was so wonderful that her drugstore wasn't charging her forcopays anymore on her contraception. I said: Well, you know, that is actually the law. That was changed when we passed theAffordable Care  So there is a whole range of things that relate to reviewing premium increases, if you get removed from your insurance, youhave the right to appeal. There is a whole range of things. So that is under the first step. Everybody will feel it wheninsurance companies are back in charge and, through this vote and the subsequent actions, patient protections are repealed foreverybody.  Secondly, this includes cuts in Medicare and Through what we did in health reform, we closed the gap on the highcosts of prescription drugs. We called it the doughnut hole. That was in the process of being closed. If you have a lot ofmedicines and a lot of costs, you suddenly get to a point where there is a gap in coverage and you have to pay the full cost.That goes away and the doughnut hole comes back.  What we did added 12 years of solvency to the Medicare trust fund to keep it strong longer. That goes away. Wellness visitsfor seniors--every year they are able to go in and get a physical without a copay--that goes away. So Medicare is undermined.Then, unfortunately, when you add the incoming nominee as Secretary of Health and Human Services and couple that with theproposals that the Speaker has had and others that I am sure we are going to see to turn Medicare into a voucher--you go into theprivate market. Here is your voucher. Good luck. That is part of what the new regime is promoting, which only adds to this.  Eighty percent of Medicaid spending is seniors in nursing homes. And we know that the majority of those who--many who havegotten care, in addition to the exchanges, have been folks who have been working hard every single day in minimum wage jobs andwho couldn't afford or find insurance before. Now they are covered if their State or their Governor is willing to do that. Wehave a whole bunch of folks who are working hard every day at minimum wage who at least know they have access to health care anda doctor.  Interestingly, this helps our hospitals, whether they are rural hospitals upstate or up north in Michigan or whether theyare our great urban hospitals, safety net hospitals in Detroit and other areas, instead of people walking into the emergencyroom and not having insurance and having the cost put on everybody who does. Because of the Medicaid expansion, when a workingperson comes in with Medicaid, they are able to pay for their own care rather than having everybody else with insurance carrythe brunt of that, which is the way it was prior to that.  So there are Medicare and Medicaid cuts.  Next, we do know that altogether, counting Medicaid and people using the new exchanges, we have about 30 million people whowill be kicked off of their insurance, folks who, like anybody else, want to have health insurance for their families. Can wedesign that in a better way? I would love to work with you on that. I am not going to kick them off first. I don't want to say:We are going to rip your insurance away. We are going to rip the small businesses I have talked to--rip their insurance away. Andthen, by the way, don't worry, further down the road we will figure out something else. We don't know what it is, we don't knowwhat it will cost, but trust me.  I wouldn't be trusting that would happen if I were counting on that for my insurance.[[Page S38]]  The fourth item is that there is no question that costs will go up by destabilizing the marketplace. We know the cost ofprescription drugs will go up as a result of taking away the extra help for prescription drugs. There is no question that costsare going to go up for everybody else who has insurance.  When we look at this, I don't know how anybody looking at this outside of a political lens or a rigid ideological lens couldsay this makes any sense. It doesn't make any sense.  We have a President-elect who is coming in who said that he would not do anything to hurt Medicare or Medicaid or Yet the first thing on the floor definitely undermines Medicare and We have a President-elect who said hewants to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Yet, by undermining Medicare prescription drug coverage, those prices aregoing to go up. People who have the most medical needs and need the most medicine are going to see their costs go up.  What would be better would be if the new incoming HHS Secretary would be given the ability to negotiate through Medicare forprescription drugs--something we have all fought for, for a long time. Let's allow drug reimportation. Our leader on thebudget--and I have as well--put seniors on buses in the past to demonstrate the differences in cost across the bridge betweenWindsor and Detroit, the cost of the same drug, with the very same safety provisions. That would bring down costs. Taking awayMedicare coverage and increasing the gap in coverage is exactly the wrong thing to be doing if, in fact, the incoming Presidentreally means it when he says he wants to bring down drug prices.  So there are a number of things we care deeply about on health care. As someone who has worked on this for years--in fact, itwas health care and health policy that first got me into politics, leading an effort to save a nursing home in my community. Icare deeply about this. I am one of the folks way down deep in the weeds on this. But we don't improve a health system byripping it out by its roots, by undermining the whole system without figuring out what comes next. That only happens if youreally don't care what comes next because if you care, that is not a responsible position.  So, Mr.President, and my colleagues, I feel very strongly that with everything we know that has been made available tostrengthen quality, to give people back their own decisionmaking instead of the insurance companies on basics like providingcare for themselves and their families, the strengthening of Medicare and Medicaid, the coverage that has been made available,we know there is a way to work together to make things better, and this is not it.

I would like to thank the gentleman from Ohio, first of all, as an incredibly important Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, a doctor himself and, as important, a colonel in the United States Army and the United States Army An incredible insight into the very issues we are addressing and, I think, bringing this bill right now, we had a very good debate on fixing the VA, moving them in the right direction. And this piece of legislation is incredibly spot-on about another piece of that accountability.  Wenstrup's bill will help the VA better understand its staffing shortages, and I think this is important. We all say 45,000 openings or whatever; it is important for us to know, do we need to hire all 45,000 of those; which ones are critical; which ones can be done faster. So that piece is common sense.  It develops an executive management fellowship program that will allow the VA to send its leaders to the private sector to learn best practices and vice versa; again, incredibly smart, welcome change.  It will allow the VA to develop technical advancements, so employees who are in a specific field can advance in title and salary, without moving to a management role.  Quality hiring, training, and retention starts with a good HR department. This legislation will provide critical research into best HR practice and then provide the training to VA HR managers. These provisions, along with other hiring authorities, will help the VA get the right people in the door.  Currently, as the gentleman said, the process is slow, cumbersome, and, quite honestly, I think it just burns people out before they get there. And these are really dedicated folks who want to serve.  I have a gentleman I have become acquainted with who is a nationally renowned cardiac surgeon who left a very lucrative private practice to go to the VA after his son was wounded in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and chose to do his part by going back into the VA system.  He mentioned how cumbersome it was. He mentioned some of the bureaucratic troubles that he had, and all he wanted to do was bring an incredible skill set to serve those who served us; and Mr.Wenstrup's bill does exactly that.  I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and ask that consideration in support of the amendments be brought forward, be considered.

7664,topic-id,1823,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my bill, H.1367, to improve the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain employees.  VA's mission of honoring and serving our Nation's veterans is second to none in the Federal Government, and a high-quality, high-performing workforce is key to VA's ability to successfully execute on that mission.  H.1367 contains a number of provisions that would strengthen VA's ability to identify staffing shortages, recruit employees to fill vacant positions, quickly onboard new hires, and retain high-performing workers across the country. It also contains provisions that would improve leadership and accountability throughout VA and increase the number of veterans in the Federal workforce.  To assist VA in identifying and addressing local staffing deficiencies, this bill would modify the annual determination of staffing shortages to include five clinical occupations and five nonclinical occupations for each VA medical center. Staffing needs can vary significantly from facility to facility, even within the same State, and create a variety of delays, backlogs, and other challenges for veterans.  This provision would allow VA to use this existing reporting tool, which dates back to the 2014 Choice Act, to target a total of 10 occupations at each VA medical center and use VA's existing direct hire authority to expeditiously address shortages for those occupations.  To increase leadership development opportunities for emerging leaders and encourage the dissemination of best practices between and among VA and private sector, the bill would establish an executive management program to allow eligible VA and private sector employees the opportunity to take 1-year fellowship positions in either comparable private sector entities or VA, respectively. This idea was brought to us by a veteran participating in the joint Veterans of Foreign Wars-Student Veterans of America legislative fellowship program and would mirror a successful fellowship model used by the White House and the State  To increase accountability for senior VA decisionmakers, the bill would require annual performance plans for VA political appointees, similar to the annual performance plans that are required for Senior Executive Service employees.                              {time}  1815  Like SES employees, political appointees perform at the very highest levels and play critical roles in setting and achieving high profile policies and priorities. It is only appropriate that they too be held accountable for their performance.  To incentivize the hiring of veterans across the Federal Government, the bill would change the service requirement for reservists and guardsmen to be eligible for veterans' preference from 180 days of consecutive Active-Duty service to 180 days of cumulative Active-Duty service, and expand those considered preference eligible to include all retired servicemembers.  Veterans gain a variety of skills during their time in uniform and are often[[Page H2137]]uniquely suited to Federal employment. In recognition of this, some form of veterans' preference has been in place since the Civil By modernizing this important benefit today, we can bring needed skill sets to the Federal workforce and promote employment opportunities for veterans, a win-win if there ever was one.  To encourage former VA employees who left VA service to gain relevant education or experience and then return to the VA, the bill would allow the VA to noncompetitively reappoint a former employee to a position not more than 1 grade higher than their former position.  I believe we must do everything possible to encourage former employees to come back and work at the VA and reward them for furthering themselves and using their new skills to benefit veterans.  In order to be eligible for reappointment under this authority, the former employee must have voluntarily, within the prior 2 years, maintained a satisfactory performance record while at the VA, and retained any necessary licensures or credentials.  To assist the VA in identifying and prioritizing vacancies, the bill would require the VA to establish a recruiting database listing each vacant position that the VA determines is critical to the VA's mission, is difficult to fill, or both.  Also, the bill would authorize and encourage the VA to track qualified applicants for vacant positions and use the recruiting database and the qualified applicant pool to quickly fill vacancies that have gone unfilled for a prolonged time.  To ensure the VA human resources professionals have a thorough understanding of the VA's unique hiring authorities, the bill would require Veterans Health Administration HR employees to receive regular, ongoing training.  The VA healthcare system benefits from direct hiring authorities for clinical personnel under title 38, United States However, these hiring authorities are unique to the VA and can be complex and difficult for HR employees to understand and work with, which increases the likelihood that those authorities go underused and HR professionals experience burnout.  This provision would support those professionals in their important work while ensuring that veterans benefit as much as possible from the special hiring authorities that Congress has granted the VA in statute.  To encourage highly skilled employees wishing to advance in their career at the VA without taking on a management role, this bill would require the VA to establish a promotional track for technical experts that does not require transition to a managerial position. This is a commonsense provision that would increase the VA's ability to retain employees in highly technical positions who want to remain at the VA and continue moving forward in their careers, but are either uninterested in or ill-suited to becoming a manager.  To increase the understanding of the VA's succession planning efforts, the bill would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on succession planning at each VA medical facility, as well as within the Veterans Benefits Administration and the National Cemetery  Earlier this week, the VA confirmed that 80 percent of current Veterans Integrated Service Network directors and 25 percent of current VA Medical Center directors are eligible to retire. Last year, the VA testified that it can take more than 6 months and multiple reannouncements to fill these important positions in both rural and major metropolitan areas.  Effective succession planning is critical to ensuring stable leadership and to identifying and developing emerging leaders who are ready, willing, and able to step up when existing directors or other managers retire or depart. I look forward to reviewing the results of GAO's work to see what further improvements can be made in this area.  To improve recruitment and retention of younger employees, the bill would require the VA to allow for excepted service appointments leading to conversion to career or career-conditional employment for students and recent graduates.  VA's existing workforce is aging and, as I mentioned just a moment ago, increasingly retirement-eligible. Unfortunately, the VA has historically performed poorly in comparison to other Federal agencies when it comes to hiring younger employees, which could put the VA's future at risk. I am hopeful that this provision will increase the VA's ability to build a pipeline of young talent.  Finally, to increase the VA's understanding of why departing employees choose to leave the VA and, in turn, how the VA could improve in order to retain other employees, this bill would require the VA to develop and deploy a standardized, anonymous exit survey process. The VA has an existing survey process but it is underutilized, with just 30 percent of all clinical employees completing it prior to their departure over the last 5 years, according to a GAO report issued last year.  Factors that contribute to employees voluntarily leaving VA service cannot be addressed unless they are identified, and this provision would help us do that.  In conclusion, Mr.Chairman, the future of the VA, our Nation's second largest bureaucracy, depends on the VA's ability to effectively and efficiently recruit and retain highly qualified and motivated employees in towns and cities across this country. In an increasingly competitive market with an increasingly retirement-eligible workforce, the stakes are simply too high for the VA to continue to struggle to hire the employees it needs.  While more remains to be done to simplify and shorten the VA's hiring process and strengthen the VA's ability to bring the very best professionals onboard to serve our veterans, H.1367 is the first step to ensuring a sufficient VA workforce is available to veterans for generations to come.  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

7660,topic-id,1879,"Mr.President, in my ``Time to Wake Up'' climate speech--this is 154--I sometimes feel as if I am out here banging hopelessly against a tightly locked, barred, and soundproofed door. I make them anyway because, at a minimum, I want history to know what happened here when people look back and ask what the hell went wrong with American democracy. But I do admit that it can sometimes be discouraging.  However, last week something important happened. A public servant won a victory against a massive special interest. A court in Massachusetts allowed the attorney general of that Commonwealth to obtain files and records from the ExxonMobil corporation about its climate denial enterprise.  That is great news, and it is an important event. There is virtually universal scientific consensus--and even alarm--about climate and oceanic changes caused by burning the fossil fuel industry's products. In the face of that concern, the fossil fuel industry has gone to the mattresses to defend its business model. It is defending what the International Monetary Fund has described as a $700 billion--billion with a ``b''--annual subsidy just in the United  To defend a prize of that magnitude, the industry has set up an array of front groups to obscure its hand and to[[Page S332]]propagate fake science designed to raise doubts about the real thing. With that fake science, they dupe the public and provide talking points for their political operatives. The front groups are a tentacled Hydra named after everyone from Cato to Madison, Jefferson, and Franklin, to George The resemblances between this fossil fuel climate denial operation and the tobacco fraud scheme are profound, and these resemblances are noted often, including by the lawyer who won the tobacco case. Yes, the Department of Justice won that case.  At the same time, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of the political weaponry handed to them by five Republican appointees on the Supreme This industry has used the unprecedented political power bestowed on mighty special interests by the Citizens United decision to extirpate--root out--any Republican support for climate action. When I got here, there was plenty of Republican support for climate action, but after Citizens United that changed. They have seized that party like a hostile political takeover and turned the Republican Party into the fossil fuel industry's political arm. It turns out that you can do this on the cheap, compared to losing a subsidy of $700 billion a year.  This whole scheme reeks of mischief and self-interest, but in political forums the industry is such a powerful behemoth that it can block proper hearings, spout calculated misinformation, cloud up the truth, lobby to its heart's content, refuse to answer questions, pile up the spin doctors and front groups, buy and rent politicians, and threaten to end careers of anyone who crosses them--and they do. They made an example of Representative Bob Inglis and bragged of the political peril--their words--that would result to those who crossed them. That is how they play in the political branches. Truth doesn't matter to them. Truth is their adversary.  But you cannot play that way in court. That is why last week's victory was important. Court is different. In court you have to speak truthfully. Your lawyers can be sanctioned for lying in court. In court, your testimony is under oath, and you can be cross-examined. In court, evidence can be demanded and must be produced. In court, you cannot buy a judge's good will or bully a jury into compliance. Tampering with the jury is a crime. Judges cannot meet secretly with one side. No money can change hands, and biased judges must be recused.  Sir William Blackstone was the best-known jurist in England and America at the time of the Trial by jury, he said, ``preserves in the hands of the people that share which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.''  No wonder powerful and wealthy ExxonMobil wants no part of that. This industry has gotten used to saying things with no accountability, dodging the truth, hiding the evidence, and using the massive weight of their political might to see to it that Congress has just the right bias wherever fossil fuel interests are a concern.  This Massachusetts ruling is a chink of light--and a welcome one--as darkness falls over an executive administration stuffed with nominees from the climate denial fringe, wrapped tight in the political tentacles of fossil fuel interests.  It makes the fossil fuel folks crazy to be called into court and to have to stand annoyingly equal before the law when they are used to being the big behemoth, able to tell everyone what to do or pay them or threaten them to do what industry wants. That is why they launched legislative subpoenas at attorneys general and what even Texas newspapers have called out as unseemly abuse of government power.  That is why they rush to the oil patch for judges who will interfere in investigations by attorneys general, even suggesting that attorneys general should not pursue cases against corporations whom they believe are responsible for misconduct because believing that is prejudicial.  Think of that. That is why the industry PR machine creates and propagates magical theories about the industry's First Amendment rights, when it is black letter law--admitted even by Senator Sessions in his Judiciary Committee hearing--that the First Amendment ends where fraud begins. Fraudulent speech, including fraudulent corporate speech, is not protected by the First It is not now, and it never has been.  To clarify this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a June 2016 Washington Post op-ed by Yale Law School dean Robert Post titled ``Exxon-Mobil is abusing the first amendment.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 2016]               Exxon-Mobil Is Abusing the First Amendment                            (By Robert Post)       Global warming is perhaps the single most significant      threat facing the future of humanity on this planet. It is      likely to wreak havoc on the economy, including, most      especially, on the stocks of companies that sell hydrocarbon      energy products. If large oil companies have deliberately      misinformed investors about their knowledge of global      warming, they may have committed serious commercial fraud.       A potentially analogous instance of fraud occurred when      tobacco companies were found to have deliberately misled      their customers about the dangers of smoking. The safety of      nicotine was at the time fiercely debated, just as the threat      of global warming is now vigorously contested. Because      tobacco companies were found to have known about the risks of      smoking, even as they sought to convince their customers      otherwise, they were held liable for fraud. Despite the      efforts of tobacco companies to invoke First Amendment      protections for their contributions to public debate, the      Court of Appeals for the D.Circuit found: ``Of course it      is well settled that the First Amendment does not protect      fraud.''       The point is a simple one. If large corporations were free      to mislead deliberately the consuming public, we would live      in a jungle rather than in an orderly and stable market.       ExxonMobil and its supporters are now eliding the essential      difference between fraud and public debate. Raising the      revered flag of the First Amendment, they loudly object to      investigations recently announced by attorneys general of      several states into whether ExxonMobil has publicly      misrepresented what it knew about global warming.       The National Review has accused the attorneys general of      ``trampling the First Amendment.'' Post columnist George      Will has written that the investigations illustrate the      ``authoritarianism'' implicit in progressivism, which seeks      ``to criminalize debate about science.'' And Hans von      Spakovsky, speaking for the Heritage Foundation, compared the      attorneys general to the Spanish       Despite their vitriol, these denunciations are wide of the      mark. If your pharmacist sells you patent medicine on the      basis of his ``scientific theory'' that it will cure your      cancer, the government does not act like the Spanish      Inquisition when it holds the pharmacist accountable for      fraud.       The obvious point, which remarkably bears repeating, is      that there are circumstances when scientific theories must      remain open and subject to challenge, and there are      circumstances when the government must act to protect the      integrity of the market, even if it requires determining the      truth or falsity of those theories. Public debate must be      protected, but fraud must also be suppressed. Fraud is      especially egregious because it is committed when a seller      does not himself believe the hokum he foists on an unwitting      public.       One would think conservative intellectuals would be the      first to recognize the necessity of prohibiting fraud so as      to ensure the integrity of otherwise free markets.      Prohibitions on fraud go back to Roman times; no sane market      could exist without them.       It may be that after investigation the attorneys general do      not find evidence that ExxonMobil has committed fraud. I do      not prejudge the question. The investigation is now entering      its discovery phase, which means it is gathering evidence to      determine whether fraud has actually been committed.       Nevertheless, ExxonMobil and its defenders are already      objecting to the subpoena by the attorneys general, on the      grounds that it ``amounts to an impermissible content-based      restriction on speech'' because its effect is to ``deter      ExxonMobil from participating in the public debate over      climate change now and in the future.'' It is hard to      exaggerate the brazen audacity of this argument.       If ExxonMobil has committed fraud, its speech would not      merit First Amendment protection. But the company      nevertheless invokes the First Amendment to suppress a      subpoena designed to produce the information necessary to      determine whether ExxonMobil has committed fraud. It thus      seeks to foreclose the very process by which our legal system      acquires the evidence necessary to determine whether fraud      has been committed. In effect, the company seeks to use the      First Amendment to prevent any informed lawsuit for fraud.       But if the First Amendment does not prevent lawsuits for      fraud, it does not prevent subpoenas designed to provide      evidence necessary to establish fraud. That is why when a      libel plaintiff sought to inquire into the editorial      processes of CBS News and CBS[[Page S333]]     raised First Amendment objections analogous to those of      ExxonMobil, the Supreme Court in the 1979 case Herbert v.      Lando unequivocally held that the Constitution does not      preclude ordinary discovery of information relevant to a      lawsuit, even with respect to a defendant news organization.       The attorneys general are not private plaintiffs. They      represent governments, and the Supreme Court has always and      rightfully been extremely reluctant to question the good      faith of prosecutors when they seek to acquire information      necessary to pursue their official obligations. If every      prosecutorial request for information could be transformed      into a constitutional attack on a defendant's point of view,      law enforcement in this country would grind to a halt.      Imagine the consequences in prosecutions against terrorists,      who explicitly seek to advance a political ideology.       It is grossly irresponsible to invoke the First Amendment      in such contexts. But we are witnessing an increasing      tendency to use the First Amendment to unravel ordinary      business regulations. This is heartbreaking at a time when we      need a strong First Amendment for more important democratic      purposes than using a constitutional noose to strangle basic      economic regulation.

7661,topic-id,296,"Mr.President, it makes this industry crazy to be in court and to have to tell the truth, so they will fight desperately on. The $700 billion a year in subsidies makes it profitable to ``lawyer up'' by the boatload for this fight and to litigate to their damndest. So this is not over, but this may be the moment when the truth finally found a path around the ramparts of our well-kept congressional indifference and began to find its way into the daylight.  That is one of the reasons the Founding Fathers gave us independent courts and juries. ``Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty,'' wrote John Independent courts and trial by jury were a big deal to the founding generation. The Founding Fathers had a keen sense of history and of politics and of the mischief of conniving men. They were deeply concerned about corruption--corruption of the body politic by interests and factions.  They knew the Bible and had read Isaiah's warning of how ``the faithful city has become a whore,'' with ``princes'' that are ``companions of thieves.'' They knew about abusive power. They could envision an interest become so powerful as to overwhelm the executive and legislative branches of government and bend those branches to its will. They could envision a special interest so powerful that it could buy its own presses and confuse or beguile the public with propaganda and nonsense.

7715,topic-id,1835,"Mr.President, I want to comment and say a few words about the use of the budget reconciliation process tofacilitate an effort to repeal but not replace ObamaCare, the Affordable Care I serve on the Budget During thecourse of multiple hearings during the previous year before the election, we heard the most adamant stories from the Republicanside about how dire our Nation's debt situation was, how dire our Nation's deficit was.  Member after Member on the Republican side spoke as if the end of the Republic was at hand. Yet the policies from the Bushadministration that kept driving that debt and that deficit they protect. They blamed President Obama for the effect of Bushpolicies that took place during President Obama's years, while defending those Bush policies the President had actually tried tocorrect. In many respects, their concern about the budget was a little ironic since they were defending the Bush policies thatcreated this debt and deficit explosion in the first place.  Nevertheless, be that as it may, you had this phalanx of Republican Senators in a state of very high animation about ourdebt and deficit. You would think that in this Congress, with control both over the House and the Senate and a RepublicanPresident-elect looming, they might use the budget reconciliation process to do something about the debt and the deficit.  After all, there was a lot of big talk last year, and here is the budget reconciliation process. As we see, it is not beingused to do anything about the debt or the deficit, it is being used to open an effort to repeal but not replace Theproblem is, when you do that, you do some pretty bad things to the debt and to the deficit.  Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, Medicare officials projected out-year costs for Medicare in 10-year increments. After the experience of the Affordable Care Act, they went back and they redid those projections,and they dropped the cost of Medicare dramatically. Those outyear costs, dramatically reduced, are an important, valuable steptoward lower debt, balanced budgets, and less of a national annual deficit. Repealing ObamaCare will undo that.  It was pretty clear from Budget Committee hearings that that reduction in anticipated Medicare costs in the outyears wasrelated to the work that had been done in the Affordable Care Act as well as the changes in experience that we are seeing. Thatis one budget buster which shows that this reconciliation effort is going in the wrong direction.  In Rhode Island, I watched this issue pretty closely because I want Rhode Island to be a leader in delivery system reform. Iwant ours to be one of the most efficient health care systems in the country, and I worked very hard over many years to put thepieces in place in Rhode Island to help make that come to pass. So I talked to people like Kurose, who runs one of ourlargest primary care practices, and Puerini, who runs another very big Rhode Island primary care practice, and I saw thatboth of them had taken advantage of the Affordable Care Act to make themselves accountable care organizations, ACOs, and theyhave used the powers and they have used the shared savings under those programs to change the way they deliver medicine.  What they show is that their price, their annual cost of service per patient, is actually going down. They are deliveringcare more efficiently and they are getting to illnesses earlier. They are not just churning the wheel of bill and pay, bill andpay, bill and pay; they are actually managing their patients' health. We hit this wonderful sweet spot where the patients arehealthier and the patients are way happier because they are getting better service, and the cost per patient in these practicesis coming down. So if that is taken away, we reverse that effect. It is plausible to think that those costs will start goingback up again. Why would we want to undo a method that has helped local practices improve the quality of care, reduce the costof care, and serve their patients better? The ACO program is part of the Affordable Care  The last thing is that around here, we try to defend One of the achievements of the Affordable Care Act was thatit extended the solvency of Medicare out to 2028. Undo this bill and there will be a direct hit on Medicare's solvency. It willcome roaring back.  So when you put what the Republican Senators on the Budget Committee said with such vehemence and alarm about the debt andthe deficit beside the use to which they have put the reconciliation process, which was designed to be used to reduce the debtand the deficit, and you look at how[[Page S44]]that actually plays out through the health care system--increasing the costs of whatwould have been accountable care organizations, if that gets undone; lifting back up, presumably, Medicare costs that in theoutyears were reduced because of this; and shrinking the time that Medicare stands as solvent--if that is not a hit on Medicare,I don't know what is.  The other piece in this process that bears on this is that during the period that these very dramatic concerns were beingexpressed about the debt and the deficit, the same party that was enunciating those concerns and those threats to our Americansociety and solvency was defending all of the loopholes in the Tax We tried and tried to find a loophole that ourRepublican friends would be willing to let go of, and we couldn't find a single one that I recall. Even President Trump isinterested in trying to get rid of the carried interest loophole that lets hedge fund billionaires pay lower tax rates thanbrick masons, but could we get an agreement on that from our colleagues on the other side? They wouldn't touch it.  I hope that as we go forward, we can find a way to bring tax expenditures lined up with appropriated expenditures under thepurview of the committee, but so far we have been unable to do that despite repeated bipartisan testimony that a tax expenditureis just the same as an appropriated expenditure in so far as it affects the debt and deficit--no difference--bipartisan testimony,clear on the record. The difference is that behind a great many of these lucrative tax loopholes that are baked into the TaxCode and that survive year after year after year is a special interest, whether it is somebody trying to depreciate theirprivate jet more rapidly than an airline can depreciate passenger aircraft, whether it is the carried interest loophole thatputs, very likely, the billionaire getting out of his limousine in front of his New York apartment in a lower tax rate than theguy holding the umbrella over his head, the doorman. How fair is that? But that is the status of the tax law. We couldn't getanybody to budge on that because there are obviously big, powerful interests who don't want to see that messed with. Why shouldthey pay taxes like ordinary people when they are superwealthy immortals who can buy themselves politicians?  So the ironies of the party that declaimed about debt and deficit with such vehemence through so many hearings, with so muchblame on President Obama even though it was carried-forward Bush policies they were defending that were driving so much of thatdebt--to have that group of people now come and use the reconciliation process designed and intended to address the debt and thedeficit instead to try to repeal but not replace ObamaCare in ways that I think can be very fairly projected to raise Medicarecosts, reduce Medicare solvency, and undo a good deal of the savings that doctors and taxpayers have shared from hard-workingpractices like Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians and Coastal Medical in Rhode Island, which have relied on the ACO provisionsin the Affordable Care Act to get those savings--who wants to undo that? It makes no sense, and least of all, it makes no budgetsense because those outyear health care costs will come home into the budget in those outyears. Of course, you compound thatwith the fact that no tax loophole is to be touched. No tax loophole can be addressed. No revenue can be generated by closingthe carried interest loophole, closing the private jet deduction, closing the tax benefits for the fossil fuel industry, whichis making more money than any industry has in history and hardly needs the support of the poor American taxpayer. But, no, bigspecial interests have big tax breaks, and they are going to be protected at all costs. That is really where we are on this.  I understand we used reconciliation to move It did, in fact, do the job of reducing the deficit, I believe.Undoing it goes in the opposite direction, but there is a certain ``what is good for the goose is good for the gander''equivalence about using that to undo what we did. I get that. But if we are really serious about addressing the debt anddeficit, then we shouldn't be using the reconciliation process, which is designed to reduce them both, to attack a health careprogram whose effect has been to reduce them both. That is where we stand right now.  In the months ahead, I hope we will be able to look at tax expenditures. More money goes out the back door through taxexpenditures than gets spent on some of our biggest programs. It is a huge loophole, and within it are a lot of veryunattractive special interest special provisions--loopholes in the worst sense of the word. We don't want to touch them becausenobody dares to touch the special interests behind them.  So that is where we are. I hope we can make real progress on the debt and the deficit and stop defending private jetreductions, stop defending fossil fuel subsidies, stop defending billionaire special tax breaks, and actually put the debt andthe deficit that America faces first rather than having conversations about that being window dressing until you get aRepublican President, and then you go completely haywire, using the reconciliation process to undo health care laws, raiseMedicare costs, and undo the ACO program that has been so effective in my  I see the junior Senator from Utah is presiding, and I know that Utah and Intermountain have some of the best health carework being done on delivery system reform, and it would surprise me very much if the leaders at Intermountain in Utah wereexcited about undoing the delivery system reform provisions of The Innovation Center at the Centers for MedicareServices, the ACO provisions, the provisions for shared savings between doctors and the taxpayer when savings accrue because ofbetter practices, the changes toward better models of payment--I would be very surprised if they were very enthusiastic aboutundoing those.  But, as I said, this is where we are, and I will close my remarks, and I hope that soon, once this exercise is over, we canactually get serious about closing loopholes and reducing the debt and reducing the deficit--the nominal cause of the Republicanson the Budget  I yield the floor.

7691,topic-id,710,"Mr.President, today I, along with my colleagues Congressmen Chaffetz from Utah and Conyers from Michigan, am introducing the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act, a bill that protects Americans from seeing their phones and other devices turned into location trackers without so much as a warrant or a warning. While law enforcement agencies can and have obtained, and should obtain, probable cause search warrants from a neutral judge authorizing them to track the location of Americans, in many other cases, government agencies obtain sensitive location information without a warrant. My colleagues, Mr.Chaffetz and Conyers, and I intend to fix that.  This is a situation where government agencies' use of new technology has gotten ahead of the laws in ways that would surprise many Federal, State, and local agencies routinely track Americans' locations through a variety of methods, most of the time without people knowing they are being tracked. Some tracking demands go directly from the government to phone companies. In the first 6 months of 2016, law enforcement agencies submitted at least 86,000 demands to telephone companies for subscriber location data. Some of these demands were for the records of hundreds or even thousands of customers at a time.  Law enforcement agencies also regularly track cell phones with the use of a surveillance technology known as a cell site simulator or A recent bipartisan report by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives found that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have spent more than $95 million to buy over 430 Although Federal agencies now obtain warrants before using this technology, many State and local agencies do not.  There is currently no uniform legal standard that regulates how Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies are able to spy on the location of Instead, there exists a confusing patchwork of State laws, policies adopted by law enforcement agencies, and legal precedents set by Federal and State courts. As a result, Americans in one part of the country may enjoy less privacy, based on the policies adopted by their local police department, privacy laws passed by their State legislatures, or the willingness of their phone provider to push back in court, than Americans who happen to live in a privacy-superior jurisdiction. This patchwork quilt of rules and regulations has led to confusion among law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers, who waste valuable time and resources litigating and appealing what should be clear-cut rules--clear-cut rules that start from the premise that privacy is an inviolable right, not a convenience granted by local law enforcement.  Under President Obama, there was a policy in place that required Federal law enforcement officers to get a probable cause warrant before tracking an American's location. Under the current administration, we do not yet know if this policy will remain, which makes this bill even more critical.  This bill has three main components.  First, it requires the government to show probable cause and get a warrant before acquiring the geolocational information of a U.person, while setting out clear exceptions such as emergency or national security situations or cases of theft or fraud. This probable cause requirement would apply to all law enforcement acquisitions of the geolocational information of individual Americans without their knowledge. This requirement will include indirect location information acquisition from commercial service providers and direct acquisitions using Stingrays and similar devices, including tracking devices covertly installed by the government. This bill would regulate both real-time tracking of a person's movements, as well as the acquisition of records of past movements.  Second, the bill creates criminal penalties for secretly using an electronic device to track a person's movements that parallel those for wiretapping. Currently, if a woman's ex-husband taps her phone, he is breaking the law. This legislation would treat hacking her cell phone to track her movements as a similar offense.  Finally, it prohibits commercial service providers from sharing customers' geolocation information with outside entities without customer consent.  Passage of this bill would provide much needed privacy protections to Americans and ensure that location data is adequately protected from warrantless surveillance by law enforcement agencies.  I thank my colleagues Chaffetz and Conyers for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1219.txt,1247,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,15.0,January
