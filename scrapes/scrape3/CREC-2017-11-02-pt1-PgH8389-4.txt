                       REMEMBERING PAT GILBREATH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Aguilar) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of 
someone I was lucky to call a colleague and mentor--Redlands City 
Council member Pat Gilbreath.
  I was heartbroken to learn of Pat's passing in early October, but I 
will always be grateful for her countless contributions to our 
community. Her imprint can be seen throughout the city of Redlands and 
our region. She was the earliest advocate for Redlands' passenger rail, 
supported the Healthy Communities Initiative and Open Space Initiative 
to honor our citrus heritage.
  When I was just starting out on the city council, Pat's leadership 
and poise helped shape the type of public servant that I aim to be. She 
was pragmatic, measured, and listened intently to the public.
  I will always be thankful for everything that she taught me, not the 
least of which was how to hide the chocolate in the city council dais 
so we could eat it during our late night council meetings.
  A loving mother and grandmother, she was always proud to beam about 
her family. I know that when they look at her legacy and the impact she 
made in the community, her family can be just as proud of her.
  Pat will always be remembered in our region for her thoughtfulness, 
her dedication, and her problem-solving ability. I will always remember 
her for her friendship.
