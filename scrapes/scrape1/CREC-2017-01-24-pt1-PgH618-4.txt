                   LA ROSA BLANCA'S 58TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, January 28 marks the 58th anniversary 
of the founding of La Rosa Blanca, or as it is known in English, The 
White Rose.
  Founded by Rafael Diaz-Balart, The White Rose is an important 
organization that is dedicated to opposing Castro's Communist tyranny 
and to offering a blueprint for Cuba's future reconstruction. It 
promotes democracy and freedom and prepares for the day that Cuba will 
finally be returned to the people of Cuba.
  These ideas are embodied in The White Rose Institute, which is a 
nonprofit that was started by Rafael's son, my dear friend and 
legislative brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart. The White Rose Institute will 
honor two Cuban leaders who have come to embody Rafael's ideas: Jorge 
Luis Garcia Perez ``Antunez'' and Felicia Guillen Amador.
  Bravely fighting the Castro dictatorship for even the most basic of 
human rights, Antunez, Felicia, and those like them are the real future 
of Cuba, which is a future without the Castros' dictatorship, without 
the brutal repression. It is a future as Rafael and The White Rose 
envisioned--of freedom, sacred freedom.
