                         CONFIRM JUDGE GORSUCH

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues 
in the United States Senate to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. 
Supreme Court.
  Since being nominated by President Trump, Judge Gorsuch has provided 
unprecedented transparency and access. He has completed three rounds of 
intense questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which totaled 
nearly 20 hours and covered nearly 1,200 questions. This was the 
longest hearing of any nominee in the 21st century.
  During this time, Judge Gorsuch showed himself to be uniquely 
qualified and experienced to serve on our Nation's highest court. In 
fact, he showed the exact same qualification that previously earned him 
unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate in 2006 to serve on the Tenth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. Then-Senators Obama, Biden, Clinton, and 
Schumer were all serving in the Senate at that time and raised no 
objections whatsoever to Judge Gorsuch's nomination.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Senate to put politics aside and 
confirm Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.
