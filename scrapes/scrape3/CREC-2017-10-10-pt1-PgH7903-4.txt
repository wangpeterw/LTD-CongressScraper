                TRUMP RAMPS UP DEMANDS FOR NEW DACA DEAL

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague from Illinois 
and demand that the Children's Health Insurance Program that will help 
millions of children have healthcare be reauthorized now, and certainly 
it should be done before we leave for the work recess.
  I also want to hold up the headline of the Houston Chronicle that 
says: ``Trump Ramps Up Demands for New DACA Deal.''
  Sometimes we think that these are just statements that don't impact 
people's lives. The name of the young lady on this front page is Karen, 
who watches her parents work 17 hours a day, trying to ensure that the 
children who came here through no fault of their own can be 
contributing Americans.
  We stood together yesterday with 122,000 in the State of Texas. We 
thought we had a reasonable deal to be able to work together to help 
these young people. But with the ridiculous demands that have been made 
by this administration--$15 billion border wall, cutting legal 
immigration, sending out the door unaccompanied children--it is 
absolutely ludicrous.
  Does anyone care about human life.
  Then we stood together with the chief of police, the sheriff, the 
constables, and Moms Demand Action and fought against ridiculous 
nonregulation of guns that can kill people, military guns. We need gun 
safety legislation, and we need to do it now.
