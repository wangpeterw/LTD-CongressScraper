100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST VOTE CAST BY A WOMAN IN THE STATE OF NEW 
                                  YORK

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th 
anniversary of the first vote cast by a woman in the State of New York. 
100 years ago, the residents of Lisle, New York, and Broome County held 
a special election to decide if liquor could be served in the town of 
Lisle. This was the first vote held in the State of New York after 
women had just recently gained the right to vote just 2 months prior, 
thanks to the efforts of other famous New Yorkers who are memorialized 
in our historic Capitol rotunda: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton, and Lucretia Mott.
  On January 25, 1918, shortly after 6 a.m., right before the polls 
opened, on a cold, snowy day in the southern tier, the Ladies of Lisle 
lined up outside to cast their first vote. When the doors opened, a 
woman named Florence B. Chauncey was the first to step forward and 
place her ballot in the box at the Lisle Village Hall.
  This year, on January 5, a historic marker was unveiled at the old 
Lisle Village Hall to commemorate this momentous occasion. This 
extraordinary act will now be memorialized forever on the Main Street 
in Lisle.
