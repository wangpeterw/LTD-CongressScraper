    SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN BECOMING RANKING MEMBER OF THE SENATE 
                          JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate Judiciary Committee 
convenes for the first time in the 115th Congress, and we mark an 
historic moment in the committee's 200-year history. Last week, Senator 
Dianne Feinstein was named the committee's ranking member, the first 
time in American history that a woman has served in this capacity. It 
is striking that 352 Members have served on the committee, and only six 
of those--all Democrats--have been women. Three of those six women are 
proudly serving on this important committee today: Senator Feinstein, 
Senator Klobuchar, and Senator Hirono, whom we welcome back to the 
committee.
  Senator Feinstein has long been a leading voice on this committee. I 
have enjoyed working with her on countless issues ranging from national 
security to immigration reform to Supreme Court nominations. Senator 
Feinstein has broken down barriers throughout her career, and her new 
role as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee is only the latest 
example. As the committee grapples with some of the most pressing 
issues facing our country, we will all be counting on Ranking Member 
Feinstein's leadership. We should all congratulate her on this historic 
moment.
