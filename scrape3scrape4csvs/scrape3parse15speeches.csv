866,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to highlight the incredible work performed by those running the Alexandria Mega Shelter in my district during the Hurricane Harvey evacuation.  In Louisiana, we know too well how devastating hurricanes and flooding can be. When our neighbors in Texas needed help, Louisiana answered the call. At its peak, the Alexandria Mega Shelter housed 1,800 people displaced by Hurricane  I visited with some of the victims and the workers, and I want to share with you some of the amazing work that went on there. The shelter provided a roof and a bed for people whose homes were flooded and destroyed; but as a physician, I was most impressed with the medical response that I saw at the shelter. On short notice, local healthcare providers banded together to set up a clinic to meet the health needs of these displaced people, including dialysis patients who could not miss treatments; if they did, they could die. The clinic allowed most patients to be treated in-house right there in the Mega Shelter, making their stay in the shelter easier than it might have been otherwise.  Additionally, the shelter was able to send 1,800 pounds of donated medications and medical supplies to patients in Beaumont, Texas, whose people were struggling in the aftermath of the storm just to get the medicines they needed to survive themselves.  Local pilots and aviators donated air time and resources to fly these medicines and these badly needed supplies to Beaumont where they could help these good people.  I want to specifically mention the efforts of the Louisiana National Guard; the Louisiana State Police, including Superintendant Kevin Reeves and his troopers; Rapides Parish Sheriff William Earl Hilton and his deputies; and Azar Kayal and his staff at the Louisiana Department of Public Safety for their role in assisting the people at the shelter.  I also want to mention Spencer Tucker, Emily Smith Grezaffi, Laura Pickett, Melinda Sanders, Nici English, David Holcombe, and all those with the Louisiana Department of Health, and emergency and local pharmacies who helped meet the medical needs of all these people displaced at this one shelter.  Recovery from Harvey will be difficult, and now our prayers and thoughts are also with our friends in Florida who are dealing with the effects of Hurricane Irma that just passed. As tragic as these storms can be, they also tend to bring out the best in us as Americans, who always answer the call to serve and help those who are suffering. We are all one big family when these disasters hit.  Thank you to all those at the Alexandria Mega Shelter who welcomed these displaced people in their time of need and hopefully made their ordeal a little better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgH7226.txt,2244,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017.0,12.0,September

623,topic-id,228,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, each year the Federal Government uses civil asset forfeiture to take billions of dollars' worth of property from people who have not been charged with any crime. It is an unconstitutional practice that is used to violate the due process rights of innocent people.  Fortunately, some States have passed laws to limit asset forfeiture; but the Federal Government helps State law enforcement evade these requirements by doing adoptive forfeitures where the Federal Government accepts property seized by the State law enforcement, forfeits it under Federal law, and gives the State agency a cut of the proceeds.  Mr.Chairman, this practice is outrageous. It supplants the authority of States to regulate their own law enforcement, and it further mires the Federal Government in unconstitutional asset forfeitures.  In 2015, the Department of Justice placed limits on adoptive forfeiture, prohibiting the Federal Government from accepting property seized by local police when there is no involvement by Federal law enforcement and the property does not relate to public safety. These are commonsense restrictions that prevent the most egregious seizures.  Unfortunately, these restrictions were revoked in June of this year. My amendment would restore them by prohibiting the use of funds to do adoptive forfeitures that were banned under the 2015 rules.

480,topic-id,884,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today we are advancing another bill to support the men and women who answer the call to keep their neighbors safe.  Yesterday we honored the first responders and countless other Americans who were murdered in the September 11 terrorist attacks. We will never forget them, nor their great sacrifices of their families and loved ones.  I come from Pennsylvania, which has a proud history of service, from the National Guard to police, to fire houses, to Even one of our former Governors, Tom Ridge, was a key player in setting up the Department of Homeland  Today, we, in Congress, continue to work to reduce the blind spots that led to 9/11, and ensure our Nation's newest Department is able to get local law enforcement officers the resources that they need to keep our communities safe.  Having served as mayor of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, I have long known that it will be the police officer on the streets of Hazleton, Shamokin or Shippensburg, not some analyst in Washington, who will recognize when a member of our community has radicalized or been recruited by a gang or terrorist sect.  That is one of the reasons why I worked with the committee to introduce H.2443, the Department of Homeland Security Classified Facility Inventory  My bill strengthens information sharing between local, State, and Federal law enforcement by requiring the DHS to maintain an inventory of facilities certified to store information classified above the secret level.  This is a follow-up to the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017, which I first introduced last Congress and has successfully passed the committee in the  I come from a State with three fusion centers: the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center, known as PaCIC, in Harrisburg; Delaware Valley Intelligence Center in Philadelphia; and Southwestern PA Region 13 Fusion Center in  This bill is part of my efforts to make the DHS share information with its State and local partners.[[Page H7247]]                                {time}  1315  More and more, State and local officials are now getting the security clearances they need to get important national security information that will help them; however, gaps remain.  This bill will ensure that DHS is tracking the specific location of all the Department's secure facilities and make this information available to the appropriate State and local personnel as well as Department employees.  To be honest, it is frustrating that this legislation is even needed. Congress and DHS share the same goal of keeping our communities safe. We must make it clear that information needs to be shared to allow for proper oversight both now and in the future. Our State and local law enforcement officials are professionals and leaders of our communities. However, far too often, I have heard complaints that Federal officials do not take local information seriously simply because someone has not been able to obtain a certain security clearance. My legislation will help address this concern.  Specifically, this bill requires greater transparency and information sharing on the locations of all facilities certified by DHS to store classified infrastructure or systems above the secret level, commonly known as This will give local law enforcement the tools that they need to protect their communities and our Nation as a whole.  Additionally, by requiring DHS to maintain an updated list of all of these facilities, this bill will ensure that the Department does not invest in new facilities in areas already covered, in turn, reducing the chances of wasteful spending.  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, which passed the House once already as part of the larger DHS authorization bill in I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will realize the critical need for my bill and will act quickly so President Trump can sign it into law.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2443, the Department of Homeland Security Classified Facility Inventory Act of 2017.  This measure addresses a concern to many of us in the counterterrorism arena--the absence of a centralized inventory of classified systems within  DHS is the third largest Federal agency and has a vast footprint, yet DHS does not maintain a centralized list of all the spaces around the country where individuals with clearances can access classified information.  H.2443 tackles this issue by requiring DHS to maintain an inventory of all DHS certified facilities that house classified systems above the secret level on a regular basis. It requires DHS to share part or all of the inventory, in accordance with standard information-sharing procedures and policies. This legislation will enhance Congress' ability to assist DHS with protecting classified facilities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, H.2443 is an important piece of legislation. It has strong support on both sides of the aisle.  Extensive efforts have been made to enhance information sharing, establish the DHS intelligence enterprise, and support the National Network of Fusion It is important that DHS' partners at all levels know where to go to access classified information, particularly when a terrorist or other national security incident occurs.

381,topic-id,444,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3284, the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, in a crisis like the attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation's first responders--police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel--take on enormous responsibilities. They contain the situation, care for the injured, and keep people safe while putting their own lives at risk. These weighty responsibilities are central in terrorism-related crises.  Today there is an appreciation of the importance of the whole-of-Nation response where efforts among diverse stakeholders, including nontraditional first responders, are well coordinated and thoroughly planned.  The Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series is a program where one-day events are hosted across the country that bring people together who play a critical role in keeping their city's residents safe during a terrorist attack. The multicity series is a collaborative effort among Federal, State, local and private sector entities that empowers cities to provide the best response to an organized, coordinated, and multisite terrorist attack.  One of these workshops was conducted in Los Angeles, near my district. I represent the Port of Los Angeles--America's port. It touches every congressional district and faces a variety of threats that require coordinated preparation and response from Federal, State, and local agencies.  Enactment of H.3284, the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series Act, would codify this important program in law. Specifically, H.3284 requires the FEMA Administrator, in consultation with the Directors of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to establish a Joint Counterterrorism Workshop  Importantly, this bill requires that, at the conclusion of each event, the FEMA Administrator, in consultation with the NCTC and FBI Directors and officials from the participant city hosting the workshop series, provide all participants with an after-action report that includes key findings about lessons learned and best practices from the event, and potential mitigation strategies and resources to address gaps identified during the event.  I strongly support this counterterrorism training program, and I believe that Congress should show its support for the program by enacting this legislation. I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, H.3284 is an important piece of legislation that has strong support on both sides of the aisle. It empowers officials and individuals on the local level to come together to make their communities more secure.  This workshop series helps address new, evolving terrorist threats. It also enhances the ability of State and local jurisdictions to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terror attacks here in the homeland.

712,topic-id,390,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2470, the Homeland Threat Assessment Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, since the attacks of September 11, 2001, which claimed the lives of over 3,000 innocent people, the terrorist threat has metastasized and is decentralized. That was how then-DHS Secretary John Kelly described it in He went on to warn that ``the risk is as threatening today as it was that September morning almost 16 years ago.''  Whereas, in 2001, there was a centralized, well-funded terrorist organization planning and carrying out major attacks, today the landscape is a patchwork of small cells and lone wolves eager to embrace violence in furtherance of their terrorist ideology.  Today, we consider H.2470 a bill that requires DHS to conduct an assessment of the terrorist threat to the homeland on an annual basis. The factors to be considered include: data on terrorist incidents and activity in the U.S.; current and potential future terrorist tactics; cyber threats, particularly those to critical infrastructure and Federal IT networks; threats to surface and aviation transportation; and the efficacy of foreign terrorist propaganda.  In my district, these threats are an everyday reality for the Port of Los Angeles, which has the largest container volume in the country and faces threats to their shipping, cybersecurity, and infrastructure. This bill will help DHS assess those threats and provide the right response after an incident.  We learned from the September 11 attacks about the importance of recognizing and analyzing the ever-evolving terrorist threat landscape. This annual assessment will ensure that DHS comprehensively examines all forms of terrorism and extremism that could damage the homeland today so that, as a nation, we can be vigilant.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to again express my support for this bill and highlight a particular provision that seeks to strengthen interagency collaboration on examining the threat.  The provision requires DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis to continue working with fusion centers, which are the focal points for sharing threat-related information between Federal, State, local, and private sector partners.  DHS must continue to address and improve the Nation's fusion centers' capabilities in gathering, analyzing, and sharing threat-related information between partners on every level.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2427, Pathways to Improving Homeland Security at the Local Level  Sixteen years ago, the terrorist attacks of September 11 brought home the reality that terrorism prevention and preparedness is a shared Federal, State, and local responsibility.[[Page H7237]]  Today, the Department of Homeland Security's training catalog is a primary resource for State and local jurisdictions to find opportunities to enhance their counterterrorism and preparedness capabilities. H.2427 seeks to ensure that, going forward, this vital resource remains available to the first responder community.  Specifically, H.2427 directs DHS' Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to produce and distribute an annual catalog of DHS' training, programs, and services for State, local, and tribal law enforcement.  Further, to ensure that this information is shared throughout the law enforcement community, the Pathways to Improving Homeland Security at the Local Level Act requires this comprehensive catalog be posted on the DHS website, as well as on the Homeland Security Information  My district is home to the Coast Guard, DHS personnel, and officials from the Port of Los Angeles, who all have to work together to prepare and respond to threats. This bill would provide the information they need to work together and get the necessary training.  This measure, which was introduced by my Democratic colleague on the Homeland Security Committee, Representative Val Demings, highlights the importance of equipping law enforcement with necessary tools so that they can quickly adapt and discover new ways to evolve with the current terrorist threat landscape.  Enactment of this bill will further strengthen the Department's partnership with State and local law enforcement to help protect the homeland.  Mr.Speaker, H.2427 is an important piece of legislation that has strong support on both sides of the aisle.  Consideration of this measure today is particularly timely, as this week we remember those who sacrificed their lives and ran toward danger during the worst terrorist attack on U.soil.

Mr.Speaker, 16 years ago, Americans were jarred by the spectacle of the mighty Twin Towers collapsing and fires at the Pentagon and in a Pennsylvania field. The perpetrators of the attacks sought to bring the United States to its knees. While, without question, a deep wound that may never fully heal was inflicted on the heart of this Nation on that day, we remain strong and resolute.  We emerged from that devastating experience more determined and with lessons learned about the need for better information sharing, interoperability, and coordination.  One major reform was the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security as a multimission agency, which today has 240,000 men and women serving in a range of capacities at our land, air, and seaports, as well as in the field, working to protect critical infrastructure from cyber and other attacks.  The DHS Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act seeks to provide DHS employees with the opportunity to do a rotational assignment within the DHS' Intelligence and Analysis division.  By establishing this program, officers and analysts across the DHS who have a passion for keeping our Nation secure would be provided the opportunity to develop or broaden their intelligence and counterterrorism skills.

295,topic-id,361,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the recognition, and I want to begin by commending Chairman Cole, his staff, and the Appropriations Committee for the fine work that they have done.  As we are looking at the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill, we are looking at $156 billion for fiscal year 2018. My amendment would cut an additional 1 percent out of that number.  I think it is important to commend the work that they have done over the past couple of years. If you go back and look at the appropriations numbers in 2016, they were at $163.65 billion; 2017, down to $162.985 billion; and this year, at $156 billion.  I think that that work is to be commended. The leadership in this House, the chairman, Chairman Cole, and the work that they are doing is getting us on the right path. It is important that as we as Members of Congress do our job, it is important that we engage the[[Page H7302]]rank-and-file employees that are there in these various agencies--over at the Department of Education and at Labor and HHS--and make certain that they are saving that one penny out of a dollar, because we hit a pretty dubious marker this week.  Our national debt now is at $20 trillion, and because of this, because of the responsibility that we have to our children, to our grandchildren, to future generations, because we realize, as Admiral Mullen said on July 6, 2010, the greatest threat to our Nation's security is our Nation's debt, we need to do a little bit more. And, of course, there are always good programs that we can stand here and talk about, and talk about what will not be funded if we do a penny on a dollar.  But the important thing to realize is future generations, my grandchildren that are now 8 and 9 years old, are paying for programs that we are refusing to address the growth in these programs. We are committing money they have not earned, taxes they have not paid, because we are $20 trillion in debt.  It is time to make these changes, and I reserve the balance of my time.

217,topic-id,515,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to increase funding for senior nutrition programs under title III of the Older Americans My amendment funds these programs at levels authorized by the House just last year.  We are in the middle of an unprecedented demographic shift as this country ages. The population of older adults is growing faster than at any point in history. As we grow older, we all want people across the country to be able to age with dignity, health, and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  For more than 50 years, the Older Americans Act has supported community-based providers that reach more than 11 million seniors and caregivers annually in each and every one of our districts providing person-centered assistance to help people age in place. These critical OAA services include home-delivered and congregate meals to make sure that older adults are getting the nutrition needed to keep them healthy and engaged, which reduces the risk of falls, depression, and other negative outcomes.  Just a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of joining dedicated volunteers to deliver Meals on Wheels to seniors in northwest I highly recommend this to my colleagues. You can see firsthand the value of these programs and how important these meals and visits are to our constituents who rely on them.  The Older Americans Act also covers transportation to get older adults to the doctor, the grocery store, or even to a local senior center to engage with friends and avoid isolation. The OAA funds critical disaster assistance response efforts for seniors and communities like those just devastated by Hurricanes Harvey and  Unfortunately, funding for the Older Americans Act has drastically lagged behind the growth in the older adult population, the increasing need for services, and the rising cost of delivering these supports. This stagnant and, in some areas, eroding Federal investment in OAA programs costs us more in the long term. When seniors can't stay healthy at home, they end up in hospitals paid for by Medicare or in institutional long-term care, often funded by Both are far more expensive than adequate investments in the Older Americans Act to keep seniors healthy at home for as long as possible.  Support for the Older American Act is strongly bipartisan. Last year, Congress voted without opposition to reauthorize the Older Americans Act, a bill that included modest increases in authorized funding levels.  Unfortunately, annual appropriations still fall woefully short of these[[Page H7292]]amounts we clearly and firmly approved. This amendment will increase funding for core OAA programs delivered through title III--which include critical nutrition, home- and community-based support, and caregiver services--to the amounts that were just so broadly supported last year.  These investments in OAA are necessary if we are to provide the person-centered, cost-effective in-home services and supports needed to keep our expanding older population healthy and independent in their homes and communities. This amendment is an essential first step toward rectifying the recent depletion of these important funds for these vital programs.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

857,topic-id,1108,"Mr.President, I rise today to pay tribute to the legendary University of Arkansas football coach, Frank Broyles, who passed away August 14 at the age of 92. He spent his life in service to the university, its student athletes, and our great  I was fortunate to have been recruited by and played for Coach Broyles as an offensive tackle in the early 1970s. For a kid from Arkansas, this was a dream come true. Outside of family, the people who have had the greatest influences on my life were my coaches, teachers, pastors, friends, and certainly Coach Broyles is right at the top. He was an icon in Arkansas and a legend in collegiate athletics.  As head coach of the Razorback football team from 1958 to 1976, he turned the school's program into a national powerhouse. During his tenure, Coach Broyles led the Razorbacks to seven Southwest Conference titles, and a Football Association of America national championship. Coach Broyles had tremendous charisma and had a remarkable ability to attract and develop talent--both players and coaches. He wasn't afraid to seek out talent to support him, and he had an innate ability to see the strengths in people. He would turn them loose to use those strengths to help the team and those individuals succeed. His recipe was to get great people around him to help the program win while helping those individuals get to where they wanted to be in their own professional careers.  The roster of assistants under Coach Broyles reads like a Who's Who in NFL and college football: great coaches such as Jimmy Johnson, Barry Switzer, Johnny Majors, Joe Gibbs, Raymond Berry, and Hayden Fry--and the list goes on and on. They were once Coach Broyles' assistants. His legacy of producing great assistant coaches is recognized in an award named in his honor to recognize college football assistant coaches for the work they do. Since 1996, the Broyles Award has been given annually to the top assistant coach in college football.  Frank Broyles' impact on the University of Arkansas went well beyond the football field. He implemented his vision for Arkansas athletics as the athletic director for more than three decades, helping the university's men's program win 43 national championships during his tenure. When he retired from the position in 2007, he continued his devotion to the University of Arkansas working as a fundraiser at the Razorback  Coach Broyles used his notoriety for his most important mission, which he undertook in his later years. He became a passionate advocate for finding a cure for Alzheimer's and educating Americans on caring for loved ones suffering from this disease when his wife Barbara lost her battle with Alzheimer's in 2004. He shared the experience of his family as caregivers to his beloved Barbara across Arkansas and brought his story to Capitol Hill, where he encouraged lawmakers to be passionate about Alzheimer's so we can find a cure. He told Members they need to turn that compassion into passion to make a difference.  Coach Broyles spent his final years showing his passion for fighting Alzheimer's and helping other families touched by the disease. When his family was learning the best way to care for Barbara, they found there were limited resources available to caregivers looking for assistance. That is one of the reasons they created the Broyles Foundation and were inspired to share what they had learned in caring for Barbara to help other caregivers. The culmination of that effort was a book, ``Coach Broyles' Playbook for Alzheimer's Caregivers,'' which has been translated into 11 languages and distributed across the country.  After years of advocacy on behalf of those suffering from Alzheimer's and their families, the disease he fought so passionately to find a cure for ultimately took his life as well. One of the best ways we can honor Coach Broyles' legacy is by continuing to fund research in search of a cure for this devastating disease.  Coach Broyles brought the same energy to fighting Alzheimer's that he brought to college football and his work on behalf of the University of Arkansas on and off the field. He made a tremendous mark on the lives of so many student athletes during his years as a coach, athletic director, and all-around ambassador for the University of Arkansas and for our  I was one of the many who learned from the example Coach Broyles set. His leadership, faith, and ability to attract talent and utilize it to make our State a better place has been a tremendous influence on me through the years. I will be forever proud to be a Razorback and to have had the opportunity to play for Coach  Coach Broyles was fond of saying there are two types of people in the world: givers and takers. Live your life as a giver, not a taker. We lost a giver, but we are so much better for what he gave us.                     Honoring Deputy Timothy Braden  Mr.President, I would also like to pay respect to a law enforcement officer in my home State of Arkansas who lost his life in the line of duty, Thursday, August 24, 2017.  Drew County Sheriff's Deputy Timothy Braden gave his life while serving and protecting the citizens of Deputy Braden was a selfless servant who made a career out of helping others. He joined the Drew County sheriff's office in February after serving 3 years at the McGehee Police  He is remembered as a kind and hard-working officer who performed his job with a positive attitude. He had an appreciation for law enforcement and had aspirations of serving as an Arkansas State Police trooper. I am grateful for Deputy Braden's commitment to the community. He represents the selfless service of our men and women who turn toward danger to protect communities and bring criminals to justice.  He showed his dedication to the community in many ways, including being a former member of the Arkansas National Guard and a former Eagle Scout of the Year in his hometown, Star Deputy Braden's ultimate sacrifice reminds us all of the risks members of the law enforcement community face on a daily basis.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Deputy Braden's family, including his wife and four young children, his friends, and the law enforcement community. I pray they will find comfort during such a difficult time as this.  I join all Arkansans as we express our gratitude for Deputy Braden's service and sacrifice.  With that, I yield the floor.

And their only option for recourse has been taken away.  When I was District Attorney in Northern Colorado I met a man who told me that when he was in college he bounced a check to his landlord. He pleaded guilty to a felony.  Since that day, he has been a model citizen. He finished college. He worked hard and raised a family.  This man made a mistake that is still haunting him nearly 40 years later. He wants to take his grandchildren hunting. But he can't possess a firearm because he made a mistake in his youth.  The worst part of this situation is that the law allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to consider petitions to restore this man's right to possess a firearm.  However, for 25 years, the underlying bill has included a provision authored by then-Schumer prohibiting ATF from processing these applications.  America is a land of second chances. We restore civil rights for those who have made mistakes in their past, including the right to vote in many states. We help our neighbors find employment after incarceration.  Why should non-violent individuals who made a mistake in their past be prohibited from having their case heard?  This amendment simply seeks to remove a 25-year-old ban on the ATF's legal function to hear petitions from non-violent individuals like the man I mentioned earlier.  To be clear, my amendment would not act as a rubber stamp on every application. The ATF must weigh the merits of each individual case.  The burden is on the applicant to prove that he or she is nonviolent and does not pose a threat to the community.  Any American who can prove to ATF they do not pose a danger to society should be allowed to state their case. They should be allowed to advocate for their rights.

611,topic-id,417,"Mr.Chairman, I rise to speak about my amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies division of H.3354.  Mr.Chairman, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP, is intended to further local law enforcement's ability to adhere to Federal immigration law. SCAAP provides States and localities with Federal funds to help offset correctional costs related to incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens with at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions.  However, in recent years, the number of jurisdictions receiving SCAAP funding that have adopted sanctuary policies, allowing violent criminal aliens to go free, has skyrocketed. My amendment would cut off SCAAP money for cities that violate the intent of these funds. These sanctuary cities must not continue using taxpayer money to flagrantly violate Federal immigration law and put American citizens at risk.  Look no further than my home State of Colorado in the case of Mr.Ever Back in October, Mr.Valles was picked up on charges, including possession of a weapon, vehicle theft, and eluding. He also had a history of gang involvement.  ICE placed a detainer on Mr.Valles, but Denver officials failed to honor the Federal detainer, releasing him without providing the proper notice to ICE officials. Upon his release, Mr.Valles took part in robbing and shooting 32-year-old Tim Cruz at an RTD train station. He has been charged with first-degree murder.  Sanctuary policies just don't break the law. They place people's lives in danger. We cannot continue allowing these jurisdiction sanctuary cities to use taxpayer money to further these misguided policies. In fact, the Office of Justice Programs' own website states that applicants for SCAAP funds are required to certify compliance with all applicable Federal laws at the time of application. It goes on to say that, if the OJP receives information indicating that an applicant violated the statute related to sanctuary policies, that the applicant will be investigated by the inspector general and could be subject to criminal and civil penalties.  A recent U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency report identified the top 10 jurisdictions with the highest volume of detainers issued that restrict cooperation with Not surprisingly, every one of those sanctuary cities received SCAAP awards in fiscal year 2016.

While this built upon prior studies that have examined the link between firefighting and cancer, our understanding of this connection is still limited. To improve our ability to alleviate the health risks that these public servants face, Representatives Collins and Pascrell introduced H.931. This will authorize funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a national registry for the collection of data pertaining to cancer incidence among firefighters.  This national registry will fill the void in our understanding of the health risks that our firefighters face and better prepare us to care for them.  Yesterday did mark the 16th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. We are reminded of the firefighters' willingness to run toward danger to help anyone who is in harm's way. Across our country, firefighters answer the call whenever our families or our communities are in need. Supporting these important public health bills is one way we can give back to these heroes, and I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.931.

313,topic-id,426,"Mr.Chair, tonight I am proud to introduce an amendment that will fully fund the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting program, colloquially known as NASPER has long provided us with an opportunity to help prevent the spread of opioids across the country; however, until now, we have not funded it.  NASPER funding supports the development and maintenance of a State-run prescription drug monitoring program. These prescription drug monitoring programs allow for doctors and pharmacists to electronically interconnect with one when prescribing opioids, allowing for the providers to confer and ensure that the patient is not receiving a duplicate opioid prescription that the patient may then divert or sell.  Prescription drug monitoring programs work because they engage providers and they successfully prevent individuals from exploiting weaknesses in the healthcare system.  During any epidemic, it is important to first help those in need and provide support to individuals and first responders who were impacted by the epidemic. Last year, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on Health did exactly this.[[Page H7307]]We worked to put forth the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to provide support for those impacted by the opioid epidemic by increasing access to those in need.  No epidemic response, however, is complete without preventative measures, and that is why NASPER is so important to this fight. We must prioritize programs like NASPER that are preventative and can ensure that errant prescribers and bad actors do not fall through the cracks. If we want to end this epidemic, we must commit resources to programs that will promote prevention and encourage safer prescribing of prescription drugs.  As the subcommittee chairman for the authorizing committee that has been tasked with the public health response to a crisis that claimed more than 60,000 American lives last year, I am committed to further working to oversee the implementation of our initial response efforts and to develop any supplemental responses that may be needed to prevent future unnecessary deaths.

Thanks to Don's unstinting passion and dedication to environmental issues, UMCES has had a profoundly positive impact on improving the health of Maryland's environment, playing a major role in the university's mission to enhance the quality of life in Maryland and our region. UMCES has become recognized as the State's foremost research authority on environmental matters that are critical to Maryland and the Nation, from enhancing the health of the Chesapeake Bay to restoring our State's oyster population.  Don Boesch has been an extremely effective leader of people. He worked with the University of Maryland Baltimore County and the University of Maryland, Baltimore to form a novel research partnership, the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology, located on Baltimore's Inner He spearheaded the effort to design and construct the state-of-the-art research vessel Rachel Carson to help understand and monitor the Chesapeake Bay and coastal Atlantic He led UMCES, a longtime partner in graduate education and classroom instruction with the University of Maryland, to receive accreditation to award joint graduate degrees in environmental science.  Don has been involved in research on the Chesapeake Bay for more than 35 years, becoming one of the Nation's most widely recognized and respected experts in applying science to public policies for the protection, sustainable use, and restoration of coastal ecosystems. He has been an official adviser to Federal agencies, the Chesapeake Bay Program, and five Maryland He is a member of the Governor's Chesapeake Bay He has also served as chair of the Ocean[[Page S5101]]Studies Board of the National Academy of Sciences and member of the National Academies Committee on America's Climate In 2007, he won the ``Award for Lifetime Leadership in Ecosystem Restoration, National Conference on Ecosystem Restoration.'' In 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Don to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore In 2015, he earned the ``Admiral of the Chesapeake Award,'' which was presented to him by the  Don's interest in coastal watershed science probably came naturally; he was born and raised in New Orleans, and he received his B.in biology from Tulane University in 1967. He went on to earn a Ph.in oceanography from the College of William & Mary in 1971. He was awarded a Fulbright postdoctoral fellowship to study in Australia and then spent 8 years on the faculty at the Virginia Institute of Marine From 1980 to 1990, he served as the first executive director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium and worked as a professor of Marine Science at Louisiana State He returns to the gulf coast frequently to lead task forces and scientific panels on gulf ecosystem protection and restoration.  Donald Boesch has had an exemplary career at the intersection of science and public policy. He has been incredibly helpful to me and the rest of the Maryland congressional delegation; we have all valued his wise counsel. I am comforted by the fact that, while Don is stepping down as president of UMCES on September 17, he will join the faculty and focus his energies on completing several research publications. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Don on this milestone event and thanking him for his extraordinary contributions to understanding and protecting our environment.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-11-pt1-PgS5100-2.txt,,1245,2017.0,11.0,September

My friend, Mr.Scott, may have the best solution of all: let's plus-up both of these programs because they both do a lot of good.  But, in this case, I don't think you make one the enemy of the other. I have seen TRIO programs work, and I have seen how many jobs they produce. We are not serving anywhere close to the population eligible for Somewhere less than 10 percent of the eligible students actually take advantage of the program.  Again, my State invests very heavily, probably more heavily than most other States that I would suggest do the same thing Ohio and Oklahoma have done. And these programs which my friend rightly champions, I have seen people actually raise their own taxes so they could have a career or technical institute.  So I think there is merit to both of these approaches. But I do also think 5 million college graduates from people who did not have the chance to go is something this country ought to think about. The statistics tell us each of those graduates in a lifetime earn $1 million more than they would have. I promise you, the Federal Government will get its share of that million dollars.  This is a program that has paid for itself over and over again. Perhaps as we go forward, we can find other ways to help both of these programs capitalize on their potential.

So I know the commitment to fiscal responsibility is serious and continuing and real. I particularly want to thank her for her kind words about the work of the committee in recent years because we genuinely have tried to continuously lower the amounts of money.  My friend makes a very good point about the dangers we face in terms of a skyrocketing national debt, but as my friend suggests, we have already cut this more than 1 percent. I am not suggesting there aren't areas that can be cut additionally. There probably are. But as an appropriator, we prefer to look at things individually, one at a time, because there are always areas that could be plussed-up as well.  I don't think anybody here really wants to cut money, even 1 percent, from cancer funding or Alzheimer's research or Pell grants or programs that we think actually help folks have an educational choice, like charter schools, and yet that is always the impact of an across-the-board cut. You cut things that need to be cut, for sure, but you also cut some things that probably shouldn't be.  So we would prefer to continue the approach that my friend has singled out and said that seems to work well, and we will do that, and I know she will be helpful in that.

The amendment offered--and this is an important point I think many Members in this body don't think about--is actually for a newly authorized program that has not received funding in the past, and our committee actually has a smaller allocation than it had last year. I think most of the public doesn't realize it, and it is sort of helpful, frankly, for my friend to advance this amendment. Just because something moves through an authorizing committee doesn't mean any money comes with it.  Now, in some cases--my friend worked on the Cures bill--they sent money with portions of that on the opioid initiatives, some additional money at NIH, and, of course, every penny of that has moved in. They found a way to fund it. But we can end up in a situation where you just simply pile on authorizations and send us less money and think we will somehow work it out. Sometimes we do. That is why we have been able to steadily increase funding at NIH, steadily increase funding for programs like TRIO and GEAR UP, and steadily increase money for charter schools. There are some areas we have been able to do that, but we can't do it everyplace.  I want to tell my friend that, while I oppose the amendment, I am certainly going to work with him. Actually, I asked him not too long ago to give me the one thing that is the most important thing, and he mentioned the lack of trained and qualified personnel, that we could have a lot of programs, but until we had a bigger pool of people capable of rendering the services, then we simply are going to be moving from program to program. I think that was a very good point, and it is why I accepted my friend's amendment for $10 million to begin to do that. That is another area. I think we have to pick a few pressure points here.

307,topic-id,371,"Mr.Chairman, once again, I agree with my friend on the basic point, but this, too, is a program that was authorized with no funding.  The things we got funding for in the 21st Century Cures Act, we funded to the penny. Frankly, things we didn't get funding for, we still authorized.  This is one of those cases where, again, the cause is worthy, and we are willing to work with the gentleman--and we will certainly continue to do that--but a lot of these things that my friend just mentioned are from programs that were authorized by non-appropriations committees. We don't create the programs.  That is where my friends, frankly, on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee need to spend some time. They need to spend some time deauthorizing certain programs that continue.  Again, I will work with my friend if our allocation changes or we can find additional savings. But I can't willy-nilly, particularly when we have already cut these administrative programs, partly in the en bloc amendment, to fund some of the very things, including my friend's amendment, that we felt were very worthy. We will look at this.  The other thing that I would hope we could do is work with our friends on the other side of the aisle. I will just tell you, from a conference standpoint, when you go to a conference with a program that has been authorized but not funded, it is extremely difficult to get the other body to join in with you. That is just the reality.  Every decision involves taking something away. It is always easy to call something administration or nonvital. That is what it looks like in the phrase. That may or may not be what it is in the program. So it is just a more difficult exercise than I think most folks understand.  My friend's point is still the right one. One of the reasons I look very carefully at this one is because I see it as a multiplier, in terms of the professional shortage of people that we have that my friend has pointed to.  Mr.Chairman, again, I reluctantly oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgH7291-2.txt,2259,HOMELAND THREAT ASSESSMENT ACT,2017.0,12.0,September

This amendment, in my view, mirrors, to some degree, the last administration's regulation on so-called Fair Play and Safe Workplaces, also known as a blacklisting rule, which has recently been withdrawn.  There are existing requirements for reporting and addressing violations of labor laws by Federal contractors. Indeed, hundreds of companies every year are barred from doing business with the Federal  While bad actors certainly should face consequences, I believe blanket prohibitions circumvent proper administrative review under the existing procedures. Agencies already have many requirements related to the award of Federal contracts, and imposing a new across-the-board requirement, in my view, is not the right approach to address this issue.

It is impossible to visit Israel without feeling the weight of history, from Biblical times to modern day. Staying in Jerusalem, seeing Bethlehem up close, viewing Israel from atop the Golan Heights, and traveling all along the Jordan River, all made a lasting impression.  My time in Israel also impressed me on Israel's undeniable security needs in the face of the persistent threat from Iran and its proxies in Syria and Lebanon, as well as the instability and violence stemming from the long-running conflict with the  Listening to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation to our congressional delegation greatly enhanced my level of support for Israeli foreign aid, just as listening to the Palestinian Authority's presentation greatly enhanced my opposition to foreign aid for  For these reasons, I believe U.security assistance to Israel should continue to be a high priority, and I am proud that defense collaboration between our two countries has yielded many important developments, including the Arrow anti-ballistic missile system, which is among the top missile shield technologies in the world.  Considering the growing threat of North Korea's nuclear missile program and Iran's ballistic missile development, it is clear that our efforts in this field are more important now than ever.  In addition to our successful cooperation on defense, the U.and Israel also work together on many other issues. One of these issues that is of particular interest to me is agriculture. I never dreamed that Israel's agriculture industry would be as advanced as it was.  Despite a very challenging ecosystem, Israel produces enough food to feed their entire country, as well as boasts a very impressive agriculture export market.  In conclusion, I believe the close working relationship between our two governments will remain critically important for many years to come, and I am grateful for the opportunity to advance these ties in one small way through my visit last month.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgH7227-2.txt,99999999999999,1215,2017.0,12.0,September

Like Hurricane Harvey in my home State of Texas, the devastation in places like Marco Island and Orange County means tough days and long nights ahead for the residents there.  My prayers, like those of so many others, go out to those who have been impacted by this devastating storm, including those who evacuated safely but will soon travel back to Florida, finding that everything they had is gone as a result of the storm.  As Irma continues to affect Florida and the southeastern United States, we stand ready to support the people in those States just like so many did for us in Texas with Hurricane                        Remembering September 11  Mr.President, on another separate note, as we all have seen and recall, today is the solemn anniversary of a day that has had an even more profound impact on our country than the recent storms. September 11 will always be remembered as the day that never quite goes away, the day that remains a reminder of what can be taken from us in the blink of an eye.  I have always said that it is etched in my memory like only one other event in my lifetime, and that was in 1963 with the assassination of President John I remember where I was and what I was doing at that time when I first heard about it. Of course, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I learned of the[[Page S5089]]terrible events of 9/11. I was on the telephone talking to a colleague of mine when my wife said: You need to see what is happening on the television. I turned on the TV just in time to see the second plane hit the towers in  Yes, it was 16 years ago that 19 Islamic terrorists snuck into our country in defiance of our laws and attended flight schools in defiance of all propriety. Sixteen years ago today, they hijacked four commercial planes full of innocent passengers and, at 8:46 a.m. on Tuesday morning, flew the first one directly into one of the tallest buildings in our largest city in the United  Seventeen minutes later--the event, which my wife directed my attention to on the TV set--the second plane hit, and shortly thereafter, flight 77 slammed into the western wall of the Pentagon, and Flight 93 crashed in Thanks to the heroic actions of passengers on Flight 93, that plane could have very well headed here to Washington and crashed into the Capitol, taking who knows how many lives along with it.  As it was, 3,000 people were killed that day, and afterward almost 300 million U.citizens saw the world anew through fresh eyes. The terrorists must have thought they could bring our Nation down, topple it as they did the twin towers, but they badly miscalculated. They were wrong. An America shocked was an America strengthened. America is sometimes called the slumbering giant which, once awakened, is a fearsome thing to behold, and that is exactly what happened after 9/11. After we all took many deep breaths and thanked God for what was left, we stood up and we fought back, united.  We primarily did that through our military--the core of our national defense--those who took the fight to al-Qaida in places like Afghanistan but also all the rest who surrounded and supported our Armed Forces and intelligence personnel every step of the way.  Sixteen years later, we continue to confront new terrorist threats and adjust to new geopolitical realities. I recall the statement of the former Director of National Intelligence, who said, after 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of threats confronting America than he did at that time, and nothing has changed in that respect, which is why today America must maintain a sense of vigilance, a sense of purpose, and a sense of moral clarity regarding evil in all of its novel forms.  We must also ask if we are still standing behind our Armed Forces the way we committed to do following the terrible events of 9/11. We must make sure our military servicemembers have everything they need because to do otherwise is to shirk our duty and to forget how our national security is ultimately achieved.  One way we uphold that responsibility is through the National Defense Authorization If passed, this would mark the 55th year it is signed into law. Later today, we will vote to take up this legislation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting that vote.  The Defense authorization bill ensures that crucial Department of Defense programs are continued and establishes how our military funds will be spent. The version of the bill which has been reported out of committee helps reverse the readiness crisis created by the previous administration. In the words of my friend, our colleague from Texas, Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, ``We have too few planes that can fly, too few ships that can sail and too few soldiers who can deploy.'' That sums up the situation exactly.  The Defense authorization bill exemplifies our commitment to reverse this downward trend. I don't know why it is that America tries to cash the peace dividend at every turn when we have no peace, but that is what has happened. Although the hole the previous administration placed us in is deep, this bill authorizes the funds necessary to begin restoring readiness, rebuilding capacity, and modernizing military infrastructure.  I was recently at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, TX, the base which trains half of all Air Force pilots in the country. They told me one of the biggest problems they have is recruiting and retaining pilots for the U.Air While people will accept lower wages for military service because they believe in serving the country, if, because of cuts in funding for the Air Force and for the military, they simply can't fly like they need to in order to be ready for the next fight, many of them get discouraged and are tempted to go to work in the private sector where they can earn more money. So we need to make sure our troops--all of our Armed Forces--have the readiness capability, and we need to fund that appropriately.  This bill will authorize appropriations for personnel and equipment, including aircraft made in my home State--the Osprey, made in Amarillo, TX, and the F-35 made in Fort  Finally, the Senate version will also authorize critical funding to increase maritime capacity as well. Back in the 1980s, the Navy had about 600 ships; today, we have 277, less than half. It is crucial that we procure ships, aircraft, and munitions, continue to develop our new military technology on our existing platforms and in the evolving cyber domain, and reduce our shortfall in end strength--that we do all of those things. These steps will provide our servicemembers with the training and equipment necessary to defeat ISIS, al-Qaida, and terrorist and state actors that threaten the United States and our way of life.  Perhaps even more significant, in terms of the threat to the United States and world peace, sending a message to Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation that America is no longer in retreat, but America can be relied upon as a strong partner, and America's leadership role in world affairs will be reestablished, will send a very important message of deterrence to the bullies, the tyrants, and the authoritarians around the world; to China, another major threat to international security and peace that is being so aggressive in not only developing arms that allow it to project power to different parts of the Pacific and beyond but threatens maritime transit and safe travel through places like the Strait of Malacca, where so much international trade and national security travel occur.  Our colleagues in the House have passed their version of the Defense authorization, and now it is our job to get it done. By passing a strong defense bill and authorizing the sort of resources our military needs in order for America to maintain its leadership role in the world and provide a credible threat to deter aggression on the part of our adversaries, we will leave our Nation and the world a safer place and better off. It is one small way today that we can honor the memory of those we lost 16 years ago.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

244,topic-id,343,"Mr.Chair, this, I think, is a very modest amendment, which just simply seeks to restore a cut to the existing 2017 level of support for the Magnet Schools Assistance Program, which is a program which has been around for quite a while. It actually was reauthorized in the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015, which was a great bipartisan success for K-12 education.  And again, this program provides support for magnet schools all across the country. There are 4,340 magnet schools in the U.3.5 million students benefit from magnet programs, which again, are administered by local school districts and utilize a variety of academic themes such as STEM, Language Immersion, Career and Technical Education, Visual and Performing Arts, just to name a few.  Again, it is a strategy which also provides a regional structure to the student population and promotes diversity. It has done great things in terms of Connecticut in terms of ending racial isolation. Again, unfortunately, the magnet schools have sort of seen a steady sort of decline from 10 years ago in terms of Federal support for it, and this amendment really is just basically saying enough. I mean, we should, again, restore an amount, which I indicated is very modest, of $1.1 million to this account, and offset and paid for.  And again, I think it just will allow a lot of school districts and communities to continue the great work that they are doing with magnet programs.  I want to conclude my initial remarks by, again, thanking the chairman and also Congresswoman Lee for their kind remarks about my colleague and neighbor from Connecticut, Rosa DeLauro, who lost her mother, Luisa DeLauro, a 103-year-old amazing woman.  We all marvel at Rosa's energy and passion, but if you have ever met Luisa, you would understand where it came from because she was an amazing woman, just a great inspiration for her daughter who, I think, made her so proud in terms of the great work that she has done in the  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

251,topic-id,273,"Mr.Chair, again, briefly, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I would just note, though, if you go back 10 years ago, the disparity between charter school funding at the Federal level versus magnet schools was two to one in favor of charters.  We are at a point today where, with this budget, it will be four to one in terms of disparity between the two. I would acknowledge the gentleman's comments that there are some areas where charter schools have provided great benefits, but there is no question that, in terms of breaking down racial isolation, magnet schools have a much better batting average, and that has been studied and reported over the years.  My daughter attended a magnet school in the Hartford area, and again, with a totally diverse population, and again, it is probably the most highly rated high school, secondary school, in the State of Connecticut, according to U.News and World  So again, the quality of magnet schools, I think, are high in the record in terms of their goal, which is to break down racial isolation. I think it surpasses charter schools.  This amendment would leave a 7.7 percent increase in funding for charter schools. It is not an attack on charter school funding. It just simply restores last year's level of spending for magnet schools, a very modest measure.  And again, I look forward, hopefully, to working with the gentleman, but I really believe strongly that this is not asking too much to protect magnet school funding, and that is why I would ask the Chamber to support this amendment.

These bipartisan amendments, cosponsored by me and my friend Mr.LoBiondo of New Jersey, protect critical functions at the National Weather The Weather Service is essential to so much of what we do. From its critical functions like helping us predict, prepare for, and ride out extreme weather events to its everyday functions like telling us whether or not to carry an umbrella, life without up-to-date weather information is hard to imagine.  My first amendment (89) directs the National Weather Service not to cut $1.2 million from the Climate Prediction one of its National Centers for Environmental Protection The Service is further directed not to consolidate the functions of the Climate Prediction Center into the Weather Prediction Keeping these two centers separate recognizes the essential and very different services each one provides. The medium- and long-term predictions offered by the Climate Prediction Center are used for planning by diverse industries including transportation, agriculture, energy, and public health. Its global datasets are used by the Department of Defense and the U.Agency for International Development to understand international phenomena like flood and drought that could impact food supplies and regional stability.  My second amendment (88) directs the National Weather Service not to cut $10.1 million from its budget for Information Technology Officers, and to maintain an on-site IT Officer at each Weather Forecast These officers do software maintenance, technical systems upgrades, and develop software and data products to meet local office needs. According to the Weather Service's assessment of its performance during Hurricane Matthew (2016), ``[Weather Forecast Offices] were unanimous in their support of having a local [IT Officer] present to address issues before, during, and after hurricane season.'' In addition, a significant number of IT Officers are also trained, experienced meteorologists who can augment the forecasting staff during extreme weather.  I think all of my colleagues can agree that supporting the National Weather Service is more important now than ever and I urge support for these amendments and for the en bloc package.

After Ohio reformed civil asset forfeiture laws, local agencies have been able to bypass, just as the gentleman from Michigan described.

With three MBDA Business Centers in Florida, including one in my home district, we in Florida understand the value the MBDA provides. In 2012, Florida had the third highest number of minority-owned businesses, in the country, with a high concentration of: African American-owned firms; Native American-owned firms; Asian American-owned firms; Hispanic American-owned firms; and Native Hawaiian & Pacific Islander-owned firms. All that rely on the assistance of the  For 48 years, the MBDA has been the only government agency focused solely on fostering the growth and development of minority-owned businesses; identifying and assisting to overcome the barriers to economic growth.  According to the 2007 U.Census Bureau's Survey on Business Owners, minority-owned businesses contributed $1 trillion in economic growth to the $16 trillion U.economy, and employed 6 million Additionally, minority-owned businesses are twice as likely to generate sales through exports, compared to non-minority owned firms, due to their language and cultural ties.  While their economic contributions are significant, minority-owned businesses struggle in acquiring private capital and securing government contracts at disproportionate rates, compared to non-minority owned businesses.[[Page H7256]]Studies have also shown that minority loan-seekers are given less information on loan terms and offered less help with their loan applications. They are also denied loans at three times higher than non-minority firms.  The MBDA assists minority-owned businesses in: financing, joint ventures, and more. Firms assisted by MBDA secure an average of $5.4 billion dollars in contracts and investments. Given this significant contribution to the U.economy, it is vital to support the work done by the MBDA to grow our nation's 8.5 million minority-owned business.  I want to thank Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Serrano for including this amendment in the en bloc amendment. I would also like to thank my colleagues, Representatives Butterfield, Jackson Lee, and Velazquez for their co-sponsorship of my amendment, and for their previous work on these important issues.  Mr.Chair, the en bloc amendment also includes my amendment, number 95, which increases funding for the Office of Juvenile Justice Programs' Youth Mentoring Grants by $5 million--restoring those grants to the Fiscal Year 2017 enacted level.  These grants allow local jurisdictions to develop, expand or sustain youth mentoring efforts using evidence-based best practices.  Mr.Chair, improving outcomes for disadvantaged youth requires more than simply expanding opportunities at school, because the challenges they face often extend beyond the schoolhouse door.  In my 27 years in law enforcement, I saw this first-hand. As Chief of Police for the City of Orlando, Florida, I had the honor of founding Operation Positive Direction--a program through which OPD Officers mentor Orlando youths.  Across the nation, youth participating in these programs show improvements in their perception of social support and acceptance, their family relationships and a decrease in antisocial behaviors. Youth that meet regularly with their mentors are 46 percent less likely to start using illegal drugs, and youth that face opportunity gaps, but have a mentor are 55 percent more likely to go to college.  Again, I want to thank Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Serrano for including amendment number 95 in the en bloc amendment as well. I would also like to thank my colleagues, Representatives Langevin and Butterfield, not only for their co-sponsorship of my amendment, but for their continued leadership on these issues.  I urge all my colleagues to support the en bloc amendment.  The Acting The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Culberson).

652,topic-id,376,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of this bloc, which includes my amendment to prevent homeless youth and young mothers from seeing a lapse in service from their runaway youth programs and maternity group homes.                              {time}  1700  Specifically, this amendment allows HHS to offer transitional living programs and maternity group home grants for centers that would otherwise see a lapse in funding in fiscal year 2018.  This amendment does not increase funding for the program. This amendment simply prevents centers from facing a gap in grant eligibility due to a fiscal year which commenced off cycle. Failure to act will cause runaway and homeless youth and maternity group home centers across the county to downgrade, discontinue, or eventually close.  These important centers provide a temporary shelter to youth in crisis who are experiencing homelessness. These centers teach life skills and provide counseling and transitional services to homeless, pregnant, and parenting youth to promote long-term economic independence to ensure their well-being.  This issue was first brought to my attention by the Modesto Center for Human Services, which supports individuals and families in Stanislaus County, The Modesto center provides youth services, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, family resource centers, shelter services, and community projects. The center relies on an existing Transitional Living Program grant. The TLP grants are critical to helping homeless youth find employment and transition back into the community.  Unfortunately, the Modesto center and more than 100 other centers and shelters across the country are in jeopardy of losing eligibility for funding due to circumstances outside of their control. These grants account for a significant portion of their annual budgets, and a gap of this length will drastically reduce the services or force programs to shut down completely.  My amendment implores the administration to authorize bridge funding to close this gap in grant eligibility, allowing services to continue until the grant is realigned with the appropriations process. For the area I represent, losing these grants would have much wider ramifications for the overall homeless population and collaborative efforts to improve homeless care and services.  TLP and MGH grants help break the crippling cycle of homelessness. I call on my colleagues to support this amendment and allow homeless youth and parenting young people access to life-changing services.

34,topic-id,1677,"Mr.President, it was 1 week ago when President Trump and Attorney General Sessions announced that they were going to rescind the DACA This is a program created by President Obama by Executive order that allowed those who had come to the United States as children to have an opportunity to be given 2 years on a renewable basis where they would not be subject to deportation and could work.  These young people are known as the Dreamers, a term that came about when I introduced the bill 16 years ago called the DREAM These are young people who, frankly, are just asking for a chance, an opportunity to be part of the only country they have ever known.  The laws of the United States are very tough and very strict, and they say that, if you are undocumented, in their situation, you have to leave America for 10 years and then petition to come back in. That is why I introduced the DREAM So these young people who were brought to this country by their parents would have a chance.  President Obama used his authority in an Executive order to allow them to apply for DACA protection. They had to pay a substantial filing fee and submit themselves to a criminal background check before they would be allowed to stay. So 780,000 young people did just that, and they are protected currently, but only for a few more months, under this DACA provision.  What is going to happen to them, we don't know. The only thing that makes any sense at this point is for Congress to act, for us to do something to replace the DACA Program, which the President is going to rescind, with a law--a law that establishes clearly the requirements, as well as the rights, that will be given to these individuals under the law.  That is why I have introduced the Dream Act with my cosponsor Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South There are three other Republican cosponsors at this point, and we hope to move this forward.  President Trump has said he is interested in working with us, and we are going to take him at his word. Despite rescinding DACA, I hope the President will be on our side to come up with a replacement that is fair.  Also, I want to address many of the myths that have come up about DACA, as well as the Dream I am going to quote an unusual source for this The source is a man named David David is an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Those of us who live in this Washington environment of politics know that the Cato Institute is not a liberal think tank. It is the opposite. It is a conservative, largely Republican think tank, and Mr.Bier has published an article that has been seen in the Washington Post, in the Chicago Tribune, and in other papers entitled the ``Five myths about DACA.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post article entitled ``Five myths about DACA.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, 7, 2017]                         Five Myths About DACA                            (By David Bier)       The Trump administration's move to rescind the Deferred      Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, has created      an uncertain future for the 800,000 young unauthorized      immigrants who had been granted protection from deportation      and permission to work legally. A six-month delay provides a      chance for Congress to save the 2012 program. But if we're      going to debate the merits of DACA, we should know what we're      talking about. Here are some common myths.                               Myth 1       DACA incentivized an increase in illegal immigration. House      Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is among      those who support ending DACA because it has ``encouraged      more illegal immigration and contributed to the surge of      unaccompanied minors and families seeking to enter the U.     illegally.'' Statements like this betray a misunderstanding      of who is eligible for deportation relief under the program.      DACA applies only to immigrants who entered before their 16th      birthdays and who have lived in the country continuously      since at least June 15, 2007--more than a decade ago. No one      entering now can apply.       Perhaps the chairman thinks that children coming to the      border are confused on this point. But the facts don't      support that view either. To begin with, the timing is wrong.      According to data from the Border Patrol, the increase in      migrant children in 2012--the year President Barack Obama      announced DACA--occurred entirely in the months before the      president announced the policy. The rate of increase also      remained the same in 2013 as it was in 2012. Even then, the      total number of juveniles attempting to cross the border--     unaccompanied and otherwise--never returned to the pre-     recession levels of the mid-2000s.       Another problem with the theory is that although the      majority of DACA beneficiaries are of Mexican origin, the      increase in children crossing the border stems from El      Salvador, Guatemala and These countries share one      common trait: much higher than average levels of violence      than anywhere else in North A careful study of this      phenomenon by economist Michael Clemens found that more than      anything else, a rise in homicides between 2007 and 2009 set      off a chain of events that led to the rise of child      migration.       Regardless, overall illegal immigration is far below where      it was before the United States' last legalization program,      in 1986, when each border agent caught more than 40 border      crossers per month. Last year, it was fewer than two per      month. DACA had no effect on this trend.                               MYTH 2       DACA has taken jobs from In announcing the Trump      administration's decision this past week, Attorney General      Jeff[[Page S5193]]     Sessions said that DACA ``denied jobs to hundreds of      thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to      illegal aliens.'' This myth even has a name in economics: the      lump of labor fallacy. It supposes that the number of jobs in      the economy is fixed, and that any increase in workers      results in unemployment. Yet this notion is easily disproved.      From 1970 to 2017, the U.labor force doubled. Rather than      ending up with a 50 percent unemployment rate, U.     employment doubled.       If adding workers made the economy poorer, we might expect      that people would try to ``free'' themselves from competition      by moving to a desolate mountain and making everything for      themselves. That no one does so is an admission that      competition is actually good. We depend on other workers,      DACA recipients included, to buy the products and services we      produce. That's one reason earlier efforts to restrict      immigration did not produce any wage gains.                               MYTH 3       Repealing DACA would benefit taxpayers. Sessions also      argued that ending DACA ``protects taxpayers.'' But the      opposite is true. According to the National Academy of      Sciences (NAS), first-generation immigrants who enter the      United States as children (including all DACA recipients)      pay, on average, more in taxes over their lifetimes than they      receive in benefits, regardless of their education level.      DACA recipients end up contributing more than the average,      because they are not eligible for any federal means-tested      welfare: cash assistance, food stamps, Medicaid, health-care      tax credits or anything else.       They also are better educated than the average immigrant.      Applicants must have at least a high school degree to enter      the program. An additional 36 percent of DACA recipients who      are older than 25 have a bachelor's degree, and an additional      32 percent are pursuing a bachelor's degree. The NAS finds      that among recent immigrants who entered as children, those      with a high school degree are positive to the government, to      the tune of $60,000 to $153,000 in net present value, meaning      it's like each immigrant cutting a check for that amount at      the door. For those with a bachelor's degree, it's a net      positive of $160,000 to $316,000. Each DACA permit canceled      is like burning tens of thousands of dollars in                               MYTH 4       DACA repeal protects communities from criminals. DACA      repeal, the attorney general further claimed, ``saves lives''      and ``protects communities.'' He implied that DACA ``put our      nation at risk of crime.'' But DACA participants are not      criminals. Unauthorized immigrants--the applicant pool for      DACA--are much less likely to end up in prison, indicating      lower levels of criminality. More important, to participate      in DACA, applicants must pass a background check. They have      to live here without committing a serious offense. If they      are arrested, DACA can be taken away even without a      conviction.       Only 2,139 out of almost 800,000 DACA recipients have lost      their permits because of criminal or public safety concerns--     that's just a quarter of 1 percent. Four times as many U.S.-     born Americans are in prison. About 35 times as many      Americans have ended up behind bars at some point before age      34.                               MYTH 5       DACA repeal is just about politics. Obama criticized the      DACA move this past week as ``a political decision'' that was      ``not required legally.'' But legal issues certainly factored      into the Trump administration's calculation. The timing      coincided with a deadline that several states imposed on the      administration, stating that if the president did not wind      down DACA by 5, they would sue. If President Trump      wanted to end DACA for political reasons, he could have done      so on his first day in office.       Obama should know that defending DACA legally could be      difficult. After all, when he attempted to implement a      similar but much broader program in 2015 for undocumented      parents of U.citizens, courts shut him down. Obama      implemented DACA without going through Congress, and although      some legal scholars dispute whether it faces the same legal      issues as the 2015 program, the Trump administration would      have confronted a real possibility of defeat had it chosen to      defend DACA in court.       The correct response, however--for economic reasons and      security reasons, but above all for moral reasons--would have      been to actively push for Congress to enact the program, not      to announce its demise and leave the chips to fall where they      may.

35,topic-id,1819,"Mr.President, in this article, he spells out in some detail why some of the myths that were perpetrated by Attorney General Sessions and others last week need to be explained. One of them is that DACA somehow incentivized an increase in illegal immigration. Mr.Bier makes it clear that, when it comes down to it, you cannot arrive in the United States today and expect to be protected by DACA tomorrow. In fact, you have to have arrived in the United States at least by June 15 of 2007, more than a decade ago. So to argue that DACA was an incentive for more immigration in this country is just plain wrong.  What about those kids who showed up on the borders years ago, thousands of them? Well, it turns out that they weren't eligible for DACA or the Dream Act, and it also turns out that most of them were not from Mexico but from parts of Central America, which has been devastated by crime waves and gang activity.  The second myth that Mr.Bier addresses is that these DACA recipients--780,000--are taking jobs away from What he points out is that, if you start with the premise that we have a static amount of jobs in this country--what he calls a ``lump of labor fallacy''--then, it is dog-eat-dog to fight for those jobs.  It turns out that we have an expanding economy, and he proves it by giving us a statistic. Between 1970 and 2017, the U.labor force doubled. So rather than ending up with a 50-percent unemployment rate, our U.employment doubled. It is an expanding and dynamic economy.  The case can be made effectively that the DACA recipients are people who can add to the economy. All of them have to have the equivalent or a high school education. Many of them--large percentages of them--have college degrees and even more. So they can bring a lot to the economy.  The other point or the other myth that Mr.Bier addresses is whether repealing DACA would benefit taxpayers. The point he makes is that these DACA recipients are paying taxes in the jobs they are working and, by and large, are ineligible for any Federal programs or any Federal assistance.  So they are a net gain in terms of our Treasury and in terms of what they can do. For example, if you are protected by DACA today on a 2-year renewable basis, you do not qualify for a Pell grant to go to college. You don't qualify for a Federal Government loan. You have to find out how you are going to do it some other way. So these young people who are working and paying taxes are not drawing from any of the government programs that other people their age draw from.  There is also this argument that DACA somehow is going to make America less safe and that there will be more criminals. Don't forget what I said earlier. To qualify for DACA, you have to submit yourself to a criminal background check. The likelihood of the next crime being committed by a DACA recipient is very narrow. The likelihood that it is committed by someone who is already an American citizen is much more likely.  Finally, there is the argument that DACA is just about politics. Well, it can be about politics, unless we do our job in We are supposed to pass the laws. The President has challenged us to pass a law that will help deal with We have, I think, an awesome responsibility to do just that.  I was at Loyola University's medical school on Friday and met several of the DACA students who are in medical school at They are extraordinarily bright individuals who competed and were accepted at Loyola's medical school. Now they have a program. As they complete the 4 years of medical school at Loyola, they want to apply for residencies so they can specialize. If you are going to be a resident, you had better be prepared to work. If you don't have DACA protection, you can't legally work in the United Thirty-two aspiring, really bright, young medical students soon to be doctors will be stopped in their tracks if we don't replace DACA because they cannot apply for residency because they cannot legally work in America without DACA protection or something like it.  Would we be better off in America if those 32 individuals did not become doctors? Of course not. We want them to become doctors. In Illinois, the State is helping to pay for their education with the promise that they will practice medicine in an underserved area of our I am from downstate Illinois, small-town Illinois, and I will tell you that we desperately need more doctors, not just in individual towns but at the hospitals that serve those towns. If these 32 can help us reach those goals, we are going to have better medical care across our State, but that depends on Congress and Congress meeting its responsibility.  I have come to the floor of the Senate over 100 times now to tell the stories of individuals who are affected by[[Page S5194]]DACA and the Dream Act, and I want to do that again today. I found that speeches are great and statistics are fine, but when you hear the stories about these individuals--who they are, what they have done, and what they aspire to do--you can understand the context of this important national debate.  The person I want to introduce today in the Senate is this young lady, Cristina She was brought to the United States at the age of 6 from Caracas, She went to elementary school in Madison, She wrote me a letter. Cristina wrote the following:       I spent my formative childhood years in the Midwest where I      learned to assimilate and learned the values this country was      founded on. The salt-of-the-Earth quality of people around me      and extraordinary kindness between strangers shaped my own      values and attitude toward others. Growing up in Madison      taught me a great deal about compassion, patience, and hard      work.  Cristina was an outstanding student. In high school she was a member of the National Honor She was elected vice president of her class, and she managed the track team. She found time to volunteer at a local summer camp for pre-K students. She graduated from the Honors College at Miami Dade She is currently a student at Georgetown University, majoring in international law, institutions, and ethics. She has received the President's Volunteer Service Award 2 years in a row and is a Walsh As a graduate of Georgetown, I can tell you nobody ever named me a Walsh This young lady obviously is very talented.  During her time at Georgetown, Cristina has interned in the House of Representatives and has piloted a college mentorship program at a local high school. In addition, she also has found time to have two part-time jobs. She has to. You see, as a person who is protected by DACA and undocumented, she doesn't qualify for government assistance to go to college--certainly not at the Federal level. So these students have to work extra hard to stay in school.  She has dedicated two of her undergraduate summers and a full school year volunteering to teach in Miami and in San In both of these cities, she worked with high-achieving, low-income students trying to get them into college. You see, Cristina's dream ultimately is to be a teacher.  Last week in my office, Cristina joined 15 other students from Georgetown who came in as we were debating DACA and the Dream Act on the floor. I am sure they wanted to hear my speech on the floor but, just to make sure, we bought a dozen pizzas and the crew seemed to be pretty happy with that decision. It was an impressive group of students. Every one of them was a DACA recipient.  These young people have so much potential, but they are worried. They don't know what their future will be with the decision made last week by the Trump administration to repeal Congress hasn't acted to pass the Dream Act, and we should.  As for Cristina Velasquez, she will graduate from Georgetown in She has been accepted into Teach for Most of us know that organization well, but for the record, it is a national nonprofit organization that places the most talented recent college graduates in challenging school districts in urban and rural areas where they have a shortage of teachers. Teach for America has 190 teachers working in these challenging districts who are currently DACA They are teaching kids all across  What does it say about us? What does it say to their students if these Teach for America Dreamers are invited to leave the country? That is exactly what Mr.Steve Bannon said on 60 Minutes on Sunday when he came out against our efforts to pass the Dream He wants Cristina Velasquez gone. He thinks America is a better place if she is gone. I think he is wrong, and I think most reasonable people would agree.  Cristina is going to start the program, Teach for America, next summer and teach next fall, but without DACA or the Dream Act, Cristina and 190 other Teach for America teachers will be forced to drop out and leave their students behind.  Instead, many would have them deported back to countries they have never known, saying they are not part of the United States and they don't have anything to offer us. Will America be a stronger country if we deport Cristina or if she stays here to teach children in challenging districts? I think the answer is clear to any reasonable person.  When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Lindsey Graham and I--a Republican of South Carolina and a Democrat of Illinois--cosponsored the measure. We gave a press conference. Senator Graham said: The moment of reckoning is coming. Well, that moment has arrived.  Republican leaders in Congress need to help us to pass the Dream Act once and for all and make it the law of the land. We need to bear responsibility for these hundreds of thousands who can make America a better country. They show with their lives that the promise of America is still very much alive.  As for this Senator, I have been at this for a long time. I am going to see it to the finish line. I still have that dream of the day when President Trump signs the Dream Act into law in the Oval It will be a great day, particularly for this country to recognize that these young people offer special talents and a special commitment to the future of America, which we desperately need.

830,topic-id,2752,"Mr.President, when we finish this period of morning business, which is open to speeches and statements on many different topics, we will then go to the Defense authorization bill. Our process in the Senate is to authorize spending and then to appropriate the money for the actual spending. Occasionally, those two things are in sync, but many times they are not. I am afraid that what we face today is uncertainty.  Senator McCain, who is the chairman of the defense authorization committee, will bring his proposal to the floor, but it is at a spending level that is not allowed by current law. The Budget Control Act will not allow Senator McCain or the Senate to spend at[[Page S5087]]the level at which he wants to spend. I can make a good argument that the statutory level we are required to hold to is inadequate to our national defense. If we are honest about taking care of the problem, we not only have to pass this authorization bill, but we have to change the Budget Control Act so that we can put more money into our national defense. That debate will get started this week. It is near and dear to Senator McCain's heart. He works hard on it each year with Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode  There will be many amendments considered, I am sure, during the course of this week on Defense authorization.                                  DACA  Mr.President, what I come to the floor to speak to as in morning business is not that issue; it is the issue of DACA and the It was just 6 days ago that the announcement was made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he was going to rescind the DACA  A quick history. Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM The DREAM Act was written to take care of young people who, by their parents, were brought to the United States as infants and toddlers and young boys and girls and who grew up in this country. They did not get into trouble with the law. They finished school and always thought that they were going to be Americans and that they would use their education and their skills to build lives in this country. However, because their parents either came here undocumented or did not file the appropriate papers, these young people are literally without a country. The country they grew up in does not accept them under the law. So 16 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act and said: Let's take care of this problem. These young people, as it was through no fault of their own, should be given a chance to stay in this country and be part of its future.  I passed it in the Senate, and I have seen it passed in the We have never quite been able to bring it together in any one year and have it pass both Chambers, so it is not the law of the land. Sixteen years ago, I introduced it, and it is still not the law of the land.  In the meantime, Senator Obama, my colleague in the Senate, cosponsored the DREAM Act and then got a promotion. As President of the United States, I asked him: Can you do something to protect these young people from being deported?  He said that he would, so by Executive order, he created something known as DACA, the DACA Program, by which young people come forward, turn themselves in, register with the United States, pay a filing fee to cover all of the costs of the process, and go through a criminal background check. If they are approved and cleared, for 2 years, they can stay in the United States without having the fear of being deported, and they are allowed to work. Then, 2 years later, it is renewable. Over the years President Obama had done that, 780,000 young people signed up, went through the background check, and were approved under  Last week, President Trump, through his Attorney General, announced that he was going to rescind the DACA So the 780,000 young people have their futures in doubt. They do not know which way they are going to turn. This creates serious problems, as you might imagine. The young people who are affected by it are affected emotionally--I would be, too--because they do not know what is going to happen next. They do not know whether they are going to be allowed to stay in this country, whether they will be deported from this country, or whether they will be able to work legally. They are waiting for Congress to give the answer, and the President says he is waiting for Congress to give the answer.  Last Friday, I went back to Chicago, which I am honored to represent in the Senate, and I visited Loyola University's School of It is known as the Stritch School of  At the outset, let me say how proud I am to represent the city and especially to represent Loyola  Here is what they did in their medical school when President Obama created They said: We will open up competition for our medical school to include those who are protected by We will not give them special slots, and we will not give them a quota. They can compete with everybody else who wants to go to our medical school.  Do you know what happened? At the end of the day, 32 of those DACA applicants scored so high that they were accepted at Loyola's Stritch School of They are now in 2 or 3 different years of classes. It is amazing. Many of them, from all over the United States, grew up without having legal citizenship status and always dreamed of being doctors, but it was impossible. They knew that no medical school would accept them. And Loyola said: We will accept you, and they got their chance--32 of them.  There is more to the story, as these young people do not qualify for any government assistance from the Federal Because they are undocumented, they do not qualify for Pell grants, and they do not qualify for Federal Government loans. Medical school is expensive. How are they going to do it? They worked their way through college, paying out of their own pockets. How are they going to pay for medical school? Our State, the State of Illinois, under Governor Pat Quinn and renewed under Governor Rauner, created a loan program for them from which they could borrow money from the But there was a catch: For every year they borrowed money to go to medical school at Loyola, they had to pledge that they would give 1 year of service, of their lives, as doctors in underserved communities in our They did it. Thirty-two of them signed up for it. I am very proud to say that the program has been a terrific success in our They are just extraordinary, along with the other students at the medical school.  They are special people. They come from all over the world, and they are all in this similar predicament, but until last week, they were protected by What happens when you take away the DACA Executive order, which President Trump said he will do over the next 6 months? There is a special challenge here. After they finish 4 years of medical school, these students apply for residencies, whereby they pursue their specialties, whatever they might be. A residency is work experience for all of these medical students. Through some university, they will be working as residents at hospitals, working long hours while pursuing their dreams of being doctors and specialists.  Here is the problem: With DACA's being gone, they no longer have the legal right to work in the United What does that mean? They cannot apply for residencies. This is the end of it, the end of their medical education. It stops right there. Whatever their ambitions might be, whether it is surgery or psychiatry, they cannot go forward without  It really puts a burden on us in Congress to decide what we are going to do, doesn't it? Are we going to pass a law that finally, once and for all, defines the legal status of these young people--not just for these medical students but for hundreds of thousands of others who are working? They are engineers. They are teachers. They are working in so many different areas, and they want to continue being part of this country.  I am encouraged that we have a bipartisan response. My colleague Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is my lead cosponsor on this year's version of the Dream We currently have three other Republican Senators who have joined as cosponsors from across the United States--Senator Murkowski from Alaska, Senator Flake from Arizona, and Senator Gardner from We hope others will join them. If we get the critical 60 votes in the Senate--60 sponsors or 60 who will pledge to vote for it--we can pass the Dream Act once and for all and take care of the concerns of the medical students I mentioned and so many others across this country.  I have come to the floor over the last few years and told the stories of the I think these stories have created good impressions in people's minds about who these young people are and what they can do for the future of the United I would like to do that again today.  This is Harminder Harminder was 6 years old when his family moved[[Page S5088]]to the United States from He grew up in Queens in New York He was a typical American kid--played sports and went to the park every day. Harminder's dream was to serve his country as a soldier in the U.In his words, he simply wanted to give back.  Harminder was a born leader, and in high school, he was active in student government and was ultimately elected class president. He first learned that he did not have legal immigration status when he was in high school and he could not get a driver's license. They explained to him that he did not have the necessary legal documentation to be in this country. He was brought here as a kid and is growing up. He is now a student at Hunter College at the City University of New York and is working toward his bachelor's degree in history.  Thanks to DACA, he is fulfilling his dream. Last year, he was able to enlist in the Army through the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest Program, known as This photo is from his enlistment ceremony.  The MAVNI Program allows immigrants with skills that are vital to our national interests to enlist in the Armed More than 800 DACA recipients with these skills--the people whom I described earlier--have joined America's military. They really want to be part of our country.  Now, some Trump administration officials claim that DACA recipients are taking away jobs from But Harminder and hundreds just like him have skills that our military couldn't find in the general population they were recruiting from. Harminder, along with many other Dreamers, is now waiting to ship out for basic training. He continues his undergraduate studies and is working full time while waiting for a chance to volunteer to serve America in the military.  Harminder said:       All I want to do is serve. I want to do my part to give      back to this country because it allowed me to serve.  Harminder and other Dreamers have so much to give to America, but without DACA--without the Dream Act--Harminder and hundreds of other immigrants with skills that are really important to our national interests will have to leave the They want nothing more than to serve our country. They are prepared to die for our country. What more can we ask?  But, instead, there are those who would say that they should leave, that they should be deported. One of the President's former staff advisers, in a ``60 Minutes'' show last night, said those exact words: They should just leave.  I don't think America would be a stronger country if Harminder left. I don't think our military would be stronger without his contribution and service to our country. He should be part of America, and we can do something about it.  A friend of mine recently went to the University of Notre Dame to visit with the administration there--represented by the Presiding Officer--in the State of It is my understanding that they have some 68 DACA recipients at Notre Dame There is hardly a university in this country that doesn't have DACA-eligible young people who are going to school there. Remember, they don't qualify for any Federal assistance for education, at all, because they are in an undocumented status, but they are working their way through. They are borrowing the money. They are working jobs to make sure that they reach a point where they have a future.  Now it is up to us. We have to decide what we are going to do. Senator Graham, my cosponsor of the Dream Act, said a week or so ago, when we introduced the bill, that the moment of reckoning is coming. That moment is not only coming. It arrived last  We need Republican leaders to join us to help make the Dream Act the law of the land. Otherwise, what will happen to these young people?  As for this Senator, I have made this a major part of my public career. I feel a special kinship with these young people. Yesterday was Mexican Independence Day in What a parade there was. It must have gone on for 2 miles. It felt like it. There were more people than you could imagine coming out with their families--people of Mexican heritage who are now part of Chicago, part of Illinois, and part of the United As I was marching down the street, there was a young lady and a couple of her friends walking next to me wearing princess crowns, and I started talking to them. It turned out that two of the young girls were born in the United The third was born in Mexico, and she is a DACA recipient. She is going to school. She thanked me for the DACA Program and said: I hope you can make it a reality again.  We have that obligation. We have that responsibility. We need to step up with this broken immigration system and make certain that, at the end of the day, we have done everything in our power to give these young people like Harminder and hundreds of thousands just like him a chance to be part of America's future.                        Remembering September 11  Mr.President, let me just close with a brief statement. I listened to my colleague and friend Senator Schumer speak in very touching terms about this anniversary which we observe today--the 16th anniversary of 9/11. I can recount where I was and what I remember, as I have before on the floor, but I will not. I will just say that it changed America in so many different ways.  As I went through airport security this morning at O'Hare, which I do every single week. I thought to myself that 16 years ago it would have been unthinkable that we would put passengers--every single one of them--through this kind of security process. But that is the reality of life in a world that is dangerous, life in a world where we want to protect innocent people from the 9/11s of the future that are being plotted and planned by our enemies around the world.  I think of those whose lives were lost on 9/11. I think of those who risked their lives. I think of those whose lives will never be the same because of that day.  It is a reminder to all of us to thank God that we live in this great country, to remember our history well, to honor the men and women in the military, and the men and women in law enforcement and in medicine, who stepped up that day in a heroic way, and to make sure that we do everything in our generation so that no future generation has a similar experience.

315,topic-id,527,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is very simple. If you have a contract doing business with the Federal Government, if in your disclosures you have been found designated to have violations of the Federal Labor Relations Act, and those violations are considered to be willful, intentional, and repeated, then you will not be able to take advantage of this particular appropriation.  This kind of amendment is designed to say that the Federal Government believes that a penny earned and a penny worked should be received by the worker. It is as simple as that.  People who do not support this amendment are saying that Federal contractors can engage in wage theft and it is okay with us. And we are simply saying that the hardworking people in the United States expect that the Federal penny that workers earn will be given to them, and that is not too much to ask.  Hardworking people living in America should never worry that an employer will steal their wages, especially if that employer is paid by a government contract. Right now, Federal contractors who repeatedly and intentionally pay subminimum wage, force[[Page H7308]]their workers to work off the clock, refuse to pay overtime, or make illegal deductions on their employees' pay are still allowed to apply for Federal contracts. They should not be. We should reward workers who treat their workers fairly and not allow firms who willfully and repeatedly profiteer off of their employees by letting them keep their government contracts.  If passed, my amendment will ensure that a business that willfully and repeatedly violates the Fair Labor Standards Act cannot apply for a Federal Government contract until they clean up their act. To be clear, my amendment would not punish a single accidental violation.  If my colleagues across the aisle won't make corporations pay their fair share of their taxes, I hope that they will at least join me in going after employers who refuse to pay taxpayer money to line their pockets by cheating employees repeatedly, and on purpose. This is not a small thing. This is real money out of real people's pockets.  The Economic Policy Institute found that low-wage workers in just the ten most popular States--California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, and others--lose $8 billion in wages due to wage theft each year.  For example, the corporation General Dynamics Information Technology owns a number of call centers that serve Federal contracts. In the last 10 years, they have agreed to pay $412,000 in back wages to 921 employees for Fair Labor Standards Act violations. Immigrants and residents of low-income communities are often at the greatest risk for abuse at the hands of employers who do wage theft.  The government should be doing everything it can to protect workers from intimidation and stolen wages. If this amendment passes, companies like General Dynamics Information Technology won't be able to continue to do what they have been doing. They will have to be fair to people, at least after they clean up their act.  We have to demand higher standards, Mr.Respecting a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is an American value.

This association became known as the Buffalo Bill Center of the West on February 8, 2013, and has since performed the task of preserving the great legacy and historical significance of Buffalo Bill He came to symbolize the American West and lived the tale like no other as an explorer, frontiersman, soldier, scout, actor, entrepreneur, and civic leader.  In 1867, Cody received his nickname of ``Buffalo Bill'' as he hunted buffalo for the Kansas Pacific Railroad, where he became known as an expert shot. He soon became a civilian scout for the U.Army, and in that capacity, he was awarded the U.S Congressional Medal of In 1883, Cody created Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, in which he gained fame and notoriety for the show's dramatic recreations of life on the frontier.

Mr.Speaker, as I was walking up to the Capitol from the Metro station just a few minutes ago, I remembered just a couple weeks ago I was boarding up my house and preparing for Hurricane Those intervening weeks have just altered my life immeasurably, seeing the devastation that has been wrought on south  The district I represent, Corpus Christi, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Refugio, those southern coastal areas were damaged severely by wind. But then you move up the Texas coast into towns like Victoria, Wharton, Houston, and then there was just unimaginable damage by water.  I was touched by how the entire Nation reached out to help, sending food, water, help, and volunteers. And as I was walking up today, it is a beautiful, crisp beginning to be a fall day here in Washington, D.C., but I am imagining what those folks in Florida are going through, very similar to what I was going through, searching for the elusive D cell battery for a flashlight, trying to find a gasoline station that is open, and preparing for possibly the worst.  We are here today to tell those folks in Florida, those folks in Texas, and those who face disasters all over this country that this Congress has your back.  President Trump and Vice President Pence both visited the district I represent and areas north in Houston, showing that the Federal Government is there; but it is this Congress' constitutional responsibility to control the purse strings of the country, and we have got to make sure that there is money for these essential disaster relief services.  There is only so much our volunteers can do, there is only so much our State and local governments can do, because this is just so massive, it is beyond the ability of individuals to comprehend. The amount of debris, the amount of damage, the potential for disease all make it a Federal problem. It is a problem for our country.  The storm shut down some of the refineries along Texas, and I think we have all seen the higher gasoline prices that have resulted from that.  Florida is threatened, their impact on our national economy. We are one national economy. What hurts one of us hurts us all.  So I am here to say thank you to the American people, who opened their hearts with their donations and their volunteering, but I am also here to thank the American people, who are going to allocate a few of their tax dollars to help those in need in Texas and, I am afraid, those who are going to be in need very soon in  I am encouraging my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this.

As we take this week to somberly remember those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, it is equally important that we remember the first responders who bravely ran towards the tragedy of 16 years ago, who woke up the next day, on September 12, 2001, still beaten, tired, and bruised but, again, walked towards those tragedies. Still, today, these first responders heroically risk life and limb to run toward tragedies.  As Americans, we owe our first responders a great debt.

41,topic-id,968,"Mr.President, today I wish to congratulate this body on its passage of two important antitrafficking bills: the Abolish Human Trafficking Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection  I am proud to have worked with Senators Grassley, Cornyn, and Klobuchar on these comprehensive bills and commend them and their staffs for the thoughtful and bipartisan manner in which they were drafted.  I would also like to thank the numerous law enforcement and antitrafficking organizations and, most importantly, the survivors, who have provided feedback and support throughout this process. It is my hope that the legislation passed last night will assist the tremendous work these groups do in the fight against human trafficking.  Both bills reauthorize a number of important programs that help victims and strengthen efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to human trafficking crimes.  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which I authored with Senator Grassley, promotes victim-centered training for school resource officers, judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement. It ensures that trafficking victims are properly screened and that more comprehensive data about trafficking crimes are collected.  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act also includes one of my top priorities, which is to prevent the proliferation of trafficking offenses over the internet. I want to take a moment to discuss why I believe this to be a deeply important step in curtailing the criminal enterprise of trafficking.  The commercial sex industry is evolving. The use of the internet to sell commercial sex has escalated dramatically over the past several years.  Online platforms have provided an easily accessible and seemingly low-risk forum for buyers. In 2014, one website advertised nearly 12,000 advertisements for commercial sex in a single day.  Some of these sites have become hubs of human trafficking. Backpage.com, in particular, has been used to facilitate sex trafficking of minors for years. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has determined that Backpage.com is linked to 73 percent of all suspected child sex trafficking reports that it receives through its ``CyberTipline.''  Indeed, just a few months ago in my home State, a 3-month investigation into Backpage.com led the Stockton Police Department to discover eight victims being trafficked for sex in the area. Some of these girls were as young as 14 years old. San Joaquin District Attorney's Human Trafficking Task Force said that advertisements on Backpage com offered sexual acts with the victims for as little as $20.  Under current law, it is a criminal offense to knowingly advertise commercial sex acts with a minor. Backpage.com has repeatedly asserted that it has no involvement with the advertisements posted on its website. However, after a thorough review of Backpage.com's screening methods and practices regarding their advertisements, the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations concluded that Backpage.com knows that its website facilitates trafficking and knowingly concealed evidence of criminality by systematically editing its adult ads to help them avoid detection by law enforcement.  Shortly after these findings were publicly released, the Washington Post obtained documents that showed that contractors hired by Backpage.com were specifically instructed to solicit and create sex ads aggressively, including the posting of ads suggestive of sex with minors. In fact, these documents revealed that ``invoices and call sheets indicate Backpage.com was pushing [the contractor] to get as many new listings as possible.''  These revelations are deeply concerning, and I hope that they will be[[Page S5211]]thoroughly investigated. Those who knowingly advertise minors for commercial sex must be held accountable.  It is appalling that even as serious questions about Backpage.com's culpability are raised, law enforcement officers do not have all of the tools they need to prevent young children from being exploited on the site.  The language we have included in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act will prevent the continued victimization of children by providing law enforcement with a tool to prevent traffickers from using online tools to further their exploitation.  Specifically, the provision adds civil injunction authority to the criminal statute that prohibits the advertisement of commercial sex acts with a minor. This allows the Department of Justice to file civil enforcement cases to prevent traffickers from using the internet and other tech platforms to sell children for sex.  Civil injunction authority is not new. It exists for the Attorney General to obtain orders against criminal defendants to stop them from committing certain kinds of crimes. For example, such authority has been used by the Department to shut down websites from distributing software for spying on people.  Adding this authority to existing criminal trafficking provisions gives law enforcement a more readily accessible means to deny human traffickers access to platforms like Backpage.com and thereby restrict their ability to traffic children online.  I am similarly proud to have cosponsored the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, which was led by Senators Cornyn and The bill includes critical provisions to aid victims in restoring their lives. It extends the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which helps fund victim services and increase law enforcement efforts. It also expands mandatory restitution provisions for sex tourism and other trafficking-related crimes.  The bill further strengthens law enforcement's ability to prevent and prosecute trafficking offenses For example, the Abolish Human Trafficking Act expands the authority of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to use wiretaps in sexual exploitation cases. It also enhances statutory maximum penalties for several human trafficking offenses and establishes a human trafficking coordinator at every U.Attorney's  As the sex trafficking industry continues to evolve, so must our laws. We must ensure that we are doing all we can to curtail this criminal enterprise and do right by those who have been victimized. The bills we have passed last night aim to do just that. Again, I congratulate my colleagues on the passage of this important, comprehensive legislation. I hope that ending the scourge of human trafficking will continue to be a top priority for this body.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgS5210-5.txt,1332,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017.0,12.0,September

834,topic-id,2219,"Madam President, 16 years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation unites once again to honor the Americans killed on that horrific day. Our minds are filled with the haunting images of the burning towers, the crumbling structure of the Pentagon, and the smoking field in That dark day drastically changed the course of our Nation, and we will always remember where we were when we first heard the news that our country was under attack.  But 9/11 did not change who we are or the values we hold so dear. Amid the heartbreak and devastation, our citizens showed abounding courage, kindness, and love of country. In New York City, Arlington, and the scarred field in Shanksville, American flags were placed atop the rubble as symbols of determination in the face of evil. We will always remember the innocent lives lost in the attacks, and we will forever be grateful for the brave first responders who ran toward danger to help those in need.  We should also remember the significant work of the men and women of the U.Strategic Command in Nebraska[[Page S5090]]during this national emergency. Today, I want to recognize and honor what happened at STRATCOM on 9/11.  On that fateful day, STRATCOM's staff at Offutt Air Force Base, along with military personnel at several other U.bases, woke up expecting to strategize a response to a major attack against the United Days earlier, they had begun Global Guardian, an annual training exercise performed by the U.Strategic Command, the Air Force Space Command, and The main purpose of the exercise was to test the military's command and control procedures in the event of nuclear warfare.  Leaders at STRATCOM learned during breakfast that a plane had struck the World Trade When the second plane hit shortly thereafter, they understood that this had not been an accident. America was under attack.  The Global Guardian's fictional exercise was quickly canceled, and the men and women of STRATCOM responded to the day's events happening in the real world. After the FAA ordered every plane in the United States to be grounded, STRATCOM monitored the landings of thousands of civilian aircraft. Using a screen on the wall of the command post, they worked to identify which planes had been hijacked, knowing that finding these dangerous needles in the haystack of America's commercial airline industry could be the difference between safety and catastrophe.  As the day unfolded, STRATCOM leadership received a 30-minute notice that the secure location the President would be using was going to be Offutt Air Force Nebraska was ready to protect the  Escorted by two F-15 fighters, Air Force One landed around 1:50 p.m. ADM Richard Mies, in charge of the Strategic Command at the time, picked up President Bush in his car and drove to STRATCOM's underground command post. STRATCOM staff quickly briefed the President and established a secure video link that allowed him to speak with the National Security Council and other senior officials. For 2 hours Nebraska served as the center of America's national defense before President Bush returned to Washington, and we did it well.  Nebraska is honored to host the U.Strategic Command Global Operations Center, and we are proud of the excellent work they did during the attacks of 9/11 to protect our country.  Year after year, this day is a reminder of tragedy and tears, but we should also recall the strength and resolve of the citizens of the greatest country on Though the threats to our way of life have and will continue to evolve, our enduring commitment to defending freedom will never waver.

Mr.Mr.President, I will address the Senate on the issue of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  The PRESIDING The Senator is recognized.  Mr.Mr.President, today, our Nation commemorates the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that took the lives of thousands of innocent We all join in solemn remembrance of the victims, and our hearts go out to their families.  September 11 is a fitting day for the Senate to begin the consideration of the Defense authorization bill. The anniversary of those horrific terrorist attacks should serve as a reminder of the reason brave, young Americans are currently deployed around the world, fighting on behalf of freedom. I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the meaning of this day throughout the consideration of this important legislation, which will provide our men and women in uniform the resources, equipment, and support they need to keep our Nation safe.  I would like to extend my appreciation to the majority leader for his willingness to move expeditiously to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 and for his leadership.  I would also like to thank the Armed Services Committee ranking member, the Senator from Rhode Island, for his hard work on the I remain appreciative of the thoughtfulness and bipartisan spirit with which he approaches national security issues.  The fact is, the NDAA is a piece of legislation in which this body--Members on both sides of the aisle--can and should take enormous pride. Not only does this legislation provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need and deserve, but it is a product of an open and bipartisan process that represents the best of the U. The Senate Armed Services Committee passed the fiscal year 2018 NDAA unanimously by a vote of 27 to 0. I repeat. The Defense authorization bill was passed by a unanimous vote of 27 to 0. That means all 14 Republican members and the 13 Democratic members of the committee voted in favor of this legislation. During the markup, the committee considered and adopted 277 amendments that were offered by both Republicans and  Now we hope to consider the legislation under an open amendment process on the floor, which will allow all Senators to have their voices heard. This process, which is exactly how legislation is supposed to make its way through the Senate, has become disappointingly rare. For too long, partisanship and politics have triumphed over principle and policy. This legislation is an opportunity for us to reverse that trend and restore regular order in the U. The need for this legislation is self-apparent to anyone who is paying attention to today's world. With global terrorist networks, increasing great power competition with Russia and China, malign Iranian influence that is spreading across the Middle East, a North Korean dictator who is racing to acquire missiles that can hit the United States with nuclear weapons, the threats to our national security have not been more complex or daunting than at any time in the past seven decades.  We must also remember that we are a nation at war, with brave young men and women who are deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the world. The NDAA is legislation that will deliver to our Armed Forces the resources, equipment, and training they need to meet the increasingly complex challenges of today's world, and it will begin the process of rebuilding our military after years of devastating defense cuts.  Let me point out what happens as a result of these mindless defense cuts, which every military leader has described as devastating to our ability to defend this Let me just remind you of the hard truth. The state of our military is eroding. We saw disturbing evidence of this reality over the summer as 42 servicemembers tragically perished in accidents during routine--I emphasize routine--training operations.  On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a containership off the coast of On July 10, a Marine KC-130 crashed in Mississippi and killed all 16 troops on board. On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near On August 25, an Army Black Hawk helicopter went missing during a training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died. Just last week in Nevada, two Air Force A-10 aircraft crashed into each other. Thank God the pilots were safely ejected, but the planes were lost--at a cost of over $100 million. For the two Pacific Fleet naval collisions, ship repairs are estimated to cost more than a half a billion dollars. The lives lost in each of these incidents were priceless.  Over the past 3 years, a total of 185 men and women in uniform have been killed in noncombat accidents. During the same time, 44 servicemembers were killed in combat. The bottom line is, we are killing more of our own people in training than our enemies are in combat, and that did not happen by accident. It is a problem that is caused by this mindless sequestration and a lack, frankly, of appreciation by Members of this body and the other one of what the needs are of the men and women who are serving. It is about time that we started listening to our[[Page S5091]]military leadership who are saying that if we do not change what we are doing in the next 5 years, our enemies--our adversaries--will catch up with us.  This legislation authorizes a base defense budget that, together with the administration's request of $8 billion for other defense activities, supports a total defense budget of $640 billion in funding for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of The legislation also authorizes $60 billion for overseas contingency operations. In total, the NDAA supports a national defense topline of $700 billion.  This funding is critical to begin addressing the readiness shortfall and modernization crisis caused by the self-inflicted wounds of the Budget Control Act, sequestration, and repeated continuing resolutions. We need look no further than recent headlines, as I mentioned, of fatal incidents during routine training operations for evidence of the deteriorated state of our military.  These ship collisions and aviation accidents are taking the lives of our servicemembers at an alarming rate. In fact, in the last 3 years, we have killed four times as many of our own soldiers in peacetime training operations than our enemies have in combat. While there is plenty of responsibility to go around, we cannot ignore Congress's role. Years of budget cuts have forced our military to try to do too much with too little.  Meanwhile, our adversaries are investing heavily in their own militaries, developing future warfare capabilities intended to erode our military advantage. Simply put, we cannot wait any longer to recapitalize our forces and restore our capabilities.  Another important aspect of the NDAA is that it builds on the reforms this Congress has passed in recent years. By continuing important efforts to reorganize the Department of Defense, spur innovation and defense technology, and improve defense acquisition and business operations, the NDAA seeks to strengthen accountability and streamline the process of getting our warfighters what they need to succeed. At the same time, it prioritizes accountability from the Department and demands the best use of every taxpayer dollar.  The NDAA will also improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and those who support them. The legislation authorizes a 2.1-percent pay raise for our troops. It improves military family readiness and supports the civilians and contractors who work together with our Armed Forces to achieve the mission.  Finally, the NDAA provides necessary assistance for our allies and partners around the world who are dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom, deterring the aggression of our adversaries, and defeating the scourge of terrorism.  These are the reasons why this legislation is more vital than ever. Congress's most important constitutional responsibility is providing for the common defense. Consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act each year is one of the ways that we live up to that duty.  I guess we are going to have cloture on this bill. We don't need it. We shouldn't have to have it. We should move immediately to this legislation. Those who want to impose blockades to moving forward, to allowing other Members to have their amendments proposed and voted on, are doing the men and women who are serving our Nation a great disservice. The world is in more turmoil than it has been in 70 years. We cannot waste precious time and effort because one Senator has one amendment and he or she is then willing to block the whole process. Let's not do that this year. We can get around it. But what it does is deprive other Members of their ability to debate and have votes on their issues.  So I hope my colleagues, once we vote for cloture, will agree to move forward with the bill. We can finish in the next couple of days, and we can give the American people and the men and women who defend this Nation a product we can be proud of.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

379,topic-id,887,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, as we gather this week and mark the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we remember the nearly 3,000 innocent people lost in that heinous act--including 18 from my home of Bucks County,  Additionally, we honor the more than 400 first responders who perished and the countless more whose long-term health was impacted because of their courageous action. Each of us in this Chamber has heard stories of those brave firefighters, police officers, and EMTs who ran toward the danger and chaos on that Tuesday morning and made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their community and their country. Today we remember them, and we recommit to recognize their efforts and those efforts of all first responders around our  Mr.Speaker, since 9/11, we have seen the devastating impact of coordinated terrorist attacks on civilian targets. In these cases, first responders--including local police, fire, and emergency medical personnel--are the main response force. It is critical that these men and women have the training and tools to operate in these planned attacks.  That is why I have introduced H.3284, the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series Act of 2017, to authorize a vital workshop series allowing State and local jurisdictions to prepare for coordinated terrorist attacks.  H.3284, as amended, authorizes the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series for 5 years and delineates the activities that are required to be part of each workshop, including a review of current plans, policies and procedures, and an examination of the roles and responsibilities of each participating agency.  H.3284 ensures that the whole community--from government officials, law enforcement, fire, EMS, and public health officials to the private sector--participates in the workshop.  Additionally, Mr.Speaker, this bill allows the FEMA Administrator to select jurisdictions to participate in such workshops from jurisdictions that currently receive, or previously received, Urban Area Security Initiative funding and have requested to host a workshop.  Finally, H.3284 requires the participants to develop a summary report after each workshop that includes the key findings and strategies to mitigate the identified gaps.  I introduced this bill with bipartisan support, and I am proud to have the backing of two first responder organizations that I trust when working on this type of legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the International Association of Fire Chiefs and a letter of support from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers                                         International Association                                               of Fire Chiefs,                                       Fairfax, VA, July 21, 2017.     Brian Fitzpatrick,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Fitzpatrick: On behalf of the nearly      12,000 fire and emergency service leaders of the      International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I express      our support for H.3284, your legislation to authorize the      Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series (JCTAWS).      These multidisciplinary exercises help local jurisdictions      prepare for the threat of complex, coordinated terrorist      attacks.       The terrorist threat continues to evolve. As terrorist      incidents in Mumbai in 2008, Paris in 2015, and Brussels in      2016 demonstrate, complex, coordinated terror attacks using      multiple teams and a variety of tactics are a growing threat      that local jurisdictions will have to address. Local      jurisdictions must be prepared to respond to multiple      incidents at the same time involving active shooter      incidents, explosives and the use of fire as a weapon.       The JCTAWS exercises provide an environment where local      fire service, law enforcement, emergency medical service,      private sector and other disciplines can plan for joint      response to these incidents. The JCTAWS allows federal, state      and local partners to collaboratively evaluate their options      and learn how to best protect their communities. The      exercises also bring together resources from the U.     Department of Homeland Security, the National      Counterterrorism Center, and the Federal Bureau of      Investigation to leverage the strengths of these major      agencies. After a jurisdiction hosts a JCTAWS exercise, key      findings are communicated to the participants as well as      mitigation strategies and resources to address gaps in      preparedness.       The IAFC endorses this legislation and thanks you for      authorizing funding for this critical exercise program. We      look forward[[Page H7231]]     to working with you to pass this legislation this year.

FLEOA is the non-partisan, not-for-profit      professional organization representing more than 26,000      federal officers and agents from over 65 agencies.       FLEOA President Nathan Catura stated, ``The horrific damage      and loss of life caused by terrorists 16 years ago reminds us      of the devastation into which first responders insert      themselves on a regular basis. Whenever state, local,      federal, and tribal first responders react as one unified      team, the public benefits in countless ways.''       ``As a former federal agent, Congressman Fitzpatrick knows      the benefits H.3284 will have by expanding the unified      training and communication of responders,'' Catura continued.      ``It is because of the previous JCTAWS training and the      additional training H.3284 will generate that the public      safety community has made considerable progress since the 9/     11 attacks.''

861,topic-id,734,"Mr.President, I wish to thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership on this issue. He has been at it a long time. The two of us have been at it for quite a while. I think this is the year. This is the time. We are well past time for an  I wish to thank the Senator from Kentucky for focusing the Senate's attention on the 16-year-old authorization for use of military force. As a freshman Member of the House of Representatives, I voted in favor of the 2001 authorization on September 14, 2001--almost 16 years ago to the day--September 14, 2001. I can attest that when I voted for that law, I had no idea it would still be in effect 16 years later.  Since its passage, more than 300 Members of the House who took that vote that day, on September 14, 2001--more than 300 Members of the House are no longer in office. Of the Senators who voted, only 23 remain in the Senate today--23 out of 100. That comes out to about 70 percent of the Congress who has not voted to authorize force against terrorist groups abroad.  It is long past time for Congress to calibrate the legal underpinning of the war against terrorism to today's realities. ISIS, for example, did not exist when the 2001 law was approved. We have learned a number of things since we voted to go to war with the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks, and I think it is time to incorporate those lessons into a new  For example, we have learned that no administration is ever going to want to have the powers granted to it under the 2001 law curtailed. The Obama administration fought efforts to put an ISIS-specific AUMF in place, and the Trump administration has signaled it believes the 2001 authorities are adequate, and it does not plan to seek a new  We have also learned that crafting a new AUMF that garners bipartisan support is an especially difficult task. I know, because we have been trying for a while.  I think we can all agree, the only thing worse than having the 2001 statute in place is a partisan vote on a new  Lastly, we have learned that America is strongest when we speak with one voice, which means Congress needs to have some buy-in. We have to have some skin in the game. Otherwise, we can simply blame the administration for any effort overseas.  We can't let wars against new terrorist groups like ISIS be waged only by the executive branch. We in Congress need to weigh in and we have to let our allies and our adversaries know we are serious and committed.  Taking these lessons into account, I think it is imperative for any future terrorism-related AUMF to include a sunset provision that requires Congress to put its skin in the game. That way, we can avoid being put in the position we are in today--having to vote on an amendment to repeal a law that authorizes force against groups that are actively planning attacks against American interests.  Ultimately, I cannot support my colleague's effort to repeal the 2001 AUMF in 6 months because of the very real risk associated with repealing such a vital law before we have something to replace it with. Fortunately, I know the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee remains committed to considering legislation to repeal the 2001 AUMF and to replace it.  As I mentioned, the Senator from Virginia and I have introduced legislation to do just that. That legislation, S.43, would repeal the 2001 law and authorize the use of force against al-Qaida, the Taliban, and It would allow for greater congressional oversight of what groups can be deemed as ``associated forces'' of those organizations. It also contains a sunset provision.  So I look forward to working with my colleague from Kentucky and other members of the Foreign Relations Committee to move an AUMF that can garner bipartisan support. That is the right way to do it--under regular order, moving it through the Foreign Relations Committee, and then bringing it here to the floor, where we can debate and we can have buy-in, and the Senate can vote on an AUMF and then the Then, the U.Government--the Congress and the executive branch--can speak with one voice.

139,topic-id,658,"Mr.Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that redirects $120 million from CMS overhead spending, which is a 3\1/2\ percent reduction, towards increasing funding in three specific areas: $40 million for pediatric research, $40 million for Alzheimer's research, and $40 million to address our country's opioid crisis.  The approval of this amendment will motivate CMS to modify its current punitive bureaucratic culture. Today, hardworking American families are demanding that their government find competent solutions for a struggling healthcare system, and CMS' failure to properly implement the Taking Essential Steps for Testing Act of 2012--or the TEST Act, as it is more commonly known--is a notable example of bureaucratic incompetence.  American families expect the Federal Government to work with healthcare providers, not against them, to ensure the efficient delivery of healthcare.  In 2012, the TEST Act was passed and signed into law due to the mandatory and harsh sanctions that CMS was then imposing on hospitals and labs that violated the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments Act--or CLIA, for short.  While CLIA regulations are necessary, in some instances, the sanctions that CMS imposed against hospitals and laboratories at the time that inadvertently violated the statute were found to be draconian and at odds with the efficient delivery of healthcare.  At the time the TEST Act was considered in 2012, Congress determined that there were instances where a hospital or laboratory's violations were accidental, unintentional, and resulted in no patient harm.  At the time, CMS lacked the flexibility to align the severity of the sanctions for minor and inadvertent actions at the lab, resulting in needless punitive penalties, such as revoking lab certificates and banning principals from owning or operating certified laboratories.  The TEST Act was passed in 2012 to provide CMS with needed discretion to substitute reasonable alternative sanctions in the event of minor or inadvertent violations. In lieu of the previously mandatory sanctions, the TEST Act allowed more appropriate remedies like directed plans of action, onsite monitoring, and/or modest monetary penalties.  Yet, despite being given this mandate and this flexibility, CMS has written its regulations and interpreted the underlying statute in a way that are clearly at odds with Congress' intent in the TEST There are serious impacts when CMS fails to use their congressionally mandated discretionary authority to issue appropriate sanctions.  Healthcare providers are forced to divert scarce resources to severe penalties, to oppressive settlements, and/or to a costly appeals process. These would not be needed if CMS had properly implemented the TEST This diverts scarce resources from patient care to dealing with an out-of-control CMS, and negatively impacts healthcare in our communities.  I have seen this firsthand in my district where a nonprofit faith-based community hospital committed an unintentional CLIA violation that resulted in no patient harm. The hospital then self-reported that violation, as we would expect any healthcare provider to do.  This hospital is my community's only level II trauma center and provides a significant amount of uncompensated care to the lower income population, including minority families. Yet, rather than working collaboratively with the hospital, CMS ignored the TEST Act and, instead, imposed crippling sanctions and forced the hospital to engage in a burdensome appeals process.  This action will cost this important community resource over $100 million per year. This arbitrary unwarranted action by CMS forces the hospital to divert finite resources toward an unnecessary bureaucratic process instead of taking care of patients.  CMS needs to change its implementation of the TEST Act to follow the law. In the meantime, my amendment sends a message that this is not how we expect our Federal Government to act in a time when we are articulating a new vision for building a better American healthcare system.  This amendment does this by reducing CMS spending on bureaucracy by $120 million and directing those funds toward true solutions for better healthcare by finding cures for pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's, and opioid abuse.

We all believe in being good stewards of the environmental and economic interest in our oceans.

That is the issue at stake here. The Obama administration's National Ocean Policy has overstepped constitutional statutory bounds.  Congress did pass a bill in the 106th Congress to create an Ocean Commission to review and make recommendations. Since then, the 108th, 109th, 110th, and 111th Congresses each looked at those recommendations and decided to take no legislative action. This must have been what caused then-President Obama to move forward with his executive order and to try to go around There have been no appropriations for these activities.  Additionally, 81 groups have signed a letter asking the Appropriations Committee to include this language to address this unconstitutional bureaucratic overreach in their annual appropriations bills.  Again, this is a simple amendment that stands up for the constitutional rights of this body to create the statutes under which this activity can be conducted and to transparently appropriate the funds which authorize activities, should it so choose.  We are not against Ocean planning, as I said at the outset of this. What we are for, though, is the Again, this amendment has been adopted with bipartisan support in this body eight times since 2010.

117,topic-id,753,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment highlights the need to think about our future workforce and how it will change because of technology and to encourage the Bureau of Labor Statistics to accept a wider and more forward-looking range of inputs into its range of projections for its workforce of the future.  I co-chair the New Democrat Coalition Future of Work Task Force with my colleagues, Congressman Seth Moulton and Congressman Jared Congressman Jim Himes, the chair of the New Dem Coalition, has been active in the task force work and joins me in cosponsoring this amendment today.  Over the course of several months, the task force has held a series of forums to hear from experts on various areas that will require this body's attention in the coming years and decades. We have heard from historians, economists, and policy experts about how technological revolutions of the past have impacted social and political institutions and how lessons from those experiences and from current conditions can help us prepare for the future.  We have also heard from labor and business leaders who are pioneering the way they attract talent, retain their services, and develop skills for the increasingly rapidly change economy. It is nearly unanimous among our experts that the economy will change significantly and change faster, but it is less clear just how quickly the workforce will need to adapt.  For decades, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been doing excellent and invaluable work to track our labor trends, and its projections have been proven very reliable and useful--to business and to our educators--in times of slower and relatively predictable technological development.  However, they are based on historical data and historical trends, and some of the anticipated changes in technology--such as robotics, self-driving vehicles, and artificial intelligence--could fundamentally change our economy in ways that haven't been seen before. So, in its current form, the way the Bureau calculates and estimates future development of the workforce may not be able to capture the dramatic changes that our future holds.  One panel convened by the task force suggested that it would be impossible to do projections in any single way to predict the workforce, but that, with additional resources, the Bureau of Labor Statistics could model for a variety of scenarios of different rates of technological change in different areas.  My amendment increases the BLS account by a dollar and decreases it by a dollar, and I intend it to mean that the BLS should submit to Congress an estimate of the resources it would need to make a range of forward-looking estimates, including consultation with those industries that are driving this rapid technological change and those that will be affected by that change to account for the increasing rate of technological job displacement.  It is hard to estimate by backward-looking extrapolations how the changes from self-driving cars and vehicles or artificial intelligence will affect the real jobs of the future.  Technological changes in the workforce are not new. The industrial revolution and the automation of agriculture transformed the way work was performed in our country and significantly improved, on the whole, our standard of living over time.                              {time}  1745  The results have not been uniform for all communities and all populations. Those transformations typically played out over generations, so our social and political institutions had ample time to respond. But today, development and deployment of technology is far more rapid, and Congress, business, and our educational system need the best possible data to evaluate policy proposals and to produce the workforce training needed for future employees and to develop educational curricula to ensure that our economy works for everyone.  Like in the industrial revolution, technological development presents the opportunity for a greatly improved standard of living, but it will also bring challenges to our workforce. Businesses, communities, and the government must work together.  Additional considerations in the projections made by the BLS will help Congress to anticipate these changes and to weigh proposed solutions. Objective projections based on empirical evidence are crucial to a debate that will be based on our different views of the role of government and its relationship with market forces. Those are the differences that should shape our ideas for helping Americans enjoy prosperous and full lives in the future.  I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on my amendment to begin to establish a range of scenarios for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the future world that we will inhabit.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgH7277-2.txt,1888,CONGRATULATING BERRY GLOBAL ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY,2017.0,12.0,September

875,topic-id,491,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor the nearly 3,000 souls that were taken from us much too soon on September 11, 16 years ago.  Like many others, the events of September 11, 2001, are forever etched in my memory. On that day, I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, serving in the State legislature, and recall an aide coming in to share the news.  Naturally, when hearing about the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, we all thought it was a terrible accident that had occurred. My colleagues and I were in a state of shock and grief when we heard about the second plane and the subsequent attacks that followed.  What I remember most is the feeling of abject horror and disbelief that we experienced on that day. That horror is still felt by the family members who were left behind, robbed of their loved ones who were violently taken too soon.  I often think of the brave first responders who ran towards danger with thought of little else other than to save their fellow  The terror attacks seemed surreal, yet the aftermath has a finality which does not dissipate with time. As years passed, the shock of the attack has diminished, but the memory of the feeling of hope that arose from the acts of selfless Americans is stronger.  In my mind, one of the very worst events in human history became overshadowed as the very best in us--as a people--was made evident through countless acts of kindness and dignity. It is this dignity we must hold on to in order to honor the fallen.  From the first responders, citizens, volunteers, and, finally, the devoted souls on board Flight 93, I remember the moments in which the very best parts of Americans shone brightest. These moments include when our citizens were no longer categorized by their differences, but were defined by their shared determination not only to survive, but also to overcome an unthinkable tragedy.  If a student asks me about my memories of September 11, I always tell them honestly of the horror I felt, and I tell them of the hope that emerged as our people did their level best to turn evil into good.  While I will never forget September 11, 2001, and the lives that were forever lost to us on that day, 16 years ago, I take some comfort in knowing that a loving and never-changing God called them to Heaven to live in His presence forever.  Now, more than ever before, we must recall the sacrifices made by so many in the aftermath of September 11 and recall that freedom is never truly freely given. It is earned. It is hard-fought for, and it is something we must all work together to continue to achieve.  May God bless all of those who lost their lives on September 11, those who were left behind, and those who continue to fight for our freedom.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgH7227.txt,1791,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017.0,12.0,September

198,topic-id,375,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to present a Senate amendment to H.601. As Texas and Louisiana begin the first steps of recovery from Hurricane Harvey, Congress must ensure that the funding is available to meet the short- and long-term needs of the hundreds of thousands of victims of that terrible storm. As we are all seeing unfold before our eyes, the next hurricanes could cause even more terrible devastation. This legislation is the first step in what will be long and difficult recoveries.  As our fellow Americans recover and rebuild their lives, we must come together to support the victims, the volunteers, the first responders on the ground from around the Nation, and Congress must ensure that the Federal Government provides the help they need.  With FEMA resources running low and Hurricane Irma on Florida's and the South's door, providing this additional funding is even more critical. As I said before, our committee is ready and willing to address any additional funding needs that may arise as a result of Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and other major disasters.  In addition to providing this desperately needed emergency aid, this bill also extends funding for the entire Federal Government operations until December 8 of this year. This continuing resolution will ensure that the Federal Government remains open for business and that important programs and services are maintained beyond the end of the fiscal year on the 30th of this month.  While I don't believe that a continuing resolution is the best way to fund our government, it is imperative to give us time to go to conference and complete our 12 full-year appropriations bills with the It is essential that all of these bills be signed into law and that our Nation avoids the uncertainty caused by a threat of a shutdown.  In addition, the bill also contains a short-term increase in the Federal debt limit and a reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance  All of these actions will allow for more certainty and stability for the Nation and for the communities and families suffering from these disasters.

626,topic-id,192,"Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues strongly to adopt this amendment.  Attorney General Sessions' recent announcement to expand civil action forfeiture really allows local law enforcement to bypass State laws and seize property from people with the lowest possible burden of evidence and without concern whether the person is eventually charged or convicted.  While some will tell you this is necessary to go after big drug cartels, the reality is the median value of the adoptive forfeiture seizures has been around $9,000--not exactly the sign of any major drug trafficking operation.  These adoptive forfeiture efforts tend to target poor neighborhoods. Between 2012 and 2017, the median value of assets seized by Cook County police was just over $1,000. In Philadelphia, in 2015, the median value was $192.  This policy does not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.  With the responsibility on private citizens to prove their innocence, rather than law enforcement to prove guilt, innocent people without legal representation often never see their money or property again, and even those who are proven innocent have no promise that their property will be returned.

Recently there have been reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries headquarters, located on Virginia Key in south Florida, may move to another location. This amendment would prohibit that move. Such a move would be devastating to the longstanding research relationships that the NOAA facility on Virginia Key has with local universities, the local business community, and the marine industries of south  The NOAA research facility on Virginia Key has maintained a partnership with the University of Miami and the south Florida community since 1943. Over the years, the NOAA facility and their research teams have worked closely and collaborated on critical research projects and scientific breakthroughs with the University of Miami, Florida Atlantic University, NOVA Southeastern University, Florida International University, the Palm Beach County Business Development Board, the Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance, the Beacon Council, the Marine Industries Association of South Florida, and other south Florida universities and business coalitions.  In fact, the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science is located across the street from the NOAA facility on Virginia These south Florida universities and business councils recently signed a formal memorandum of understanding that encourages collaboration among research, education, business, and economic development organizations.  Some research projects that the NOAA facility on Virginia Key has worked on with south Florida universities and business councils include the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, creating a storm surge database for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and something near and dear to my heart, Everglades restoration projects.  Moving the NOAA facility from Virginia Key would sever the bonds between the facility and the research universities in the south Florida community that create so much progress and so many jobs.

Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to speak in favor of this bill on behalf of Congressman Mike He is dealing with the aftereffects of Hurricane Irma, which is the tropical storm affecting his district.  Mr.Speaker, H.2470 received bipartisan support during consideration by the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence in May, and was included in the Department of Homeland Security authorization bill, which passed the floor in  H.2470 requires the Department of Homeland Security to release an annual comprehensive homeland security threat assessment. This will provide a common threat picture across the Department and for Federal, State, and local partners.  This week, we are recognizing 16 years after the horrific events of 9/11. Sixteen years later, our ability to accurately identify and evaluate threats to the homeland remains stunted, in many ways.  Though talented professionals across Federal agencies and at the State and local level are hard at work gathering and analyzing threat information, there is still not a formalized process that evaluates homeland threats in a meaningful and comprehensive way.  The assessment in this bill requires DHS to incorporate and analyze Departmental data in a strategic picture. By relying on information provided by the on-the-ground professionals, including State and local police and the Department's operational component, this threat assessment will be a unique contribution to the intelligence community, policymakers, and other stakeholders.  By requiring the Department to consider specific cyber, transportation, and border security threats, in addition to traditional terrorism threats, H.2470 ensures that DHS will focus on critical mission areas where it can provide real value.  Additionally, the threat assessment required by H.2470 can inform the Department's budgeting and planning by clarifying the nature and scale of the threats DHS was created to counter.

870,topic-id,2980,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security currently has nine designated component intelligence programs with trained analysts who could benefit from an authorized, better organized rotation program. In order to truly develop homeland security intelligence expertise, the DHS has to develop and expand programs to cross-train their broad cadre of analysts.  One of the major lessons we learned from the September 11 terror attacks was the vital need to connect the dots by sharing information across analytical silos and across agencies. The bill we are considering today builds upon this foundation by authorizing a rotation program for intelligence analysts across the  Having served as an intelligence analyst in the Marine Corps and in the intelligence community, including at the National Counterterrorism Center and the Drug Enforcement Agency, I know firsthand the value of analysts gaining experience in different mission areas and broadening their analytical skills.  H.2453, the DHS Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act of 2017, supports the effort to develop an integrated workforce of analysts that will ultimately develop a homeland security intelligence expertise. The bill authorizes the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program, or IRAP, and directs the Department to promote and reward participation.  There is an existing IRAP, but based on oversight efforts over the past year, it is clear the DHS needs a more integrated, coordinated, and transparent rotation program. For example, numerous intelligence components are not aware of the IRAP's existence, and it is not being coordinated with other rotational programs offered by the Department or the intelligence community at large.  Moreover, a recent joint inspector general review involving IGs from the intelligence community, the DHS, and the Department of Justice specifically referenced the creation of the IRAP as an important step to help unify the DHS intelligence enterprise, but noted the lack of incentives to encourage participation in this initiative. So this legislation seeks to address these shortcomings by authorizing the IRAP and providing the program with a management structure and participation incentives.  Having a robust analyst rotation program is important for a number of reasons. First, it offers key professional development opportunities to analysts by exposing them to the legal authorities, collection capabilities, and data sets associated with different intelligence offices across the It also is an important building block in the development of homeland security intelligence as a core competency above and beyond individual mission areas at the  Finally, the IRAP enhances the cohesion of the DHS intelligence enterprise by exposing intelligence analysts to their counterparts in one of the eight other intelligence components, thus encouraging them to see themselves as part of the larger DHS intelligence enterprise.  In short, this bill promotes a more robust intelligence analyst rotation program to ensure the Department is building a network of employees with a true homeland security intelligence expertise.  Mr.Speaker, this bill will make the country more safe. I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on            Intelligence,                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.     Michael McCaul,     Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Washington,                Dear Chairman McCaul: I understand H.2453, 2468, and      2470 are slated for consideration on the suspension calendar      next week. All three bills amend the Homeland Security Act of      2002 to make certain improvements in the laws administered by      the Secretary of Homeland Security by requiring the      Secretary, acting through the Chief Intelligence Officer of      the Department, to perform specific intelligence-related      functions. All three bills are virtually identical to      specific provisions contained in H.2825, the House-passed      ``Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017''      for which I wrote to you about on June 27, 2017. Accordingly,      since H.2453, 2468, and 2470 implicate National      Intelligence Program (NIP)-funded activities, I expect that      they would be sequentially referred to the Permanent Select      Committee on Intelligence (the Committee).       As discussed in previous correspondence regarding H.     2825, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the      Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters on      January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to      clarify the Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over NIP-     funded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).      The January 2017 Exchange of Letters affirmed that,      consistent with the Rules of the House of Representatives,      the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is the vehicle that      through which Congress authorizes annual appropriations for      the NIP, including NIP-funded elements of the Department of      Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those Letters made      explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security would not      report to the House any bill that authorizes any elements of      DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such bill is      reported by the Committee[[Page H7233]]     on Homeland Security, this Committee will request a      sequential referral of the bill.       In order to expedite the House's consideration of H.     2453, 2468, and 2470, the Committee will forego consideration      of all three measures. This courtesy, is however, conditioned      on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no      way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with      respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matter contained in these bills or any similar measure. It is      also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security's      adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017      Exchange of       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding and would request that you include in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration of all three      bills, a copy of this letter, your response, and the January      2017 Exchange of Letters, including the Thank you      for your cooperation in this matter.

Understanding, however, that both of our committees have a      jurisdictional interest in the Department's Office of      Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to work together to      ensure that the Office receives the most effective      congressional guidance.       Finally, I reiterate my intention that nothing included in      the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the      Department of Homeland Security'' alters the jurisdiction of      either the Committee on Homeland Security or the Permanent      Select Committee on The Committee on Homeland      Security appreciates the past success we have enjoyed working      with the Intelligence I am grateful for your      support and look forward to continuing to work together      toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the Department and      its components are authorized on a regular basis.

The committees will expedite consideration of any      comprehensive authorization bill for the Department,      including timely resolution of any matters subject to a      sequential or additional referral.       7. To the extent that there are policy differences between      the committees regarding a provision of the comprehensive      authorization bill for the Department, the committees will      make best efforts to resolve any such dispute.       8. The Committee on Homeland Security Committee shall not      include any provision in a comprehensive authorization bill      that the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means has      determined to be a revenue provision or a provision affecting      revenue.

324,topic-id,201,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment prohibits the Department of Labor and OSHA from implementing a burdensome rule dealing with reporting workplace injuries and illness.  The OSHA rule requires all businesses with more than 250 employees to file all illness and injury reports in a publicly available database. It would also be a requirement for any business with more than 20 employees in certain industries such as manufacturing or agriculture.  This online filing requirement raises serious privacy concerns. While employers were previously required to collect this information, it was never open and available to the public.  The rule risks the confidentiality of personally identifiable information for those injured on the job.  Additionally, a provision in the final rule declaring automatic postaccident drug testing is now considered an unreasonable procedure, a provision that conflicts with multiple States' workers' compensation laws.  While the Trump administration has wisely delayed the implementation of the regulation, it is important to prevent any future development of this rule.  I encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment, which rolls back another one-size-fits-all regulation from Washington, D.C., that potentially interferes with the privacy of employers and employees for the entirety of fiscal year 2018.

So the idea that there is no documentation of any workplace injuries or illnesses is still there.  The problem here is that it is put on a website, that could have issues with FOIA requests, also publicly available. Businesses will be forced to sensitive information and confidential information that will be public information that risks the identity of many employees out there.  OSHA has historically recognized the sensitive nature of this data and sought to protect this information being released on, as I said, the Freedom of Information Act request.  Furthermore, OSHA has failed to demonstrate any evidence that this rule will effectively reduce workplace injuries and illnesses. I think the point to remember here is that employers are required to keep the records of that, and OSHA inspectors can see that. So when OSHA comes in and inspects a business entity, they can look at those records and see what the workplace injuries are and red flag them, and they have that ability.

749,topic-id,216,"Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.  My colleague, Mr.Mullin, is absolutely correct. When former President Obama directed the EPA, BLM, and other agencies to target industries for greenhouse gas emissions, they went directly for oil and natural gas first. But this EPA rule targeting methane is completely unnecessary.  Though methane is a byproduct of oil and natural gas production, it is also a valuable product in and of itself, and that is something that oil and gas companies routinely capture and sell rather than emit. Even EPA estimates show that methane emissions have decreased, while the production of natural gas and oil increased over the same period.  The free market has provided an incentive to reduce methane release on its own. There is no further need for EPA to impose costly bureaucratic hurdles on these sensitive industries.  And make no mistake: This rule imposes a steep burden. It is estimated to cost our economy $530 million annually.  Natural gas and oil production will continue to be pillars of an energy-friendly American economy. But instead of reducing barriers to growth, as President Trump has requested, this rule cripples our industries by duplicating what a combination of market forces and existing regulations have already produced.

859,topic-id,1249,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to question the plan for auditing the Department of The new Chief Financial Officer, Mr.David Norquist, presented a plan to the Armed Services Committee on May 9. It appears flawed, like a lot of other such plans. The Department[[Page S5204]]may be audit ready by the September 30 deadline, but the goal--and the goal ought to be a clean opinion--isn't in the mix. In its place, we get another lame excuse: ``I recognize it will take time to go from being audited to passing an audit.''  We have heard this story over and over for 26 years. When will it come to an end?  I don't think the Pentagon has a clue if the Department is truly audit ready. Then, why is the Chief Financial Officer predicting failure before the audit even starts?  Doubletalk is necessary to accomplish that goal. A monster is lurking in the weeds, and nobody wants to talk about it. It is the ``deal-breakers.'' That is a term that is often used in audit reports. They are red-flagged accounting issues listed in Department of Defense reports for years and years. They are prefaced by this warning: ``The deal-breakers prevent clean opinions.''  If Mr.Norquist wants to win this war, he had better get on top of the ``deal-breakers.'' But he ignored them in testimony, focusing instead on this apparent distraction: DOD has spent too much time ``preparing for full-scope audit without starting it.''  We need to pinpoint ``vulnerabilities''--those are his words, and he went on--``to drive change to a clean opinion.'' Suggesting that the Department of Defense lags behind on audit starts or needs more audits to spot weaknesses seems very wrongheaded. The Department has conducted nonstop audits since 1991--294 financial audits, to be exact--and 90 percent were failures, but a few were full-scope audits with clean opinions. Together, the Corps of Engineers and the Military Retirement Fund earned 28 clean opinions out of 43 starts. In the case of the Corps of Engineers, auditors relied on unorthodox procedures known as ``manual workarounds'' or ``audit trail reconstruction work.'' Highly paid auditors scramble around searching for missing records. These procedures work on small jobs, but the point is that they are an inefficient substitute for a modern accounting system.  Now, I have talked about small jobs. To the contrary, on big jobs this approach is a nonstarter. Yet, that is exactly where Mr.Norquist intends to go--the toughest, the unauditable: the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the rest of the Defense This is where auditing hits the wall--over 200 starts without a successful finish.  If these audits begin before the accounting house is in order, the Norquist plan may be swallowed up by the swamp. The destructive power of the deal-breakers was hammered home by the most important audit so far--the Marine Corps audit. Their impact was exposed in a first-rate report issued by the Government Accountability I spoke at length about that report on the Marines on August 4, 2015. Today, I will touch on it just briefly. This background is very, very important.  Back in September 2008, the Marine Corps, the smallest of the big ones, stepped up to the plate. The Marine Corps boldly declared that it was audit ready. As a pilot project, the Marine Corps would lead the way. High hopes for a breakthrough were not to be. Ten years and five audits later, the Marine Corps is still stuck on square one. The inspector general and the Government Accountability Office determined that it was never ready for audit. It failed for the same reasons as all the other audits failed, going back to the term ``deal breakers.''  To make matters worse, there was an attempt to cover up these shortcomings. Initially, a clean opinion was issued. The then-Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, gave the Marine Corps an award for being the first service to earn a clean opinion. The opinion did not stand up to scrutiny. The evidence did not meet ``professional auditing standards.'' So the inspector general had to withdraw, leaving Mr.Hagel with egg all over his face.  The deputy inspector general for audit was removed and reassigned, and the accounting firm involved lost the contract to Kearney & Company, where the now Chief Financial Officer, Mr.Norquist, was a partner.  Without strong leadership, the Marine Corps could be the Norquist template. This is where we have been before: audit ready but light years away from a clean opinion. So that takes you to nowheresville. Why go there when you know what you are going to find? Although lessons were learned, the end result was mostly waste--$32 million for five premature audits. DOD is big, big business for these auditing firms, and what do we get? No clean opinion.  The deal-breakers, which doomed the Marine Corps audit and all the others, are alive and well. They are still driving the freight train with no fix in sight. Yet, in spite of these formidable barriers, the Marine Corps is once again shooting for the moon. It jumped out in front of all the other military services by starting a full financial audit, which the press calls a ``mammoth task.'' Why would the outcome be any different this time around, when we just exposed within the last 2 years that what they thought was a clean audit was not such a clean audit.  The government's expert on accounting--and I call him the expert on government accounting because he is Comptroller General Gene Dodaro--understands the dilemma. The $10 billion spent annually on fixing the accounting system, he says, ``has not yielded positive results.'' Money is being spent in the wrong places. Mr.Dodaro wonders if the Department of Defense has the talent to get it right, and that is his word--``talent.''  With his plan resting on shaky ground, Mr.Norquist may need to shift gears. For starters, the cost of the full financial audits, which are touted as the largest ever undertaken, could top $200 million. Spending so much money on audits doomed to failure would be a gross waste of tax dollars.  Now, I am not suggesting that Mr.Norquist back off. Mr.Norquist just needs to get a handle on the root cause of the problem, and the feeder systems are that root cause. As a main source of unreliable transaction data, the feeder systems are the driver behind the deal-breakers. Fix them, and then the rest should be just a piece of cake.  Department of Defense reports have repeatedly called for ``testing the feeder systems.'' However, according to the Government Accountability Office, those tests were never, never performed.  So the aggressive testing and aggressive verification of transactions are the right places to start. Senators Johnson, Ernst, Paul, and this Senator are sponsoring an amendment to make that happen.  Once all of the tricky technical issues are ironed out and testing provides confidence that the system is reliable, the plan will gel. Audit readiness will be self-evident, not contrived. Full financial accounting could begin. Clean opinions should follow, and those clean opinions should be our goal.  There has been 26 years of hard-core foot-dragging that shows that internal resistance to auditing the books runs very, very deep. It will take strong, confident leadership and strong determination to root out that internal resistance to auditing the books. I am counting on Secretary Mattis and Chief Financial Officer Norquist to get the job done in the shortest time possible.  I yield the floor.

Since its inception, the NLRB has served as a partisan board that flips in ideology from one administration to the next, often cutting businesses off at the knees and stifling economic growth.  In just the last 8 years of the Obama administration, the NLRB managed to overturn a total of 4,105 collective years of precedent in 90 cases. In cases such as the ambush election rule and the joint employer rule, the board significantly overstepped their bounds and dipped their hands into the day-to-day business operations of hardworking  Now, let me be clear: I am not here to attack the unions. I wish more people would join unions under the amendment that we just dealt with.

But the fact remains, since 1990, the NLRB has received 65 percent fewer election petitions and 40 percent fewer unfair labor practice charges.

Since we last met, we began spending, I guess, a new $15 billion on the tragedies in Florida and I haven't had a chance to see how all of my colleagues are doing, but I sure hope that we are getting nothing but amendments designed to reduce spending to make up for the difference. I hope that is so.  I am looking at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and I am on the Government Oversight We recently had another hearing on Fast and I don't think there has been enough contrition there at all. This was, I think, probably the biggest scandal in my lifetime, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has to consider themselves to be a big part of that scandal.  Being from Wisconsin, I am also familiar with a local scandal we had there. If you google ``ATF'' and ``Milwaukee,'' you will find a situation in which they were selling guns which they shouldn't have been selling and buying guns which they shouldn't have been buying. So there is another reason why we should look at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Despite these scandals, their funding has gone nothing but up over the last few years. We are, in this budget, looking to borrow between 13 to 14 percent of this budget, and that is before we begin to have to spend money on the Florida and Texas hurricanes.  I am introducing a bill with a mild 5 percent across-the-board cut to President Trump had wanted a smaller increase. The Appropriations Committee went $20 million over what President Trump wanted. I don't think that is right. I think they need a little bit of a slap-down here.  I am looking to reduce the amount of spending on this organization by $64 million. I think that is very appropriate given the scandals that they have been involved in. It is very appropriate given that we are borrowing 14 percent of our money. In the sane world, we would almost take every agency down 14 percent. We don't have time for that, but this agency, based on their behavior, seems in favor of that.  I know some people are going to probably not want to cut anything here. We just heard in the last amendment that it appears like some people want to go up. I think this is a modest decrease, and I think they should have no problem finding this small amount of money.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

We have heard the statement made, sometimes behind closed doors by a lot of people, and that is we have an increase of discretionary spending over the last 3 years. This is a mild cut this year, but over the last 3 years, collectively, it is an increase, 3 or 4 years.  There are some people who feel that we shouldn't scrutinize that spending because so much of our budget is mandatory spending. I do feel that we need a larger cut in mandatory spending than the rather modest cut that came out of the Budget Committee, and I hope everybody in our Conference will demand a more significant cut in mandatory spending.  But, nevertheless, discretionary spending is 30 percent of the budget. Common sense will tell you that, as things become more technology oriented, it should be easier for an agency that processes data, like the ATF, to do their business with a little bit less money.  And one more time I will emphasize that there haven't been cuts to reflect these scandals in the ATF, and I think that, if we are not going to kind of slap them on the wrist now, when will we?

557,topic-id,379,"Mr.Chairman, everyone here appreciates concerns about the ways of discrimination. The question is how to collect the data in an efficient way, and the new EEOC-1 form is certainly not the way to collect that data.  What do I mean by that, Mr.Chairman?  You have to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges. It is not like we don't collect data already. We have 140 different data points on the EEOC-1 form. This would increase the number of data points to 3,306 that an employer potentially would have to report.  Mr.Chairman, if we had better data, that is all right, but let's take a specific example: a large hospital. The new form groups all professionals together. A hospital would have to report what it pays its professionals in the same category, what it pays its female professionals and its male professionals. But, Mr.Chairman, it includes nurses and surgeons in the same category. They are all professionals. In fact, in the United States, for instance, among registered nurses, we have about 3 million--89 percent--are females.  Now, in the United States, we have an estimated number of physicians and surgeons of about 900,000; 65 percent are males, only 35 percent females. They are all grouped in the same category for the EEOC-1 form.  So what would the result be? If you were in a hospital and you had nurses and you had employee surgeons, it would look like you were discriminating against women because the nurses get paid less, and your average salary is going to be less for your women because you have grouped surgeons in with nurses. Only a Federal Government bureaucrat could come up with an idea like that in order to gauge whether wage discrimination occurs.  The fact of the matter is it is even worse, Mr.Chairman, because, based on the reporting of these results, EEOC can go on a fishing expedition against[[Page H7265]]whatever institution it wants to that files this.

450,topic-id,615,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Sixteen years after the 9/11 attacks by al-Qaida terrorists on our homeland,[[Page H7244]]most Americans would be dismayed that information-sharing stovepipes still exist.  While information sharing since that fateful day has improved dramatically, we still have work to do at the Department of Homeland When the DHS was created, 22 component agencies were brought together with different missions, databases, and legal authorities.  The DHS personnel have to deal with a costly, cumbersome process to search and vet information against a large number of databases, using different logins, passwords, and legal restrictions.  The DHS data framework was designed to bring together these vital DHS datasets, including travel and cargo information, investigative data, and critical infrastructure data, among others.  The other important element of the framework is the replication of the platform on a classified network to allow classified analysis and vetting of law enforcement data against intelligence information.  Given the importance of the Data Framework Initiative, the need to weigh security versus civil liberties, as well as the Federal Government's history of delays and cost overruns on IT projects, it is critical that this program receive congressional oversight.  This bill provides the first authorization for the data framework, mandates privacy and security safeguards, as well as training for Department personnel with access to the system.  In addition to the personnel training and privacy safeguards, this bill also requires the Secretary to ensure information in the framework is both protected and audible.  I was pleased that the Committee on Homeland Security included this bill in the DHS authorization bill, which passed the floor in July, and I urge my colleagues to again support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2454, the Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act directs the DHS to consolidate existing intelligence databases and systems at the Department in order to establish a data framework.  Specifically, H.2454 requires the DHS to ensure that the data framework is accessible to DHS employees who the Secretary determines have an appropriate security clearance, have responsibilities that require access to framework information, and are trained in applicable standards for safeguarding and using such information.  By strengthening the DHS data framework, authorized personnel from each of the components and offices at the Department will have easier access to the data that they need in a timely manner.  Additionally, the DHS Security Data Framework Act of 2017 allows the DHS Secretary to incorporate into the data framework systems capabilities for auditing and ensuring the security of information within the framework. Such capabilities include mechanisms for identifying insider threats and security risks, and safeguards for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.  The anniversary of 9/11 is a time for reflection and remembrance, and also a time to enhance our defenses. We cannot allow weak data infrastructure to leave the homeland vulnerable to attacks, and I thank my good friend and colleague from Texas, Mr.Hurd, for introducing this commonsense legislation, and I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, this is an important bill that has strong support on both sides of the aisle. It maintains effective security measures while consolidating systems, creating a more feasible way for the men and women at the DHS to access the data that they need to fulfill their critical mission.  I thank Mr.Hurd for his diligence on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.2454, and I yield back the balance of my time.

855,topic-id,2103,"Mr.President, I want to discuss an amendment, and I am not sure when it will be offered--I understand it will be offered--and I think it is very significant.  First of all, let's keep in mind what this is all about. The NDAA is the National Defense Authorization It is one that we know is going to pass. It has passed for 55 consecutive years. If something happened and it didn't pass, the troops wouldn't get hazard pay or flight pay, and it would really be a traumatic thing that would happen. But it is not going to happen. It is going to pass. It is the most important bill that I believe we pass every year. As I said, we have passed it for 55 consecutive years, and it is important that we pass it right away. Sometimes it gets stalled until later in the year, but if it isn't done by the end of December, that is when everything falls apart. So we just don't need to do that, and I believe we have the momentum to go ahead and get it done.  Now, we are facing a threat. I have stood at this podium so many times now to talk about how I look back wistfully at the days of the Cold War when we had two superpowers. We knew what they had. They knew what we had. Mutually shared destruction meant something, but now it is totally different.  We hear that the two biggest threats facing us right now would be North Korea and I stand on the side that it is North Korea because North Korea is run by someone with a questionable mentality, and they are developing--I have watched them over the years--the capabilities that they now have. I certainly agree that Iran also is a serious threat. But the fact is that our Armed Forces are now in a condition that they have not been in for a long time.  I chair the Subcommittee on Readiness in the Senate, and we had the vice chairs testify before us not too long ago. They testified that we are in worse shape now than we were during the hollow force of the 1970s, right after the Carter administration. Many of us remember that, and I certainly do. Our Armed Forces are smaller than in the days of the hollow force in the 1970s, and readiness in the form of personnel, training, and equipment have been degraded, I think, to a breaking point. All the while, we have witnessed an uptake in the training and operational accidents across the Armed While the risks posed by the readiness crisis are significant, Congress is already taking steps to correct the shortfalls.  Every amendment considered for the NDAA should focus on increasing readiness across our services. We owe it to[[Page S5202]]our troops and our Nation to help ensure that levels are acceptable. That is why it is disappointing and dangerous that we are considering an amendment that would authorize a base realignment and closure round, better known to all of us as a BRAC round. We have had five BRAC rounds since 1989, and I am familiar with all of them. I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate Armed Services Committee, successfully have a provision that would include a prohibition against a BRAC right now. I think it is pretty obvious. Everyone knows what the threat is out there. At least those on the Armed Services Committee do. But they also know that any BRAC round that you do is going to have the effect of costing a lot of money that should be spent on readiness. No matter what a base realignment and closure, or BRAC, is, the amount of money that is spent when you first start is going to be very expensive.  Unfortunately, an amendment is pending that would enable a new BRAC round in 2019, and, at the same time, remove--this is critical--the nonpartisan commission that allows the input of both local defense communities and Congress into the BRAC process.  I will tell my colleagues why that is important. I remember because it was shortly after I was first elected. Prior to 1989, the Defense Department was the agency that made the decisions as to what was going to happen to our various installations around It was very, very political. There were rumors or some stories that they would agree for certain considerations to allow someone to continue to operate when they really shouldn't be operating.  Well, the Pentagon claims that a BRAC round would save money and would allow the military to invest that money into critical readiness shortfalls. It is just not true. Before the most recent BRAC round in 2005, we heard these same arguments from the Pentagon, that the BRAC would somehow save money and would allow the military to increase efficiency. With 22 major base closings and 33 realignments--that is what happened in 2005--the round was depicted to save, over a 20-year period, $35 billion, with costs of $21 billion. The reality is far different. The 2005 BRAC round cost taxpayers roughly $35 billion, and it is only expected to save $9.9 billion over the next 20 years.  Now, the other day I went back and looked up just to see what the GAO said about that. Keep in mind that it was a 2005 BRAC round, but the GAO study was actually in 2011, saying: We know what we said at that time; let's see how they performed.  So let me read right out of their report: The ``one-time implementation costs''--that is the cost of putting together a BRAC round--``grew from $21 billion originally estimated by the BRAC Commission in 2005 to about $35 billion.'' In other words, they said it was going to cost $21 billion, and it ended up costing $35 billion. That is an increase of 67 percent. It has been that way with the other rounds too.  Looking at their analysis of the value, it is very important that we understand what they are saying here. The GAO said that ``the 20-year net present value DOD can expect by implementing the 2005 BRAC recommendations has decreased by 72 percent.''  In other words, they were 72 percent off as to what great savings we were going to have in the future by making these closures.  They went on to say that ``the 20-year net present value--that is, the present value of future savings minus the present value of up-front investment costs--of $35.6 billion estimated by the Commission in 2005 for this BRAC round has decreased by 72 percent.'' It cannot be more specific than that, and this is the consistent pattern that we have.  So, clearly, those base closure rounds cost the American taxpayers an exorbitant amount of money up front and take years to recoup their initial investment, if they ever do. In this case, they haven't, and they don't expect to. With the history of previous inconsistencies between expected and actual costs, there is no certainty that any proposed base closures or realignments would be economically viable now or at any time in the future.  Now, we are at a point of uncertainty that makes it irresponsible to expend billions of dollars in downsizing our Armed Forces when we are currently facing some of the most volatile, unpredictable, and dangerous military threats that America has ever seen. Readiness can't wait, and our enemies around the world will not.  We must also consider the possibility that we will soon require the capacity that is presently considered excess if the current military threats materialize in a manner that would encourage expansion of our armed services.  I think that just stands to reason. We know the threats are out there, and we know the problems are more severe than they have ever been in the history of this country. So maybe the current size of our forces would not be adequate. Well, it is a lot cheaper to go ahead and keep something that is already there than it is to tear down something and start all over again.  So, anyway, as to the early years, everybody knows that the certainty is there that it will cost money in the early years. The high cost of a BRAC round would divert resources away from addressing immediate, tangible threats.  Just last week, North Korea tested what is believed to be a hydrogen bomb, its most powerful nuclear weapon tested to date, estimated at nearly seven times as powerful as the bomb detonated over This came on the heels of North Korea's first successfully tested and more powerful and far-ranging intercontinental ballistic missile, or We are familiar with that test, which began over the summer. Now, if fired on a trajectory, experts believe the ICBMs that North Korea tested could have reached the United States of  I can remember talking about this with our intelligence department years ago. At that time, we were saying that they could finally develop a bomb and a delivery system that could reach the United States of Well, that may be here today. If not, it is imminent.  A BRAC round now would also shortchange a response to the immediate readiness needs. Over the last 90 days, we have witnessed a spike in accidents across the military services, especially in the Navy and in some of the aviation mishaps. While these accidents are still under investigation--under investigation to determine the cause--it is not hard to correlate them with the readiness decline.  Our forces are smaller than the days of the hollow force in the 1970s. Our equipment is aging. Our base infrastructure requires critical maintenance and upgrades. Our Air Force is short 1,500 pilots, and 1,300 of those are fighter pilots. Only 50 percent of the Air Force squadrons are trained and ready to conduct their assigned missions. The Navy is the smallest and the least ready it has been in years. It currently can only meet about 40 percent of the demand for regional combat commanders. We are talking about the commanders in the field who make that assessment. We can only carry out less than 40 percent of them. More than half of Navy aircraft are grounded because they are awaiting maintenance or lack necessary parts. The Marine Corps' F/A-18s, known as the Hornets, 62 percent are broken. We don't have that capacity. The Army has said about one-third of their brigade combat teams, one-fourth of their combat aviation brigades, and one-half of their division headquarters are currently ready.  Speaking in January about the Army readiness, then-Vice Chief of Staff of the Army General Allyn said:       What it comes down to . . . we will be too late to need. .      . . Our soldiers will arrive too late, our units will require      too much time to close the manning, training, and equipment      gap . . . the end result is excessive casualties to civilians      and to our forces who are already forward-stationed.  We are talking about lives. We are talking about American lives. That is a sobering assessment, especially when considering the gravity of the threats we face around the world, including, of course, the Korean  The NDAA's first priority has to be to rebuild our force and improve its readiness, which is what we are in the process of doing right now, and we need to get it done. A BRAC round would divert vast resources away from this end for savings we would not see for decades to come, if we ever did--and we[[Page S5203]]are growing, not shrinking. Now is not the time for a BRAC round.  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in rejecting this amendment. However well-intentioned, now is not the time for a shortsighted BRAC round.  There are still Members--I have talked to Senators who are saying they really believe, and they have been told, that somehow we are going to have more money for readiness if we have a BRAC round. It is exactly the opposite. Again, straight from the GAO, they made the analysis of the 2005 BRAC, and said the 20-year net present value DOD can expect by implementing the 2005 BRAC recommendations has decreased by 72 percent. It always costs a lot more on the front end and saves much less in the long run.  With that, I encourage my colleagues to reject this amendment, if this amendment is indeed offered.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

365,topic-id,375,"Mr.President, sexual assault is a major issue on our Nation's college campuses. Too many young people are sexually assaulted while in school. Alarmingly, the majority of these crimes will go unreported. The consequences of these crimes are often destructive to a student's mental, physical, and emotional well-being. In addition, the trauma of the assault and its aftermath drives many survivors to drop out of school.  Sexual assault survivors deserve access to a safe and supportive educational environment. I have met with students in Virginia and across the Country who have expressed the need for someone on campus to turn to for unbiased advice and guidance following an assault. Given the prevalence of this issue, it is clear that our federal higher education policy must do more to prevent sexual assaults and ensure that survivors have access to and can navigate through a plethora of resources.  This is why I am pleased to introduce today the Survivor Outreach and Support Campus Act of 2017 or SOS Campus The SOS Campus Act requires universities that receive Federal funding to establish an independent, on-campus advocate for survivors of sexual assault. The advocate will help students access all of the resources available to them, both on and off campus, in the wake of a sexual assault and will guide them through the process of reporting their assault if they choose to do so, acting always in the interests of the victim, not the university.  The SOS Campus Act requires that the confidential advocate is responsible for ensuring that survivors, regardless of whether they decide to report the crime, have access to emergency and follow-up medical care, guidance on reporting assaults to law enforcement, medical forensic or evidentiary exams, crisis intervention, and information on their legal rights. The advocate will also conduct a public information campaign on campus to inform students of their services, and train other university staff to provide information to students about the advocate.  I am proud to introduce this legislation that would ensure all college students across our Country have access to a supportive advocate following a sexual assault on campus. I strongly ertdourage my colleagues in the Senate to consider this legislation to help protect our students from sexual violence and its damaging impact.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgS5219.txt,2176,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017.0,12.0,September
860,topic-id,2067,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the pending In particular, I rise to speak about an amendment that has been previously discussed on the floor that is being offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr.Paul, that deals with the current authorizations for use of military force that are justifying American military action in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and numerous other countries.  The authorizations that currently support military actions were passed in 2001 and 2002. About a quarter of us were here and voted on those. Three-quarters of us have joined either the Senate or the House since those authorizations have been voted on. What that means is that we have American troops who are deployed in harm's way, that thousands have been killed, that thousands have their lives at risk right now, and that three-quarters of Congress has never voted to support the military operations that are currently underway. Many of us support them or support them with recommendations or reservations or qualifications, but three-quarters of us have never cast a vote.[[Page S5205]]  These authorizations are, respectively, 15 and 16 years old. The authorizations have, essentially, been interpreted in a very broad way--first, by the Bush administration; second, by the Obama administration; and now by the current Trump administration. I would argue that the current interpretation of the authorizations would essentially allow, without any approval from Congress, an American President to wage war anywhere against any terrorist group for however long he wants to.  That was not the intention of the authorizations when they were originally drafted. If you were to go back and talk to those who had been here and cast their votes in 2001 and 2002, they would say that it was completely beyond their contemplation that what they were voting for then, which was going after those who had attacked the Pentagon--9/11 was yesterday--and the World Trade Center, would 16 years later still be used to support military action in a total of 14 countries in 35 separate instances having been declared by the last three administrations.  Senator Paul has an amendment on the table, and the amendment is this: to sunset the 2001 and 2002 authorizations in 6 months as a mechanism for forcing Congress to finally do the job of having a debate and defining the legal authority of the military mission that we are currently engaged in and putting a senatorial and congressional thumbprint on the mission so that those who are risking their lives know that they are doing so with a political consensus by the American political leadership here in I am supporting Senator Paul's amendment.  I think it is way past time for Congress to take this up and for everybody to be on the record. I think that our allies need to know whether Congress supports the American military missions that are currently underway. I think that our adversary needs to know that there is a congressional resolve, not just an Executive resolve. Most importantly, I think that the American troops who are deployed in harm's way every day deserve an answer to the question of whether Congress is behind them.  I came to Congress being very focused on this and to the Senate in January of 2013. I gave my first speech about it on the floor in the summer of 2013, when President Obama expanded the military action against al-Qaida to also incorporate military action against ISIS, which did not form until 2 years after the 9/11 attack. I filed my first military authorization, seeking to get Congress on board and to send to the troops the message that we supported them. That was now almost 3 years ago. I was once able to get a vote on an authorization in the Foreign Relations It passed out of committee but died for lack of any action on the floor.  Since 2015, out of a thought that we should try to be at least as bipartisan as we could in putting support behind the troops and carrying out our article I responsibilities, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and I have worked together, first, in introducing in 2015--and then in reintroducing this year--an authorization for use of military force. We have a pending authorization that we filed in June, which has been pending in the Foreign Relations Committee, to set forth a military authorization with certain conditions to undertake and legally justify military action against al-Qaida, ISIS, and the That has been pending in the Foreign Relations Committee, but there has been no particular motive or forcing mechanism that has made the committee take this up, bat it around, hear from experts, debate it, amend it, and send it to the floor.  I think, of all of the powers that Congress has, the one that we should most jealously guard is the power to declare war. James Madison was the drafter of the Constitution, and he gathered great ideas from others. The 230th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution is this Sunday, September 17--Constitution Day in The Constitution was a great collection of wonderful ideas, many that had been tried out in other nations, but the genius of it was the way in which we got the best of the best and tried to put them together in the document.  It has been said by many historians that there were only about two items in the Constitution circa 1787 that were truly unique and that we were doing for the first time. One was the protection of the ability of the people to worship as they pleased without preference or punishment, which had been drawn from a statute that had been passed in Virginia in 1780, the Statute for Religious The second idea that was very unique to our country and was, really, an effort by the Framers of our Constitution to change the course of human history was the idea that war should only be initiated by Congress and not by the  The Framers of the Constitution knew in 1787 about Executives and Executive overreach, especially in matters of war. They knew Kings, Emperors, Monarchs, Sultans, and Popes, and they knew that that was how war started. Madison decided that we were going to do it differently, and the Framers and those who voted in Philadelphia agreed with him. The Constitutional Convention's minutes that were taken by Madison and others demonstrated what they were trying to do.  Madison explained it in a letter to President Jefferson about 10 years later, when Jefferson was grappling with questions of war. Madison wrote in the letter that our Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrate--that it is the Executive that is most interested in war and, thus, is most prone to war. For this reason, we have, with studied care, placed the question of war in the legislature. Madison was trying to change it so that war could not be initiated without a vote of  In my view--and I was tough on a President of my own party about this--when President Obama decided to initiate offensive military action against ISIS in August of 2014, I said: You must come to When President Trump used military might--in this instance, weapons against Syria--to undertake the laudable step of punishing the use of chemical weapons against civilians, I said: I will support you with a vote, but you cannot do that without That is because there is nothing in the authorizations that are currently pending that allow the United States to take military action against the Government of  Yet we have gotten so sloppy about this. Frankly, we have been sloppy about it just about since 1787. If I can be blunt, throughout our history, regardless of party--Whig or Federalist, Democrat or Republican--Members of Congress have often concluded that a war vote is a very difficult vote and that, if we could allow the President to initiate it without a vote, we might be politically insulated from the consequences of the vote. That has been a uniform trend, and it has been a nonpartisan one. That is one of the reasons that we are where we are right now in Congress's being reluctant to take up war votes. These are difficult votes.  I have been on the Foreign Relations Committee since January 2013 and have cast two votes for military action--first, against Syria for using chemical weapons in the summer of 2013 and, second, in the matter that I mentioned earlier in voting for a war authorization against ISIS in December of 2014. I will say that there is no vote that you will ever cast that is harder.  I come from a State with a great military tradition. More people in Virginia are connected to the military--either as Active Duty, veteran, Guard, Reserve, DOD civilian or military contractor or military family--than in any other One of my children is a Marine infantry commander. Any war vote--if not immediately, then prospectively--affects him and the people whom he works with and cares deeply about.  These are very, very hard votes. They are supposed to be hard, but that is no reason to duck them. Congress is supposed to take this up, not hand any President of any party a carte blanche to go to war without a vote of Even against bad guys like ISIS or even against a Syrian dictator who is using chemical weapons against civilians, we are not supposed to be at war without a vote of  So I am here to support Senator Paul's amendment, which would take these old and outdated authorizations and sunset them within 6 months. I view his amendment as being an attempt to force Congress to do what it should do, which is to have a debate anew after 16 years and come up with a crafted legal authority and appropriate[[Page S5206]]strategy for carrying out military actions against nonstate terrorist groups.  I applaud my colleague from Arizona, Senator Flake, because he and I have worked together very hard on this issue. We have a matter that is pending. If Senator Paul's amendment passes, the result of his amendment will be that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and this body will have to grapple with what is an appropriate authorization circa 2017 to replace the authorizations from 2001 and 2002.  We shouldn't be afraid of that discussion. We should relish it and protect the power of Congress to decide when we will and will not be at war. I believe the version that Senator Flake and I have introduced, that was introduced in June, is a good-faith effort to listen to all and craft a compromise going forward.  I will close and say what I have said already. I think Congress should not only do this because we are constitutionally required to--and waging war without an authorization poses all kinds of legal challenges that I think are significant; that it is constitutionally required should be enough--but I actually really like the reason. I like the reason for the constitutional provision.  Madison and the Framers concluded that we should not order men and women into combat, where they are risking their lives and their health, if there is not a political consensus by the elected leadership of the country that the mission is so worth it that we can fairly ask them to risk their lives. If we are afraid to cast a vote because, oh, it is too unpopular or it could be too challenging, how can we stand up and say we are going to duck that responsibility when the consequence of war is that volunteers are being deployed and potentially injured and killed?  I will close and just say it seems to me that the sacrifice of the millions who serve Active, Guard, and Reserve--of the thousands who are deployed overseas in theaters of war right now--their sacrifice should call upon us to have a debate and do the job we are supposed to do.  If the Paul amendment passes, I look forward to working especially with my colleague from Arizona and my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee and colleagues on this floor to have a debate, have a vote, and send a strong message to terrorist groups, to our allies--but especially to our troops--that the article I branch of the U.Government has a resolve and supports them.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-09-12-pt1-PgS5198-2.txt,2176,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017.0,12.0,September

72,topic-id,391,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that would increase funding for youth employment initiatives by $10 million.  Michigan's unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, but for youth aged 16 to 24, it is more than double that, over 11 percent. Young people face high unemployment, and the lack of opportunity to find meaning in the world of work has implications that go far beyond just those years that they might find meaningful employment.  Investing in those young Americans ensures that they all do better. Providing those important employment[[Page H7278]]opportunities builds a strong foundation around the concept of hard work, and I know many Members support this effort. We just need to make sure that we find every opportunity that we can to make sure that every young person looking for an opportunity to earn a few dollars learns and, especially, understands the connection between their focus on work and the benefits that they will realize from that not only in terms of their own well-being, but the contributions they can make to their community.  Just last month, I had an opportunity to visit a really great example about how youth employment can make a positive impact in my home community. I visited a community garden run by Greg Gaines, who employs Flint area youth in summer jobs. They learn to grow crops. They learn that hard work pays off. Over time, they see these crops come in that they sell at the local farmers market. Very few of them will work in agriculture, but they come to understand that some patience and some effort and the focus on showing up on time and doing a day's good work literally and figuratively will produce fruits that they can benefit from.  So for 14- to 20-year-old kids in this program, obviously, it will make a difference in terms of the way their lives and their life trajectory goes forward, but it also sets a great example for their peers.

The Healthy Start program helps infants start out life with the support they need to grow into successful adults. It provides prenatal care, basic health needs, and promotes positive parenting practices for thousands of children.  It is especially important to the people of my hometown, as I mentioned before, and many other communities trying to work through exposure to high levels of lead, which is a neurotoxin. Of course, we know there is no cure, but the way we treat and the support we provide these youngsters often gives them a chance to overcome these sorts of developmental hurdles. Healthy Start is a critical way to do that by helping infants and their families mitigate the effects of that lead exposure.  Flint's ongoing process brought to light the nationwide issues that we face in drinking water. People are more aware of these issues and the impacts they can have on families. So it is incumbent upon us to do everything we can not just to repair the damage, but to actually help those who are struggling to get through these sorts of developmental challenges.

Lead is a dangerous neurotoxin. Its effects can be permanent, especially on very young people and those most vulnerable citizens among us.

It is one that we are still working to overcome. Even though that crisis in Flynt is no longer in the headlines, Flint and many other communities are still dealing with issues caused by exposure to lead.  There is no cure to lead exposure.

Under the Obama administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives--the ATFE--proposed a new framework for interpreting a Gun Control Act and for determining which projectiles should qualify for the sporting purpose exemption.

Now, this program did not receive funding in fiscal year `17.  Women should have access to all options when considering the impacts of an unintended pregnancy, of which one is adoption. But we should not ignore the irreplaceable role of preventing unintended pregnancy by providing education and health services.  The underlying bill limits women's access to care by prohibiting funding to the Title X Family Planning program, a program specifically created to ensure women have access to high-quality family planning services to prevent unintended pregnancies and access reproductive care services. By denying women access to comprehensive family planning and preventative health services, the bill would have a devastating impact on women and families, especially low-income women and women in rural communities.  In 2014, Title X Family Planning centers helped women avert 904,000--that is 904,000--unintended pregnancies. Without the services provided by these Title X clinics, the rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States, unplanned birth and abortion, each would have been 33 percent higher, and the teen pregnancy rate would have been 30 percent higher.  In addition, Title X providers are required to offer pregnant women the opportunity to provide information and counseling regarding all of their options--all of their options--in a neutral, nondirective, and factual manner, including adoption. For some women, adoption services and counseling may be the best option. But we must ensure that every woman has access to all options and is allowed to make the choice that is best for her and her family.  Unfortunately, this bill represents yet another missed opportunity to get serious about reproductive health and preventing unintended pregnancy in this country. This amendment uses funding from other programs in the Children and Families Services account that are critical to the well-being of children, women, and families as an offset for this new program.

863,topic-id,709,"Mr.President, I stand to support my friend Senator Rand Paul and to encourage my colleagues in the U.Senate to support his proposed amendment to the National Defense Authorization  In the Declaration of Independence, the Founding Fathers lodged the following grievance against King George III: ``He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to civil power.''  A decade later, the Founders included a safeguard in the Constitution so ``civil power''--in other words, the people and their duly elected representatives--would play an important role in matters of war and peace. The safeguard takes up all of seven words in the Constitution: ``The Congress shall have Power . . . to declare War.''  Today this safeguard--this crucial check on government--has been eroded in several ways and in ways many Americans would find downright alarming.  Congressional authorization for the use of military force is being used in a contorted way to justify wars with an ever-growing list of adversaries without any input from Congress or the American people about whether we should be fighting those wars in the first place.  Senator Paul has submitted an amendment to sunset two such authorizations: the 2001 authorization of military force against the perpetrators of 9/11, and the 2002 authorization of military force against the regime of Saddam Hussein in  I support my colleague's amendment because the world has changed and our adversaries have changed since those authorizations were passed into law by Osama bin Laden is dead. Saddam Hussein is dead. In fact, his statue in Firdos Square came down almost a decade and a half ago. Yet thousands of American troops are still serving in the Middle East based on the same authorizations Congress granted more than a decade and a half ago. Instead of changing these authorizations to reflect a changing world, politicians have used the old authorizations to start new wars in countries other than Iraq and Afghanistan against adversaries that had nothing to do with 9/11.  The 2001 AUMF has been used to justify a drone war across the Middle East without a debate or a vote in It has been used to justify air wars in Libya and Yemen without a debate or a vote in It has been used to justify military action against the Islamic State terrorist group without a debate or a vote in Some of these military actions may be justified, but the best way to determine[[Page S5209]]whether they are is to submit them to scrutiny, to debate and vote on the matter in Congress as the Constitution prescribes.  As many of you know, we are in the midst of sort of a populist challenge to Washington, Senator Paul and I have listened to countless Americans voice many of their grievances against The gist of their complaint in this area is this: They don't feel as though their interests are being taken into account in our Nation's Bit by bit, they have watched their representatives cede decisionmaking power to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch.

It applies to foreign policy as well as domestic policy, to how our government conducts itself abroad as well as at home.

They want to be represented in decisions that concern them and their sons and their daughters so intimately.

Following the massive explosion in 2010, at Upper Big Branch, which killed 29 coal miners in the worst coal mine disaster in the country in four decades, investigators found that mine management had consistently violated basic safety standards such as ventilation and rock dusting intended to prevent coal dust explosions.

This is a reasonable show of support for this important program, which saw its funding cut in half in this bill.  The Behavioral Health Workforce and Training program supports education and training for careers in behavioral health at institutions of higher education and through professional and paraprofessional training programs, with a focus on rural and medically underserved communities. This program was created as part of the 21st Century Cures Act in response to the significant nationwide shortage of behavioral health providers.  According to SAMHSA, 55 percent of U.counties do not have a practicing behavioral health provider, and 77 percent of counties reported unmet behavioral health needs. These statistics would be alarming at any time, but they are particularly concerning in the midst of a national opioid epidemic.  A 2016 Surgeon General's Report found that only 10 percent of people with a substance abuse disorder receive any type of specialty treatment. Additionally, 60 percent of adults with a mental illness didn't receive mental health services in the previous year.  This lack of access to services has severe consequences for the individuals seeking treatment, their families, and[[Page H7283]]our communities. When they don't have access to treatment, individuals with behavioral health needs receive a whole different set of services. Jails and sometimes emergency rooms become the de facto behavioral health system.

I am thankful to the chairman for the funding amount already provided for in this bill, but I am hopeful that we can go one step further and fully fund this program again in the coming fiscal year.  The Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program improves healthcare for older Americans by providing clinical training opportunities to students, medical faculty and providers, direct service workers, patients, families, and caregivers that integrate geriatric and primary care delivery systems.  In the 2015-2016 academic year, grantees provided training to 18,451 students and fellows participating in a variety of geriatrics-focused degree programs, field placements, and fellowships. Of these trainees, 11,824 graduated or completed their training during the most recent academic year, and grantees partnered with 365 hospitals, long-term care facilities, and academic institutions to provide clinical training experiences to trainees.  America's population is aging, and it is imperative that new generations of healthcare professionals and providers have the skills needed to care for older Every person in this Chamber at some point in their life will wish their healthcare provider had this training.

The path we are on is not sustainable. It jeopardizes our future, our children's future, and our national security. We must get our fiscal house in order and take this problem seriously.  Paying lip service to the problem will not solve it. We must be responsible now before it is too late. The reality is that we can make cuts to the size and cost of our Federal Government without impacting essential programs. In fact, the right cuts will allow our economy to grow by stopping overeager bureaucrats who seem to believe everything should be regulated until it no longer functions.  We in Congress need to be focused on growing and protecting Main Street, not protecting an already bloated Federal Government and bureaucracy. The amendment I propose today is simple. It makes a cut to the bureaucracy of several offices of division F relating to Labor, Health and Human My amendment cuts funds from the same Department of Labor that gave us the overtime rule and the persuader rule. This is an agency of bureaucrats that wishes to legislate through regulation.  My amendment puts forth a modest 10 percent reduction of administrative expenses, which would save taxpayers $351 million annually on Labor and HHS alone. Let me restate that: We can actually save $351 million annually by just cutting administrative costs.  We, in fact, may well find the money to put the additional $10 million into youth employment services if we cut our bureaucracy.  I come from a world of privacy business, so I understand that fiscal responsibility starts on a small scale and requires commitment to changing the trend. My amendment, when combined with similar measures across all appropriations, will yield big savings to taxpayers, and will do so without cutting projects or essential programs that we hold dear.

Mr.Speaker, as I stand in support of this legislation, it is important to acknowledge that it not only addresses the needs of the residents who are cleaning up after Harvey, but it ensures that we will also avoid a first-ever default on the full faith and credit of the United                              {time}  1000  What is important about this moment is the following: We are adhering to what is known as the national principle, and the national principle means that, if there is an earthquake in California, we rise to the aid of the people of If there is a hurricane in Texas, we rise to the aid of the people in If there is a tornado in Springfield, Massachusetts, as there was a few years ago, we all come to the aid of the people of Springfield, If there were horrific forest fires in the State of Alabama, as happened a few years ago, we all come to the aid of the people of  Now, why is that important? Because we don't check gender, and we don't check race, and we don't say: Is it a blue State or a red State or what is the political affiliation of those who are affected?  Instead, we say: The national principle ensures that this is about the American family in moments of great challenge and great difficulty, and we don't use the opportunity to remind people of what the budget might look like at that moment. Instead, we come to their assistance and we figure out how to pay for it later on.  So on this occasion, there is a very important consideration that is married, and it includes the idea that, with the Trump administration and congressional Republicans and Democrats on this side, we are going to not only do what we are supposed to do in terms of raising the national debt, but we will come to the assistance of members of the American family, as I, a moment ago, described.  Now, let me point out something else as well. We need to stop playing games with the national debt limit. We had tax cuts here in 2001 and 2003 that cut Federal revenue to 15 percent of gross domestic product, despite the fact that the historic postwar norm average is closer to 17.5 percent. Actually, in some of those years before that, it rose to 18.5 cents on the dollar--a reasonable expenditure. But instead, as those numbers slipped to 15 percent, the argument became somehow that it was about future payments.  The argument over the debt limit is about expenses incurred, what we have obligated ourselves to with veterans benefits, a war in Afghanistan, a war in And even though I voted against the war in Iraq, we need to come to the aid of those veterans and those veterans hospitals, and we need to come to the assistance of those 1 million new veterans who were created because of it. And again, not asking questions, is it a blue State expenditure? is it a red State expenditure? It is about the national principle.  The idea that we would cast doubt on the full faith and credit of the United States to earn a few political points and to try to convince people that this is about future spending, it is not about future spending. This is about the credit card having come due for, in most instances, reasonable expenditures, not the least of which includes the obligations we have to Social Security, Medicare, and our senior citizens.  So this agreement that we have rendered today is a reasonable and sensible bipartisan achievement, and we should use this as an example and as a template for what we might do going forward to address many of the challenges that are going to confront the American people.  And be assured of this: Whether it is in Florida or it is in Houston, the expenditure requirements here are going to bulge, and we should not be dismissive of that. So raise the debt limit and come to the aid of the American family today.  ",CREC-2017-09-08-pt1-PgH7191.txt,854,PATHWAYS TO IMPROVING HOMELAND SECURITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ACT,2017.0,8.0,September

Those extra funds will make an enormous difference in battling lung cancer, which is, as you all know, the most deadly of all the cancers.                              {time}  1815  As many of you know, my daughter, Katherine, was diagnosed with stage IV nonsmoking small cell lung cancer almost 2 years ago. Thanks to medical research and the daily prayers of so many of my colleagues here in the House, Katherine is still with us.  But like so many thousands of others, she is still courageously and desperately fighting for her future. We can provide those people with some real hope and support for their determination through additional research dollars that are so desperately needed.  As you know--or may not know--we have made little or no progress in the last 20 years in combating lung cancer. There is still a survival rate of something less than 1 or 2 percent.  But make no mistake, the money that this committee and this Congress and this House has provided for research not just in cancer, but many of the other fields, has played a critically important role in increasing our life expectancies--played the lead role in increasing our life expectancies in this country. In my grandfather's time it was 47, and now it is almost 80.  But one of the areas where we just haven't been able to make any progress at all is in lung cancer research. Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this modest request for a modest amount of money to be added to helping us make some progress in lung cancer research in the way that we have done for so many other forms of the disease.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Chair, I rise today to seek support for amendment 77 to H.3354, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, which is supported by the Taxpayers Protection Alliance and key voted by the National Taxpayers Union, Club for Growth, Heritage Action for America, and  Mick Mulvaney, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been guided by the idea that every dollar spent by the Federal Government must be scrutinized. I took this principle to heart as I examined the President's budget request, which stated: ``Everyone believes in and supports safe food supplies and clean air and water. But the agencies of the Federal Government have gone way beyond what was intended by the Congress.''  Madam Chair, while traveling around my district this August, I heard the same sentiment put more plainly: ``Washington is off the rails.''  As our national debt grows in excess of $20 trillion, each of my 15 grandchildren is being saddled with a $61,000 share of the debt. Now, Madam Chair, my 16th grandchild is on the way. I would really like to start tackling Washington's spending problems now before grandchild 16 joins us in early  I am encouraged by the leadership of President Trump's administration with its budget request, but I strongly believe Congress must do its part to stop this debt from crushing our That is why I have submitted an amendment that would reduce EPA appropriations by $1.869 billion to the administration's requested level of $5.655 billion.  In his testimony to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt emphasized the need for the EPA to get back to the basics of statutory authority of ensuring access to clean water, clean air, and land.  Madam Chair, the amount of overreach and wasteful spending the EPA is responsible for is endless. Allow me to share with you a few recent examples.  For overreach: first, look to Sackett v. EPA, where the EPA imposed $75,000 cost per day on a couple for placing gravel on dry land to build a home within the existing subdivision.  And then there is Andy Johnson, the Wyoming rancher who was facing $20 million in fines for his stock pond, which the EPA alleged violated the Clean Water This is despite the fact that stock ponds were exempt from Federal law, and that he had obtained the necessary permits. It took Mr.Johnson 5 months in court to reach a winning settlement which freed him from any obligation to pay the  The waters of the United States rule, which I am happy to see this administration working to roll back, embodied the overreach perfectly, as the Obama EPA pushed the limits of its power under the Clean Water Act to even regulate some ponds and manmade ditches.  Now, for wasteful spending: there is an Environmental Justice Program, a program that is supposed to support business development in disadvantaged communities, which funded an effort to increase knowledge of environmentally-friendly nail salon practices in California nail salons.                              {time}  1145  The estimated price tag was $73 million over the course of 2016-2025.  There was an EPA environmental education program which funded ``educational projects'' that have included learning how to build rain gardens, the significance of urban forests, poster contests on sun protection, asthma awareness and radon and schoolyard habitat restoration.  There was even $300,000 in grant money going to fund the Chesapeake Bay Journal, an environmental newspaper in  Madam Chair, these are just a handful of recent instances of the EPA's bureaucratic waste at the expense of the American taxpayer.  The Presidential budget request for the EPA provides the roadmap for trimming the Agency back to focus on its core mission. Funding for the Agency is focused on infrastructure, elimination of duplicative programs and programs that extend past the EPA's statutory authority, and ensuring that funds are not lost to bureaucratic waste.

574,topic-id,443,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My amendment prohibits the Federal Bureau of Prisons from using Federal funds to carry out a law that requires individuals in halfway houses or on home confinement to pay a subsistence fee.  Currently, the subsistence fee for residents of halfway houses is 25 percent of income. This criminal justice reform amendment would improve reentry and reduce recidivism among the Nation's returning citizens.  Out of prison and almost always without a job or ability to support themselves, returning citizens have no ability to pay counterproductive subsistence fees while in halfway houses or on home confinement any more than they could have paid for their subsistence while in prison.  For the limited time individuals spend in halfway houses--up to 12 months--or on home confinement--up to 6 months--the subsistence fee requirement is a substantial burden on them and de minimis on the BOP, witness that the Congressional Budget Office concluded that this amendment would have no budgetary effect.  If returning citizens are lucky enough to find work at all, it would almost certainly be in minimum wage jobs. So the loss of 25 percent of their paychecks to subsistence fees would be a significant hurdle to successful reentry--which is what we are after--[[Page H7267]]making it extremely difficult to pay rent, child support, or fines and fees associated with their conviction, such as restitution.  Far from promoting financial responsibility, subsistence fees, while in custody, actually prevent returning citizens from meeting their financial obligations. Congress surely did not mean to impose additional burdens on returning citizens, setting them up to fail. Jobs and affordable housing are crucial to reentry but rare for returning citizens. Charging subsistence fees is antithetical to these goals.  The Department of Justice itself has recommended eliminating this fee. A November 2016 DOJ memorandum recommended developing a plan to limit the use of ``counterproductive `subsistence' fees imposed on indigent residents.''  It further stated:       The Bureau of Prisons' process for collecting these      subsistence fees is costly and administratively burdensome on      both halfway houses and the And these fees make it      difficult for residents who typically earn minimum wage, if      anything, to meet their other financial obligations,      including restitution fines and child support.                              {time}  1545  The BOP already eliminated subsistence fees for individuals on home confinement, but that is only by regulation. However it was a step in the right direction.  My amendment would continue this trend and eliminate the fees for those in halfway houses as well. My amendment provides a critical reform that would help improve reentry and reduce recidivism.  Mr.Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

DACA recipients are contributing members of our society, have no criminal record, and have known only this country as home. They work at leading American companies. They have served our country in the military.  On the day of the President's decision, I met with several young people at Rutgers University in my district who may now face deportation. I was impressed by their courage in coming forward to tell their stories and to challenge the President's reckless action.  Some examples: Yeimi, a 17-year-old from Freehold, left Mexico when she was 1 year old. She said at the meeting I had: ``I do want to become something in life, because that is why I am here. I do not want this dream to be shattered because DACA, apparently, is going to be killed.''

I thank as well Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Burgess, and Mr.Green for helping to shepherd our bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee and onto the floor day.  As co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus and lead Democratic sponsor of this bill, I am proud to stand up for the brave men and women of our fire service. It is these individuals who put their lives on the line day in and day out to keep our communities safe.  In addition to ensuring that our first responders are prepared in advance of disasters and other emergencies, we must also ensure that they receive the necessary medical care and services after answering the call of duty.  When the courageous men and women in the fire services enter dangerous situations, they do not stop to ask whether they are subjecting themselves to long-term health risks.  Yesterday, across this Nation, we honored the first responders that answered the call of duty after the terrorists attacked us on September 11. Many of those brave men and women gave their lives, and many more are living with long-term health problems stemming from the time they spent at toxic Ground  As evidenced on that day, many before and since, our first responders do whatever is necessary to keep our communities safe. That is why we must have their backs.  While we know that firefighters are routinely exposed to a variety of known carcinogens in chaotic and uncontrolled environments, we do not have a good sense of the full picture of the negative impacts of the exposure.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, firefighters are at higher risk for certain kinds of cancer, including brain cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, and kidney cancer, when compared with the general population.  Despite the knowledge we have gained through these studies, many have been limited by small sample sizes and an underrepresentation of key demographic groups.  The first step to finding solutions is understanding the nature of the problem. Further public health research on this topic is needed so we can start working to find ways to alleviate this risk.  I am pleased that H.931 is on the floor today. It would create a national cancer registry for firefighters diagnosed with this deadly disease. The creation of a specialized firefighter cancer registry will provide scientists and medical professionals with the detailed national data that will allow them to study the relationships between firefighters' exposure to dangerous fumes and harmful toxins and the increased risk for several major cancers. In the future, this information could also allow for better protective equipment and prevention techniques to be developed.

Despite the fact that this vital program helps ensure that we have enough cops on the beat in our communities, the House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bills have cut or eliminated funding for the COPS Hiring Program since the Republicans took control of this House in 2011.  So every year, Representative Dave Reichert and I, co-chairs of the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus, come to the floor to offer an amendment to shift funding back to the COPS Hiring Program to show support for local police hiring programs. We do this dance every year, but no one seems to learn their lesson, because here we are again with a bill that zeros out funding for this program.  Our amendments pass with overwhelming support, often by voice vote. The Senate sees this strong support and ends up funding the program in the final appropriations package. In fact, both the Senate and President have proposed funding the COPS program at $207 million.  Typically, we have regular order in the House when considering appropriations bills. That means we would have an open rule to allow us to offer any amendment to shift funds in this bill.

NAPO is very concerned that H.3354 does not provide      funding for the COPS Hiring This vital program has      assisted more than 13,000 jurisdictions with over $14 billion      in funding to hire more than 127,000 community police      officers across the United A big part of the success      of the original program was its reliance on local police      agencies in defining what their communities needed. In      addition to the hiring and retention of much needed officers,      this funding program has contributed to continued success in      combating crime, drug use, and gangs; reducing and preventing      the manufacture, distribution, and use of illegal drugs;      promoting officer safety and wellness; and addressing      emerging law enforcement needs.

A large part of this success was the      nation's commitment to community oriented policing,      particularly its hiring component which helped get more      officers on the beat. Community oriented policing has been      the cornerstone of our nation's policing strategy for nearly      25 years and the hiring program is the reason this strategy      works.       However, today, we have less police on our streets and      neighborhoods than we did even a decade ago, making the      community policing strategy very difficult to pursue. It is      no surprise to our profession that crime, particularly      violent crime, is on the rise. There are less men and women      policing our streets, keeping the peace and interacting      positively with the communities they protect. If we are      serious about stemming the rise in crime and if we remain      committed to the community policing strategy, then we must      continue to fund the COPS hiring program.

854,topic-id,4436,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose unauthorized, undeclared, and unconstitutional war. What we have today is basically unlimited war, anywhere, anytime, anyplace upon the globe.  My amendment would sunset in 6 months the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of force. What does that mean? This was legislation passed many years ago to go after the people who attacked us on 9/11. I supported that battle, but I think the mission is long since over. I don't think anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty believes these authorizations from 16 years ago and 14 years ago--I don't think anyone with intellectual honesty believes they authorized war in seven different countries.  Not only is it lives we are losing, the American soldiers, the brave young men and women who are sent to distant lands and asked to give their lives for their country without the Senate taking the time to authorize the war--I think that is terribly unjust and should end.  There are some who argue that we don't even need to vote at all. Some of the Presidents, Republican and Democratic, have said they have article II--this is the second article of the Constitution--they say that by the Constitution, they can do what they want, when they want, where they want, and that Congress never has to approve their authorization and never has to give authority to go to war. These advocates of perpetual war argue that these powers are implicit and that no one can stop a President who wants to go to war.  This is diametrically opposite of what our Founding Fathers thought. Madison in particular disagreed. Madison wrote that the executive branch is the branch most prone to go to war; therefore, the Constitution, with studied care, vested that power in the Our Founding Fathers saw the[[Page S5199]]history of Europe as the perpetual history of war--brothers fighting brothers, Kings of two different countries who were cousins, brothers, uncles, fathers, sons. The history of Europe was perpetual war.  When we broke away, we said: We are going to have some checks and balances in place. We are going to make it difficult to go to war. We are going to vest that power in the  But somewhere along the way, we lost our way, and we now commit ourselves to war or one man or one woman commits us to war without any vote by This is not what our Founding Fathers intended.  Former President Obama, when he was a candidate, wrote that no President should unilaterally go to war unless we were under imminent attack. That is the understanding of the Constitution that most originalists take. Yet, once Mr.Obama was in the White House, he bombed seven different countries. He expanded the use of Executive power. He expanded the war-making power of the Presidency, even while all along saying that he was for a narrower interpretation.  Candidate Trump said that the war in Afghanistan had lost its purpose, that it was a disaster, and that it should end. He said that on maybe 15 different occasions. Yet, now that he is in the White House, the generals have said: We must fight on. We must continue to fight. If we leave, the Taliban will take over.  My question is, When will the Afghans stand up and fight? We have spent $1 trillion helping them. We spent billions of dollars trying to convince them not to grow the poppy that becomes the opium that addicts the world. Yet last year Afghanistan had the biggest crop of poppy they have ever had in recent history. The people who run Afghanistan, whom we put in to govern, the Karzai family--full of drug dealers, crooks, and thieves. You wonder why they are not popular in their own country. But my question is, Where did the $1 trillion go? Why can't they defend themselves? Why do we have to fight their wars for them?  One thing is certain: The war was not authorized by you, the people, and the war was not authorized by us, the Congress, and therefore the war is unconstitutional. The war is unauthorized.  You say: Well, do we ever get it right? Have we ever voted to authorize war?  Yes, we have. When we went to war in Afghanistan the first time--and I would have voted yes--there was a vote, and overwhelmingly we voted to go in.  Some have argued: Well, is 6 months enough time for Congress to do anything? Can they get anything done in 6 months?  When we were attacked in Pearl Harbor, do you know how long it took us to declare war? Twenty-four hours. When we were attacked on 9/11, how long did it take us to authorize the military force to go in? Three days. People say Congress will never get it done. Maybe it is because we are divided.  We haven't been attacked, we have no clear purpose in Afghanistan, and there is no clear route to victory. Realize that in 2011 President Obama put 100,000 troops into Sure, he pushed the Taliban back. Where did they go? To our ally Pakistan, which has gotten billions and billions of dollars of American welfare and as we sit here is destined to get another half a million of your money in American welfare over the next month. Billions and billions of dollars we send to Pakistan, but where does the Taliban live? In They run back and forth across the border.  So we have to ask the question, What is our purpose? Are we nation building? We spend hundreds of billions of dollars building their roads, building their bridges, building their schools. They bomb them, we bomb them--somebody bombs them, and then we rebuild them again.  We have $150 billion worth of damage in Do you know how we should pay for it? Let's quit sending welfare to foreign countries. Let's look at our country first, the problems we have here, rebuild our roads, our bridges, our schools, and not borrow it, not add to a $20 trillion debt. Take the money we are sending in welfare to foreign countries and let's rebuild our own.  We are at war in seven countries--none of them voted on by Is it expensive? Yes, to the tune of trillions of dollars.  Today we will debate the issue of war and whether Congress is constitutionally bound to declare war. We will debate whether one generation can bind another generation to perpetual war.  We are at the point where we have been in Afghanistan so long that within the next year, there will be people fighting who were not yet born on 9/11. This war no longer has anything to do with 9/11, no longer has anything to do with any vital interest in our country. It has to do with us believing we could reshape the world and make the world safe for democracy--everyone is going to love America, and everyone is going to become a western style democracy. Guess what? It is never going to happen.  Afghanistan is not even a real country; it is a collection of five or six tribal lands that were stuck together by Europeans who had no knowledge of the local people. They don't even like each other, much less us. Do you know what they call the President, who resides in Kabul? They call him the mayor of Kabul derisively because he has no sway over them. They are interested in who their chieftain is in their local area. They speak five different languages. They are never going to be a country.  If you want to be at war there, you want to send your sons and daughters to Afghanistan, you think somehow it will make our country safer, let's vote on it. So what I am advocating is a vote. For the first time in 16 years, I am advocating that we should vote on whether we should be at war. It should be a simple vote, but it is like pulling teeth. I have been trying very hard to get this vote for 5 years now. I am this close. I am hoping to get the vote today or tomorrow, but it isn't easy because we have been obstructing and obstructing, and no one wants to be on the line. Yet that is why we are elected--to put our names, our John Hancock, on the line. Are you for the war or against the war?  I am done. I am done. I am ready to come home. I remember my father saying, in 2008, in one of the Presidential debates, when they asked ``How will you get the people home?'' he said ``We just marched in, and we can just march out.''  There is no more meaning or purpose in We had 100,000 troops there in 2011. All of the Taliban scurried into Pakistan, and as soon as the troops diminished, they went back. Some people take from that lesson--they say: We need 200,000 or we need half a million troops or we need to stay there forever and police every corner for them. I take it to mean that the governments themselves over there do not have the popular support of the people.  Stand up and fight for your country. Half of the people in Afghanistan who were helping us over there came to our country. They fled. It is the same with All of the good people in Iraq--our translators, pro-Western people--came to our country. I understand wanting to come to a good place, but it would be like having the people who signed the Declaration of Independence, after they had fought the war and America had won, going back to England and saying: Oh, it is dangerous in the new country. Yet that is what we have been saying year after year, so the people who have pro-Western values from Afghanistan now live in the United States and the same in  The thing is that we need to have some tough love. They need to practice some responsibility, and they need to take ownership of their country. But as long as you coddle people, as long as you give people stuff, and as long as you fight their wars for them, they are not going to step up and fight.  We are going to debate whether Afghanistan is a winnable war.  We will also debate whether war in Yemen is in our national interest. Most of America does not know that we are at war in Most of America does not know where Yemen is. We need to know why we are there and whether it is of any value to the United  We will debate whether our support for Saudi Arabia is exacerbating starvation and the plague of cholera in  We will debate whether it is in our national interest to topple the Government of There are 2 million[[Page S5200]]Christians who live in Guess what. We may not understand it, but most of those Christians support On the side of the war that we have been funding and arming with the radical Islamists from Saudi Arabia and with the radical Islamists from Qatar are the people who hate the We are fighting on the side of the people who hate the Christians in Does that make Assad a good guy? No, but the thing is that maybe sometimes there is no good person in a war, no good side to a war.  For 5 years, I have been fighting to have a vote on whether we should be at war and where. I think there is no greater responsibility for a legislator than to vote on when we go to war. I tell the young soldiers whom I meet that it is my responsibility to discuss, debate, and think seriously about whether we send them to war.  One of the things that is most mistaken by politicians--even by some who are well intended--is that they think every soldier in America is jumping up and down to go to his eighth tour in Go out and meet the soldiers. They are not allowed to be politically active, and they are not a political force on Washington, but I guarantee that if you were to ask our soldiers ``Are you ready to go back for your eighth tour of Afghanistan? Do you see purpose in Afghanistan?'' that they have lost sight of what that purpose is.  I met a Navy SEAL about a year ago. He had been in for 19 years--a tough guy, as they all are--and he said to me: Do you know what? We can defeat any enemy. We can kill any enemy. We can succeed at almost any mission that you give us. But the mistake is when you--Congress or a President--tell us to go somewhere and plant the flag and create a country. We are just not very good at nation building.  We have the world's most elite military. We can defend our country. We can defend, without question, against all invaders. Yet we are not very good at making countries out of places that are not.  What we should think about is that we have a $20 trillion debt. We borrow $1 million a minute. Even if you thought it was a good idea to try to create a country in Iraq or create a country in Afghanistan or create some sort of paradise in Yemen or Somalia or Nigeria or Libya or any of the places we are--even if you thought some paradise was a great thing--we have no money with which to do it. We are destroying our country from within. We are eating out the substance of the very greatness of America by borrowing $1 million a minute. We are flat broke. We cannot afford to be everybody's Uncle We cannot afford to be everybody's Uncle We cannot afford to keep exporting our money and our jobs to the rest of the world. We need to look at our country and say it is time that we did things for our country, for our people, and it is time that we quit borrowing $1 million a minute.  The question is, Will the Senators--will those who gather to vote--stand for the rule of law? Will the Senators stand for congressional authority for war? Will they stand for what the Constitution clearly says in article I, section 8, which is that Congress, not the President, shall declare war? Will the Senators sit idly by and let the wars continue unabated and unauthorized?  Some will argue that sunsetting the old authorizations is too soon, too dramatic. Really? So 6 months and 16 years later, we have not decided whether we should be at war or where we should be, and we cannot decide in 6 months? It took us 24 hours to decide with Pearl It took us 3 days to decide with 9/11. I think 6 months is more than enough time.  Will Congress do its job unless it is forced to? All history says no. Why does Congress have an 11-percent approval rating from the people? Because it is not doing its job. How do we force Congress to do its job? Give it deadlines. How can we get a deadline? Let's pass this. Let's let the authorizations expire. Let's have a full-throated, deep, and heartfelt debate over whether we should be at war and where. Should we be at war in Afghanistan? Is there a winnable and foreseeable winnable future there? Should we be at war in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Libya?  Today's vote can be seen as a proxy vote for the Today's vote is not really a vote for or against any particular war. Today's vote is simply a vote on whether we will obey the Today's vote is a vote on whether Congress will step up and do its job. Sixteen-and-a-half years is more than enough time to determine whether the war in Afghanistan or Yemen or Libya or Somalia has purpose or real meaning for our national security.  Often, it is said--very glibly--that, yes, it is in our national security interest. Realize when people tell you that they are giving you a conclusion. That is the beginning of the debate. We could debate for hours and hours. Hopefully, we will have some of that debate, but we have to debate what is in our vital national interest. Just to say it is so does not make it so.  Does anybody in America think the war in Yemen is in our vital interest? Most people do not know where Yemen is, much less think it is in our vital interest. Guess what. The war in Yemen may actually be opposed to our vital national interest. It may be making it worse. The war in Libya certainly did.  President Obama, when he chose to act illegally and intervene in Libya, made the world less safe. It was not his intention. I will grant him that his motives were to make it more safe, but he made the world less safe. Why? Because when Qadhafi was toppled, you got chaos. You have two competing governments in Libya, and you have chaos. If you want to set up a terrorist camp, if you are ready to go find a good place in the world, Libya is one of the prime places to go now because the government is gone and there is chaos. So I would argue that the intervention--one of the wars that we fought illegally, without the approval of the Senate, under the unilateral action of the President--made us less safe. That is why we are supposed to debate before we go to war. We are less safe because of the Libyan war.  How about the Syrian war? It is the Christians on one side and us on the other side. That is the first problem I have. The people on the side of the war that we supported are the radical ISIS was on the side that we were supporting. In fact, one of the most famous, if not the most famous and important leaked email about Hillary Clinton from WikiLeaks was when Hillary Clinton sent an email to John Podesta, writing to him: Hmm, we need to exert some influence on Saudi Arabia and Qatar because they are giving financial and strategic assistance to  Realize that. Of the people we are selling weapons to in Saudi Arabia and Qatar--they get all of their weapons from us--guess who they are giving them to. They were on the same side as  Let's say you do not believe that. You say: Oh, I don't believe that. Certainly we would not have done that because we would not have supported the bad people.  Let's say we just supported the so-called moderates. They are still fighting against the guys who are protecting the  What was the net effect of the Syrian civil war? Before we got involved, Assad was winning the war. Once again, like Qadhafi, he is not a great guy, but he does defend the Christians, and the Christians do support him. We turned the tide of the war by flowing in hundreds and hundreds of tons of weapons in 2013--us, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia--but these weapons went in indiscriminantly. What happened when we turned the tide of the war? Chaos in a vacuum. In that vacuum, guess who arose.  When you created chaos in Libya by fighting an unconstitutional, unauthorized war, you got more terrorism, more chaos, and the world was a less safe place.  When we got involved in Syria without the authorization of Congress--unconstitutional, unauthorized--what did you get? Chaos and the rise of  What do we have in Yemen right now? In Yemen, you have a Sunni-backed government in exile that is supported by the Saudis, and you have these Houthi rebels who are supported by But that is not all you have in You also have al-Qaida of the Arab Peninsula--three different groups. It is said that al-Qaida of the Arab Peninsula is actually the strongest remaining presence of al-Is it possible, in our supporting the Saudi[[Page S5201]]Arabian-backed government against the Houthis, that they fight and kill each other to such a degree of chaos that al-Qaida of the Arab Peninsula fills the vacuum? If you look at Libya, that is what happened. If you look at Syria, that is what happened. What if it happens in Yemen?  You have to ask, what is our vital interest in Yemen? Why are we in Yemen? Why are we supplying bombs to the Saudis? Is it somehow making us safer from terrorism? Are we killing them over there so they do not kill us over here? Guess what. We may be creating more terrorists than we can possibly kill.  The Saudis bombed a funeral procession of civilians. They killed 150 people, and they wounded 500. Do you think they are ever going to forget about it? That is going to be passed down through oral tradition for a thousand years, and they will talk about the day that the Saudis came and bombed civilians. They will also say in the next breath: Guess who gave them the bombs. The Guess who helped to guide the planes. Guess who refueled the planes in the air. The Americans refueled the Saudis the day that they came to bomb a funeral procession.  So, in the end, we killed 150 people. You might say: Well, they were all bad people. They were at the funeral of a bad person. Do you think that we killed 150 and that will be the end of it, or do you think that those who were wounded, who survived and went back to their villages, told every one of their neighbors and everyone in the village about the day the Saudis came with the American bombs?  We have to ask ourselves, are we making things better? Is Yemen in our vital national interest? Are we making things better or are we making things worse? Is there a possibility that it will lead to such chaos that al-Qaida of the Arab Peninsula will rise up and become a real threat to us?  What else is happening in Yemen? It is one of the poorest countries on the planet, as 17 million people, as we speak, live on the edge of starvation--17 million people. They are having the largest outbreak of cholera. Where is most of this happening? Where is most of the starvation, most of the killing, and most of the cholera? It is in the areas that are being bombed by the They have bombed the infrastructure into ruins, and there is no clean water, so cholera is spreading.  War is probably the most common and most important precipitating factor in humanitarian disasters. If you look at humanitarian disasters around the world, you will find that the 1 cause is war, and Yemen was already a poor place to begin with.  You are fighting the war, and nobody asked your permission. You are fighting a war in Yemen through the proxy of Saudi Arabia, and no one has asked my permission. This is a grave insult to us. It is dangerous to the Treasury, but it is also your sons and daughters who are being asked to go to Yemen now.  We had a manned raid in Yemen and lost one of our Navy I have asked what we got, and they just sort of push me off and say, oh, they might tell me on another occasion. No one will tell me what we got. They claim that it was great, that it was the best stuff you could ever find, that it is going to prevent loss of life. But the thing is, we have no business in We have not voted to go to war in We have been at war 16 years--the longest war now--in There is no purpose left. There is no future for the war in  Today's vote will be remembered as the first vote--if we have it--in 16 years on whether to continue fighting everywhere, all the time, without ever having to renew the authorization of I hope Senators will think long and hard about the seven ongoing wars and, at the very least, show regard for our young soldiers and go on the record to uphold their oath of office. Each Senator should uphold their oath of office and defend the Constitution and its requirements with regard to war.  I, for one, will stand with soldiers, young and brave, sent to fight in distant lands in a forgotten, forever war. I will stand for the I will stand with our Founding Fathers, who did everything possible to make the initiation of war difficult.  I hope my colleagues will stand for something. I hope my colleagues will finally vote to do their constitutional duty and oversee and/or discontinue the many wars we are in. But even if my colleagues say: War, war--that is the answer--everywhere, all the time, by golly, come down and put your name on it. If you think we should be at war in Afghanistan, vote for it. If you think we should be at war in Yemen, come down to the floor and vote for it.  What does everybody do? Pass the buck. Let the President do it. Let the President take the blame if things don't go well. We should vote. So on my amendment, you will probably see that the majority will say: We don't want any responsibility; let the President take care of that.  My vote isn't actually directly on any of the wars, although I do oppose most of the wars we are involved in. My vote is on whether or not we should vote on whether we should be at war.  So for those who oppose my vote, they oppose the They oppose obeying the Constitution, which says that we are supposed to vote. They are going to say: No, I refuse to vote on any of these wars.  All my amendment does is to sunset an authorization that really doesn't apply to anything we are doing at the moment, and it says that in 6 months' time, you have to come up with an authority to go to war. I hope my colleagues will stand for something. I hope they will finally vote to do their constitutional duty. It is the least we can do to honor the service of our brave young soldiers.

Mr.Speaker, 16 years ago, an unprecedented attack against the United States revealed immense gaps in how the United States approached domestic security and information sharing. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate 22 existing Federal agencies and reshape the domestic intelligence and counterterrorism structure in the United  Over the years, DHS has matured and refined its Intelligence Enterprise, or what we know as DHS Even now, however, the Department has struggled to fully unify the various intelligence offices within the component agencies.

DHS needs to follow the model of many other members of the intelligence community and produce an intelligence doctrine that clearly articulates roles and priorities across the DHS Intelligence The lack of this internal structure reflects a painful legacy from the pre-9/11 era in which bureaucracies operated as silos and were poorly coordinated.  H.2468 empowers DHS to address this continued failure. By requiring the Department to produce guidance to all its components on the processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of information and intelligence, this bill helps to professionalize the DHS Intelligence Such a doctrine will guide how operational information from across DHS is incorporated into a wider strategic Homeland Security picture. This will increase the use of Department-specific information in its analytic products and processes.  H.2468 also takes another step in strengthening the Department's Intelligence Enterprise by formalizing the Department's existing support for the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, or the Though the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, or the I&A, serves as the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer, these two roles carry different statutory authorities and distinct missions.  Therefore, Congress should support both functions by authorizing staff support for the H.2468 does not authorize new hiring but, rather, reauthorizes the Department's existing staff assignment and, most importantly, makes those assignments permanent.  It is now time to hold the Department accountable for developing a common foundation among members of the Department's Intelligence By requiring DHS to produce these guidelines and by ensuring the Department's leadership is properly and reliably supported, H.2468 helps us to work to fulfill the promises made to the American people 16 years ago: Never again.  I am very pleased the text of H.2468 was included in the larger DHS authorization bill, which passed this very House in I urge my colleagues to support the standalone measure to improve the quality of DHS' analytical[[Page H7242]]products and help the Department better serve the intelligence community and its State and local partners.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2468, the Unifying DHS Intelligence Enterprise Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this measure seeks to help safeguard our Nation's homeland security information. Specifically, it requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop and distribute Departmentwide guidance on the proper procedures for handling and sharing information related to homeland security and terrorism.  The 9/11 Commission Report found that the U.Government did not fully share or pool intelligence information prior to the attacks. In response, policies and procedures were reformed at all levels to ensure that critical national security information is properly shared.  Intelligence sharing is critical to terrorism prevention, but it must be carried out in a manner that ensures that sensitive information is properly handled and distributed. H.2468 seeks to do just that.  The bill requires the establishment of rules and regulations for the dissemination of such information both within DHS and with homeland security stakeholders at the State and local levels as well as in the private sector.  I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, H.2468 has strong support on both sides of the aisle. Effective security measures to improve our intelligence systems and mechanisms are critical to the mission of protecting the homeland.  I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Perry) for his work on this important legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act introduced by the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) is an important measure targeting new ways terrorists may be raising or transferring funds through the use of virtual currencies.  The bill directs the DHS Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, in coordination with Federal partners, to develop and disseminate a threat assessment regarding the actual and potential threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. It also directs the Under Secretary to share this threat assessment with State, local, and Tribal law enforcement officials through the National Network of Fusion  As the threat of terrorism evolves, so do the methods to finance and support the actors who plot to attack the United The Federal Government must evolve as well to meet these novel and technologically-based challenges.

This measure was considered by the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence and included in the Committee on Homeland Security's DHS authorization bill, which passed this very House in  I want to take time to thank the gentlewoman for her work and for her diligence on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support her bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.2433, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies  Yesterday marked 16 years since the September 11 attacks when 19 terrorists hijacked four passenger planes, two of which struck the World Trade Center towers in my home State of New  In the 16 years since the deadliest terrorist attack in American history, the United States has led the global campaign to combat terrorism, thwarting plots and preventing attacks on American soil, identifying and disrupting terrorist networks around the world, hunting down terrorists wherever they hide, and proving that they can and will be brought to justice.  We know that the threat of terrorism is not the same as it was 16 years ago. It is a threat that constantly evolves, and we need to evolve ahead of it. That is why I introduced H.2433.  In recent years, we have seen instances in which members of some terrorist groups have turned to virtual currencies to support themselves and fund their operations. Last year, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies investigated a terrorist funding campaign in which a terrorist group in the Gaza Strip received donations to the virtual currency bitcoin. Earlier this year, Indonesian authorities reported that a Syria-based Indonesian with ties[[Page H7243]]to ISIL used virtual currency to fund attacks in  Virtual currencies offer high-speed and low-cost networks and access to users all over the world, which creates significant potential appeal to terrorists, particularly lone-wolf attackers because of the nominal cost often associated with carrying out that type of attack.  Research suggests that terrorists' use of virtual currencies have so far been limited to a handful of instances, two of which I have mentioned. But with groups like ISIL becoming more technologically sophisticated and virtual currencies becoming more widely accessible, the table is set for this threat to grow significantly in a very short time. That is why it is critical that we act now to assess and understand this emerging threat.  My bill requires DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis to develop and disseminate a threat assessment of the use of virtual currencies to support terrorist activities. Further, to ensure that this information is shared throughout the law enforcement community, my bill requires the assessment to be shared with State, local, and Tribal law enforcement, including those offices that operate within State, local, and regional fusion centers.  Enacting this bill will give counterterrorism and law enforcement officials at all levels the information they need to evolve ahead of this threat and help keep Americans safe. I urge my House colleagues to support my bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

752,topic-id,201,"Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding.  Madam Chair, this is an ideologically driven solution in search of a problem. The U.oil and gas system represents only 3\1/2\ percent of overall domestic greenhouse gas emissions. You ask yourself: If that is the case, if over 96 percent of the problem is elsewhere, why wouldn't we focus on that? It is ideological, that is why.  The temperature impact of this emissions reduction is miniscule, at a mere .0047 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, and, of course, that is a model and that is predicted. No one really knows for sure. But we can know this for sure: it is miniscule.  EPA's own research shows that combined oil and gas methane emissions have fallen 19 percent since 1990. During the same period, natural gas production has risen 52 percent and oil production has increased 28 percent.  The cost of this unnecessary regulation will be $530 million per year by 2025, again, to get .0047 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. 322,000 Pennsylvanians' jobs are supported by the oil and gas industry, and we can't afford it.[[Page H7204]]  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Mullin amendment.

873,topic-id,1769,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the following exchange of letters:         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on            Intelligence,                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.     Michael McCaul,     Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Washington,                Dear Chairman McCaul: I understand H.2453, 2468, and      2470 are slated for consideration on the suspension calendar      next week. All three bills amend the Homeland Security Act of      2002 to make certain improvements in the laws administered by      the Secretary of Homeland Security by requiring the      Secretary, acting through the Chief Intelligence Officer of      the Department, to perform specific intelligence-related      functions. All three[[Page H7235]]     bills are virtually identical to specific provisions      contained in H.2825, the House-passed ``Department of      Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017'' for which I      wrote to you about on June 27, 2017. Accordingly, since H.     2453, 2468, and 2470 implicate National Intelligence Program      (NIP)-funded activities, I expect that they would be      sequentially referred to the Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence (the Committee).       As discussed in previous correspondence regarding H.     2825, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the      Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters on      January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to      clarify the Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over NIP-     funded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).      The January 2017 Exchange of Letters affirmed that,      consistent with the Rules of the House of Representatives,      the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is the vehicle that      through which Congress authorizes annual appropriations for      the NIP, including NIP-funded elements of the Department of      Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those letters made      explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security would not      report to the House any bill that authorizes any elements of      DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such bill is      reported by the Committee on Homeland Security, this      Committee will request a sequential referral of the bill.       In order to expedite the House's consideration of H.     2453, 2468, and 2470, the Committee will forego consideration      of all three measures. This courtesy, is however, conditioned      on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no      way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with      respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matter contained in these bills or any similar measure. It is      also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security's      adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017      Exchange of       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding and would request that you include in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration of all three      bills, a copy of this letter, your response, and the January      2017 Exchange of Letters, including the Thank you      for your cooperation in this matter.

144,topic-id,263,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment. I strongly support additional funding for the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute on I have spent my time in Congress fighting for those agencies.  In fact, over the past 2 years, Democrats on the Labor-HHS Subcommittee have worked closely with Chairman Tom Cole to increase the NIH budgets by $2 billion annually, and I hope we are able to do it again this year.  But this amendment is fundamentally flawed because it slashes $120 million from the CMS Program Keep in mind that the CMS Program Management account is already cut by a $524 million in the underlying bill. That is a 13 percent cut. This amendment would increase that cut to more than 16 percent.  According to HHS, over 143 million Americans will rely on programs administered by CMS, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and the Federal health insurance exchanges.  Why would my colleagues in the majority support more than $600 million in cuts to the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs?  Slashing their administrative budgets by 16 percent is certain to harm services that impact Americans on a daily basis. These cuts will directly harm America's seniors, the blind, low- and middle-income families, children with disabilities, and Americans with chronic conditions like end-stage renal disease, as well as pregnant mothers and newborns.  CMS programs face historic growth in the years to come. A cut of $644 million to its administrative budget would open up the program to mismanagement, fraud, and abuse.

293,topic-id,273,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentlewoman.  This is about giving both sides--the workers seeking to organize and the employer--the opportunity to make their case to workers fairly and expeditiously.  Prior to this case, in every case, employers would have access with ways to pester and bug employees at home, through their personal email, through their phone numbers. There was simply no way that there was any equality given to the case for union organizers to make. In fact, union organizers often had to try to find ways that they could reach to simply make the case to workers so that they can make a fair choice.  In addition, I find it ridiculous that this is called, by those on the other side, an ambush when, in fact, the only ambush is when they ambush the right of workers to organize by drawing out the election process to months and years, often beyond when many of the employees involved are even at the same employer because of the adverse working conditions that could have led them to organize in the first place.  This rule was done through a multistakeholder process. There was a lot input from all sides, and it was a very thoughtful rule that gave a level playing field to ensure that workers, should they desire to organize, had a reasonable calendar for doing so and a reasonable way of reaching other workers to tell them the benefits of organizing, just as the company was telling them the downside.  Mr.Chair, I encourage my colleagues to reject this amendment which throws out a very thoughtful rule that levels the playing field in labor relations.

Pound for pound, methane pollution from oil and gas wells is 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is responsible for a quarter of human-made climate change.  This EPA rule, frankly, is just a starting point. It is a long overdue standard for the oil and gas industry to reduce methane pollution. Frankly, I wish these rules went further, but these stricter standards are a good start; they are necessary. Scientists have published data that shows that methane released during extraction is an incredibly large contributor to the climate threat.  I think it is really critical not to prevent the EPA from moving forward and fulfilling the mission that Congress gave them to protect our air, water, and planet, and that is what this amendment would do, which is why I oppose it.

764,topic-id,426,"Madam Chair, before I begin my comments on this amendment, I want to thank the chairman for including my other amendment regarding volunteer and State wildfire assistance en bloc earlier today.  While a great deal of attention is being paid to Hurricane Harvey and Irma, the West is also being ravaged by wildfires, costing hundreds of millions of dollars and lives.  My amendment with Representatives Renacci and King that passed makes sure that States and local governments will have a little bit more resources with their volunteer fire departments to fight those fires, and I appreciate that.  Madam Chair, this amendment that is at the desk would address the really unsound plan by the EPA to close down their regional field offices. My amendment would prevent this plan from occurring by preventing funds from going to the closure of regional Environmental Protection Agency offices.  We already know that the new EPA leadership has its priorities backwards, focused on how they can help fossil fuels and coal and oil rather than the congressionally mandated responsibility of keeping our air and water clean and helping to keep people healthy.  So earlier this year, when the President's budget included closing ten regional Environmental Protection Agency offices and reports began to surface in April that Secretary Pruitt was looking to close the Region 5 office, which covers the upper Midwest, I was disappointed, hence, this action that I am taking here today with this amendment.  The reports we have heard are surrounding Region 5, but we have no idea which regions they are targeting. In my home State of Colorado, the Region 8 headquarters serves six States and 27 sovereign Tribal nations. Our headquarters in Denver are essential to protecting health and safeguarding the national environment in the American  It is very important to fight against this reckless EPA plan to close down regional offices that keep our air clean. And now more than ever, with tropical storms and flooded chemical plants and oil spills around Houston, we all know how essential EPA presence in the field is. The EPA field offices are often the first responders at the scenes of environmental disasters. Regional field offices are uniquely well versed in particular characteristics in our very diverse geographic  It is very important for Congress to send an unambiguous message that we want to safeguard the lives and welfare of our American citizens, acknowledge and address the very real threat of climate change.

It offers Members of this body a very clear choice about whether or not we want to keep our public lands in the hands of those who rightfully own them, the American public; or if we want to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder.  This amendment would prohibit the Federal use of funds to pursue any additional extralegal ways to turn our Federal lands over to private owners. For example, it would prohibit commissions. It would prohibit groups that would find backdoor ways to do that, or any other means.  My amendment simply ensures that none of the funds through this bill can be used in violation of the law that already exists.

They are a critical part of our American heritage; our Western heritage; in my State, our Colorado heritage; and they serve so many incredible purposes.  First of all, public lands are good for our mind and soul. A U.Army Iraq war veteran who lives in Colorado recently said: ``I fought to protect all that makes our Nation great, and that includes the public lands that belong to every American.''  Second, these lands are good for our bodies by protecting water quality and public health. People hike and fish and enjoy outdoor recreation time. The public lands are the ecosystems that house headwaters of our river systems that we rely on for our drinking water and that help keep our air clean through the plants that they water.  Not only are our lands good for the soul and health, they are also the key economic driver in my district and my Across the country, over $600 billion is generated through outdoor recreation on our public lands, and visiting public lands support over 6 million jobs.  I represent Rocky Mountain National Park, which has over 3 million visitors a year. The entire economy of towns, like Estes Park, rely on our public lands. From small businesses to ski resorts, from gas stations to diners, our economy thrives in districts like mine because of our public lands.

There are Members of this body and there are members of the President's administration that are seeking to sell off our public lands, which would devastate our local economy, undermine wildlife and the ecosystems that we support, and remove a critical iconic part of our Western heritage.  Selling these public lands to private owners would lead to a loss of access to our most majestic, treasured spaces, a critical part of our quality of life not just for Coloradans, but for the millions of people from across the country that visit our wild areas.  Time after time we see real attempts that are made here to transfer our most precious public lands to private ownership or sell them at wholesale.  With this amendment, we offer a clear choice.

646,topic-id,890,"Mr.Chairman, I also want to thank my colleagues, Mr.Sensenbrenner, Mr.Conyers, and Mr.Mooney, for cosponsoring and supporting this amendment.  It is a bipartisan amendment and, I think, a natural complement to the excellent amendments just added from Mr.Walberg and also from Mr.It would prohibit funding made available by this act from being used to implement the recent DOJ policy change, which dramatically expands the Federal Government's civil Asset Forfeiture  The new policy revives a controversial and, I think, unconstitutional practice that has been decried by Americans and Members of Congress across the political spectrum who hold dear the idea of due process and the presumption of innocence as it applies not just to us as people but also to our private property as well.  The new policy allows State and local law enforcement to circumvent State laws limiting civil asset forfeiture by having Federal agencies adopt State and local cases. Under this dubious practice, law enforcement may seize a citizen's cash and property simply because someone suspects it of being connected to criminal activity without convicting, indicting, arresting, or even charging the property owner with having committed a crime and without proving or even alleging in court that the property is somehow connected to criminal activity.  Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property have been seized in this way by law enforcement on an officer's mere suspicion. In order to get your property back, you have to go out and hire a lawyer, you have to go to court, and you have to prove that your property was obtained through innocent means, completely reversing the constitutional presumption of innocence that is at the heart of due process.  This practice is an outrageous violation of property rights, of civil liberties, and of the due process principle that we are all presumed to be innocent as American citizens, and it raises profound questions also under the Takings Clause, which forbids the taking of private property without just compensation by the government.  Although the resurrected policy contains a few new safeguards, they will not remotely prevent abusive seizures or eliminate the profit incentives that encourage rampant civil asset forfeiture. The policy will lead to the same abuses uncovered in 2014.  A Washington Post investigation found that, since 2001, State and local law enforcement had made more than 55,000 seizures of cash and property worth nearly $2.5 billion under the civil Asset Forfeiture  One striking case discussed by The New York Times was of Carole Hinders, owner of a restaurant in Arnolds Park, Iowa, who deposited her cash earnings in the bank on a weekly basis, and it was always under $10,000. She was suspected of illegally structuring her deposits, although they were perfectly innocent, and the IRS simply seized $33,000 from her, causing huge problems for her business.  Another case that caught my eye was of a Chinese-American restaurateur who was traveling with a large sum of[[Page H7275]]money because he was about to buy a building for his new restaurant. He had been saving for decades to buy his own restaurant. He was stopped by the police and became understandably very anxious during the encounter. The police said that they found the large sum of cash money he had with him suspicious, and his nervous demeanor also telling, and they simply seized his money. They detained him for 2 hours. They let him go. They didn't charge him with anything, but they seized his money, his life savings that he had planned to use to purchase the building for his restaurant. He was a lucky one in that he was able, eventually years later, to get his money back, but he lost the business deal and his deposit in the process.  In 2014, the value of money and property seized under civil asset forfeitures by Federal law enforcement exceeded the total of losses in money and property from burglaries in our country. That means our people lost more money at the hands of the government through civil asset forfeiture than from being burglarized.  Because of the abuses revealed in 2015, the DOJ imposed restrictions to limit when the Federal Government could adopt forfeiture cases, and banned State and local police from using Federal law to seize cash and property without criminal charges or warrants, but the new policy lifts these restrictions and places the Federal Government back on the side of the trampling of people's constitutional rights.  With civil asset forfeiture, people cannot only lose their property without being charged with a crime, they can also lose their property when someone else allegedly uses their property in commission of a crime.  A Michigan woman lost a car she co-owned with her husband because he was caught soliciting prostitution while driving her car.  This policy runs roughshod over the property rights of the innocent and burdens our citizens with onerous costs to get their property back that they never should have lost in the first place.  Mr.Chair, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all agree that civil asset forfeiture is a serious threat to constitutional values.  Mr.Chair, I urge all of us to vote for this important amendment.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

864,topic-id,1493,"Mr.President, I have listened intently to the discussions this afternoon with respect to the AUMF of 2001 and the AUMF of 2002, and all of the speakers have made a point that I think is obvious: We have to update our authorizations to account for the past 16 years, to account for the transformation of the threats in those 16 years and many other factors.  The Paul amendment does not give us that transformative language so that we can make a reasoned judgment. It simply gives us a 6-month period of time to work our way through all of the nuances, which are very complicated and difficult. I think it would unwittingly and unintentionally cause more difficulties than be an effective way to urge action and to seek complete action in this Senate and the House and a signature by the  Again, I do understand the concerns of all. I supported the 2001 authorization for the use of military force after the incredible and shattering attacks on New York City, Washington, and the crash of an aircraft in Shanksville, PA, and we responded.  Like so many of my colleagues who were here at the time, I did not expect that 16 years later we would still be engaged in the evolution of that fight that began on 9/11, but we cannot simply stop and threaten to pull back our legal framework with the expectation that in 6 months we will produce a new and more appropriate authorization for the use of military force.  I think we should be on the floor debating such an I think it should have been debated seriously and thoroughly in the Foreign Relations committee, subject to amendment, and brought forward to this Senate so that we could debate it. Then we could present it to our colleagues in the House and ultimately to the President and also do so in the full view of the American public.  What we are simply doing, if the Paul amendment is adopted, is saying: If we can't get our job done in 6 months, then we have no legal authority or questionable legal authority to continue operations across the globe. It would be an arbitrary 6-month period. I think it would, unfortunately, send a very inappropriate signal to our troops and to our allies in the fight across the globe. Also, it would send an unfortunate signal to our adversaries because it would raise, quite literally, the possibility, since we have supported the option, of abandoning our legal basis for conducting many of these operations in 6 months. I think it would be read many places as a signal that the Senate has essentially declared that in 6 months we are going to de-authorize our military efforts. I think that signal would be very disturbing to our troops in the field, to our allies, and it would give a huge propaganda lever to our adversaries.  The 6-month period is not related to our operations on the ground, not related to the planning and the operational procedures that are in place already. It is unrealistic to believe that if we cannot come to some resolution in 6 months, we could suddenly withdraw our forces or find some other reason to prosecute these wars and these efforts.  Again, we have to think seriously about what the message would be if we adopted this resolution. I think the headline might say ``Senate moves to end involvement.'' I am more certain, after multiple trips to Iraq and Afghanistan and recently to Syria, that the headline in Baghdad and Kabul and Damascus would be ``U.moves to end engagement.'' That would cause great concern among our allies. It would cause great concern among our troops.  Operationally, our planning and staging is not something that is done in 6-month periods. It takes months and months for military forces to prepare to go in. Unless we could do something literally next week, we would be running into the reality of American military commanders wondering whether they should begin to plan for the extraction of our forces and the closing of our facilities on these bases. I don't think anyone here believes, with the workload we have, that we could tackle this issue in the next week or two.  As the days go by, that contingency becomes more pressing on our military forces. Those commanders would have to start making serious plans. Those serious plans would be easily communicated to our allies, to our adversaries, and to our troops on the ground. As a result, I think, again, this is not the responsible way to pursue what we all want, which is a more realistic AUMF, one more resonant in terms of being consistent with the reality today.  Some people have argued--in fact, this seems to be the most compelling argument--that this will force Congress to act. Well, I do think we have to act, but I think what the proponents are missing is that our action will not be immediate. As we look ahead, we have recesses that we will observe; we will have other requirements; we have to get appropriations done. We have a host of legislative items. If this effort takes a backseat and we approach the 6 months again, the difficulty of conducting military operations will be significantly complicated. What is intended to be a forward effort in Afghanistan will gradually begin planning for withdrawal, even if at the last moment we come forward with a new authorization.  We have to think about those things because it does affect the troops who are defending us today, it does affect how much our allies will be supportive of our efforts, and it will also, as I indicated, give our adversaries the argument that they have used repeatedly--that the United States is going. It was pointed out years ago on one of my first trips to Afghanistan--a saying has become commonplace where the Taliban would say: ``You all have the watches, we have the time.'' And what we are doing with this measure is once again giving them the time so they can predict or proselytize with more power that our presence will be diminished.  Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson have written to the Senate leadership expressing their concerns with this approach, and I immensely respect both gentlemen. I particularly respect Secretary Mattis for his service. He has been on the ground. He knows what it takes to lead marines, soldiers, airmen, and sailors in action. They are quite concerned. They are concerned about issues, too, to which we have not devoted full attention.  As Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson indicate, there is a strong argument that the legal basis for continuing to hold captured combatants at Guantanamo Bay would be taken away and that these individuals could, through our courts, apply for habeas corpus and could likely be released--[[Page S5210]]something that I don't think anyone would want to see. The presence of an AUMF provides a legal basis for holding these very dangerous combatants at Guantanamo  I think it could also affect our ongoing operations against terrorists throughout the globe, particularly our military operations, our special forces operations that are focused on terrorists connected to Al-Qaida, connected to ISIS, connected to those groups who have, over several administrations, been included within the scope of the  To a point my colleagues have made, administrations going back to President George Bush, the Obama administration, and now the Trump administration--particularly in the case of the Obama and Bush administrations--have adjusted the AUMF to confront new circumstances, such as the rise of ISIS, et cetera. They have done so, though, in the context of a congressional statute, not because of the expansive power, under article II of the Constitution, of the President to defend the United One issue here is, again, do we want to put ourselves in the position where there is no governing law; rather it is simply that article II of the Constitution that provides the legal basis?  For many reasons, I hope we will think carefully about our role with respect to Senator Paul's amendment. He has been tireless in his advocacy--``relentless,'' I think, is probably a better word. He is doing so with the utmost integrity and the utmost commitment to doing what he thinks is in the best interest of the United  I come here today to point out what I think our consequences would be, which would be very serious and very detrimental to ourselves, particularly our troops. I ask all of my colleagues to think clearly about what we are doing. We should and we must replace the AUMFs--both of them; however, until we have a replacement, we shouldn't create a 6-month period of uncertainty, doubt, and confusion. That is what it will be because it will affect our soldiers, our allies, and in some respects, give more leverage to our adversaries.  With that, I yield the floor.

Staffing challenges not only jeopardize the safety of our men and women in uniform, but also directly lead to the breakdown and trust between law enforcement and our communities.  From my over 33 years of experience in law enforcement, I know that police departments and sheriffs' offices must have the staff necessary to engage with their communities and proactively respond to their needs, instead of running from one call to the next.  COPS Hiring is a proven program that studies have shown reduces crime without a corresponding increase in arrests. Effective policing lowers crime rates and builds strong community relationships. Throughout my time in Congress, I have been fighting to keep this program funded. It is the same this year.  While I appreciate that the bill before us includes a $100 million increase for Byrne-JAG law enforcement grant program, and I thank the chairman for his efforts, I am disappointed that it doesn't provide funding for the COPS Hiring  As this process moves forward, I urge the chairman to include funding for the COPS Hiring We must continue this program that has been so important to State and local law enforcement. This program is not just good for those who put their lives on the line every day, but it benefits all citizens as our country works to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

630,topic-id,375,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.  Asset forfeiture is a crime against the American people, committed by their own government. This is absolutely opposite of what our people who wrote the Constitution of the United States had in mind.  For the government to take away someone's property and then say, ``You have to prove you are innocent to get it back,'' that is totally in contrast to the limited government, individual responsibility, individual freedom, and property rights concepts that our Founding Fathers had in mind.  If we believe in freedom and if we believe in liberty, let's not open up the government to be able to steal our property and then we have to go to court. We have lost all of our due process. It is now our obligation to prove that we are innocent until proven guilty. That is ridiculous. Vote for this amendment and protect the freedom of our people.  Mr.Chair, I rise as a proud co-sponsor in strong support of the Amash-Sanford-Labrador-Rohrabacher  Civil asset forfeiture is a widely abused law enforcement tactic in which federal, state and local law enforcement agencies seize property, often with little or no evidence that a crime has been committed. The person whose property has been seized then has to hire an attorney and prove their innocence in order to try to get their property back.  Police departments have a strong incentive to abuse civil asset forfeiture because they get to keep these ill-gotten gains for their own use. Even when state legislatures have enacted important safeguards against abuse, the Justice Department has helped local police departments to circumvent such restrictions by ``adopting'' seizures that would be illegal under state law, and then sharing the proceeds with local law enforcement.  In January 2015, under the Obama Administration, the Justice Department issued two crucial orders to stop this circumvention of state, raw. Unfortunately, the current Justice Department has reversed those orders, and Congress must now take action.  This amendment will prohibit the Justice Department from using any money in this bill to engage in activities not allowed by the 2015 orders. I ask my colleagues to stop the assaults against law-abiding citizens by the people who are supposed to protect them.

516,topic-id,571,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to increase funding to the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering research directorate, commonly known as  CISE supports research in computing, communications, information science, and engineering. Through their NSF-supported work, our Nation's scientists have been able to develop innovative solutions to energy,[[Page H7258]]advanced manufacturing, national security, healthcare, and personal communications.  CISE also provides advanced cyber infrastructure for all areas of science and engineering, and it contributes to the education and training of computer engineers, ensuring our future generations are well equipped with the skills they need in an increasingly competitive global market.  In Nevada and across the country, we are continuing to see a huge demand for workers in the tech industry, including software developers, analysts, engineers, and computer programmers like myself. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the computing industry's rate of job creation in the U.is now three times the national average. In order for our workforce to continue to push the boundaries, we must invest in research and training programs at  CISE is particularly important because it provides funding for cutting-edge computing and information science research, which is critical to innovation in nearly all lines of work from business to government.  Simply put, the 21st century runs on computers and constantly evolving technologies. As one of the few women in Congress to build her career in STEM, I know all too well the demand for talent in STEM is real, and we must make smart investments now.  Current CISE projects across the country include developing unmanned aerial systems technology to help reduce wildfires, creating new clinical modeling techniques to use electronic health records for personalized patient care, and strengthening our cyber infrastructure.  In my district, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas is using CISE funding for several groundbreaking initiatives. One of their projects focuses on increasing the participation of students with disabilities in computer science courses by creating accessible tools and curricula, preparing professors for diverse students.  UNLV is also partnering with the local Clark County School District to mentor high school teachers on computer science, cybersecurity, and big data.  Mr.Chairman, this current bill maintains fiscal year 2017 level funding for NSF research and related activities, which CISE is funded through. That is admirable, given the fact that President Trump's proposed budget slashed NSF research. Maintaining level funding shows shared, bipartisan support for scientific research right here in  I thank the majority and the subcommittee chairman for recognizing the importance of supporting computer and information science. However, even with this funding level, according to agency leadership, the NSF has had to deny over $2 billion worth of excellent proposals every year, indicating the fact that it is underfunded.  If we are going to be serious about competing in the economy of tomorrow and the economy of today, then we must continue funding programs that help our country to remain the global leader in innovation, productivity, economic growth, and provide good-paying jobs for the future.  My amendment would increase funding to CISE by 2 percent, allowing it to keep up with year-over-year inflation and fund the same number of grants as previous years.

636,topic-id,707,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, let me tell you a quick story. Andrew Clyde served three combat tours in Iraq, after which he returned home and opened a store in Mr.Clyde had an insurance policy that only covered up to $10,000 in off-premised losses. So like any reasonable person, he never brought more than $10,000 in cash with him when he was making his nightly deposits.  Do you know what happened next?  The Internal Revenue Service noticed that he was depositing just under $10,000 in cash regularly, so they took all of his cash. That is $950,000.  If you are like most people, you are confused when you first hear about this. As it turns out, Mr.Clyde was in violation of a Federal law known as structuring, which is the intentional avoidance of Federal reporting requirements by staying below $10,000 in cash deposits. This law was intended to catch large-scale criminal enterprises, mobsters, terrorists, and human traffickers, not veterans like Mr. When structuring is believed to have occurred, the IRS can use its civil asset forfeiture authority to seize funds in question and force the owner to prove that the money was earned legally.  Well, in this instance, Andrew Clyde earned the money legally and had a legitimate reason for depositing less than $10,000. So you would assume that Mr.Clyde would have ended this with the IRS talking to him and then saying: Oh, we made a mistake. Clearly you are not a mobster or a terrorist. Thank you for your service. Here is your life savings back.  But, no, that is not what happened, Mr.That is not how the story ended.  Instead, the IRS threatened him with criminal structuring charges until he agreed to settle with the agency and give them $50,000, after he had already spent $100,000 in legal fees. He lost $150,000 simply because he wanted to make sure that his cash deposits were low enough to be insured. If that sounds messed up to you, Mr.Chairman, that is because it is.  Now, here is the good news. The House recently passed, unanimously, H.1843, the RESPECT This bill prohibits the IRS from seizing funds from individuals, unless there is a probable cause that the money was earned illegally or connected to an illegal activity. But there is still the problem of those people who are already victims of this abuse by our government in civil asset forfeiture.  Now, since we began our bipartisan investigation of the IRS's civil asset forfeiture practices a couple of years ago, the IRS has apologized for past behavior, which is good; they worked quickly to reach out to possible victims, which is good; and they subsequently responded to the 454 petitions that they received. As of March 1, the IRS returned over $6 million in seized funds. Good news. So far so good.  But the plot continues, and here is where we are right now. It turns out that a majority of the petitions were actually referred to the Department of The IRS referred the DOJ 255 cases, and has recommended that the DOJ return $16 million to taxpayers whom they do not suspect of being conducted in any way to illegal activity. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has not been nearly as interested in correcting these past wrongdoings.  As of July, the Department of Justice responded only to 73 of the outstanding 255 cases. This is completely unacceptable. The Federal Government took legally earned money from taxpayers, and the Department of Justice hasn't given the majority of these people a response, including Andrew  The Roskam-Neal amendment, offered by myself and Mr.Neal, the ranking member from Massachusetts on the Ways and Means Committee, is very simple.

We will be offering two amendments as part of our Better Deal agenda, including a ``Buy American'' provision and an amendment that would drastically cut down on outsourcing.  For too long, loopholes in our ``Buy American'' rules have allowed Federal agencies to waive ``Buy American'' requirements and skirt the spirit of the law. A single loophole--the overseas exemption, which allows a Federal agency to waive ``Buy American'' rules if the product is intended for use overseas--accounts for 65 percent of the exemptions that the Department of Defense issues in a given year.  Senator Baldwin has an amendment that would eliminate these loopholes and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent by Federal agencies to purchase products that are made here in the United  My friend Senator Stabenow has been a leading voice on this issue as well. She has an amendment that would also roll back the overseas exemption by requiring the DOD to identify and give consideration to domestically sourced items before soliciting any offers for anything that is not ``Buy American'' compliant.  Right now, there are also several American companies with records of outsourcing American jobs that are receiving defense contracts, and companies receive a tax credit for outsourcing expenses rather than incentives to[[Page S5195]]bring jobs back to the United We should put a stop to both, and Senator Donnelly's amendment will do that. His amendment will give a tax credit of up to 20 percent for expenses that companies incur to bring jobs back to our shores.  Another critical amendment is a bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Graham and Klobuchar on the issue of election security. The consensus of 17 U.intelligence agencies was that Russia, a foreign adversary, interfered in our elections. Make no mistake--their success in 2016 will encourage them to try again. We have State elections in a couple of months, and the 2018 election is a little more than a year away. We must improve our defenses now to ensure that we are prepared. The Graham-Klobuchar amendment would greatly strengthen our defenses, helping to prepare States for the inevitable cyber attacks that threaten the integrity of our elections. We should pass it as part of the  As Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed continue discussions on this bill--and I know their relationship is a good and strong one--I hope they strongly consider the inclusion of these three critical amendments.                     Election Integrity Commission  Mr.President, speaking of elections, a word on President Trump's Election Integrity Commission, which is meeting with the public for the first time today in New I have three points.  First, I would like to dispel the idea that this Commission has anything to do with election integrity. It was borne out of the President's baseless claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 elections. That is just not true. The Commission will never find evidence to support that claim.  Second, the public officials on this Commission must stop making similarly outrageous claims about voter fraud in elections. Recently, the Commission's Vice Chair, Kris Kobach, claimed that the New Hampshire Senate election could have been swung by illegal votes because they found a number of voters who had out-of-State licenses. Of course, there are several reasonable, legal, legitimate reasons as to why someone would vote in a State while having a license from a different Most likely, if you live at a college in New Hampshire but come from out of State, your car has an out-of-State license plate. By State law, if you are registered at a New Hampshire college, it is perfectly legal to vote there.  We all know that the States set these laws. In fact, when the Washington Post tried to identify some of these voters, the first four they randomly called were all college students who lived in New Hampshire but who went to school elsewhere.  Yet this Commission and, I would say, particularly its Vice Chair, Mr.Kobach, are so eager to prove their point--which is virtually unprovable--that there is a huge amount of voter fraud that they come up with these baseless claims and then have to back off. Throwing these kinds of deeply misleading, bogus claims around about stolen elections and massive voter fraud without there being any actual evidence is extremely irresponsible and damaging to our democracy. They are so eager to prove their point about voter fraud, which is demonstrably false, that they are resorting to these crazy claims, discrediting their Commission and discrediting themselves.  Lastly, a broader point. The Election Integrity Commission is a punishment in search of a transgression that never happened, which shows that it likely has an ulterior motive.  Voter fraud is extremely rare. A comprehensive study by the Washington Post in 2014 concluded that out of over 1 billion ballots cast between 2000 and 2014, there were only 31 credible instances of voter fraud, and even some of those were debatable, according to the study. The Brennan Center for Justice concluded that an American has a better chance of being struck by lightening than impersonating another voter at the polls.  So why the need for a Presidential advisory commission? Because the real target of the Election Integrity Commission is not voter fraud but voter suppression, especially the suppression of African-American voters, poor voters, elderly voters, and Latino voters. Just like the campaigns for outrageous voter ID laws in State after State--many have been thrown out by the courts for being blatantly discriminatory--the Election Integrity Commission seems focused on throwing up barriers to voting through intimidation, misleading claims, and controversial tactics, like the widespread collection of sensitive, personal voter information.  I think what this Commission is trying to do flies in the face of what the country is all about. We want everyone to vote. We do not want to scare people, intimidate people, or make it harder for people to vote. If there were overwhelming evidence of fraud, obviously we would need to do something, but there is not. As I said, it is a solution--a nasty solution--in search of a problem. The Election Integrity Commission ought to be disbanded, and we will be looking for ways to do that legislatively.  The real threat to election integrity comes not from voter fraud but from foreign meddling and cyber attacks. We should pass the Graham-Klobuchar amendment rather than continue with the nonsense of this  Moreover, with voter participation rates being so low, we should be spending our time and energy encouraging more Americans to exercise their fundamental right to vote rather than wasting taxpayer dollars for a commission to solve a problem that does not exist.          50th Anniversary of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation  Mr.President, before I yield the floor, today is the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, which does great work in my State in combating a very debilitating type of disease. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the accomplishments of the foundation and encouraging more research, better access to care, and improved treatments for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  The New York-based Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, along with its partnering chapters across the country, is the largest national voluntary health group seeking the cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It also works to improve the quality of life of children and adults affected by these diseases.  One in every 200 Americans struggles with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, collectively known as inflammatory bowel diseases, Although no cause has been identified for Crohn's disease, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, and/or environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Further complicating matters, ulcerative colitis is the result of an abnormal response by the body's immune system.  The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation sponsors basic and clinical research of the highest quality and offers a wide range of educational programs and supportive services for patients and healthcare professionals. In 2015, IBD Plexus was launched. IBD Plexus is a groundbreaking initiative that provides the infrastructure and capacities to facilitate and accelerate research into the causes and treatments of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control and Prevention, and the Department of Defense each support meaningful research and public health activities on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services both play a significant role in approving new treatments and facilitating health care financing policies that impact patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  I deeply appreciate the work of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation and its longstanding dedication to the patients it represents.

793,topic-id,630,"Mr.President, 16 years ago today, my city, our country, changed forever. On September 11, 2001, our country was attacked; the World Trade Center towers fell; the Pentagon was in flames; and the smoke rising from an empty field in Pennsylvania reminded us that as cataclysmic as the attack was, the conspirators had planned even greater destruction.  It was a day of fear and helplessness, of phones ringing endlessly--when they worked--husbands calling wives, wives calling husbands, folks in search of brothers, sisters, neighbors, and colleagues.  I will never forget the next day. President Bush provided a plane so that Senator Clinton and I could fly back to New The smell of death was in the air. Lined up outside before you entered into the grounds where the Twin Towers were, were hundreds of people with little signs with pictures: Have you seen my father Jim? Have you seen my daughter Mary? That will stay with me forever.  More than 3,000 souls were taken from us--a guy I had played basketball with in high school, a businessman who had helped me on my way up, a firefighter with whom I had done blood drives. It was one of the bloodiest days on American soil since the Civil  On September 12, 2001, I called on Americans to wear the flag in a sign of solidarity. Every day since, I have worn this flag in remembrance of those who were lost and those brave souls who died rushing to the towers to find those who still might be alive. God willing, I will wear it every day of my life for the rest of my life.  September 11 was one of those before-and-after moments. Nothing has been the same since. We awakened to a new manner of evil that had previously been beyond our imagination.  But on this day, as we solemnly remember those who were taken from us, let us also remember what that day revealed about us. ``On a normal day, we value heroism because it is uncommon,'' wrote Nancy Gibbs of Time Magazine 3 days after the attack. ``On 11, we valued heroism because it was everywhere.''  Firefighters and police and union workers searched, undaunted, through dust and smoke, through fire and ash, for citizens who might still be alive, trapped in the rubble. Average Americans pulled the wounded to safety. Folks from coast to coast lined up for blood drives and pooled their money for donations.  I will never forget the picture of a man who owned a shoe store two blocks north of the towers and was giving out shoes to everyone because they didn't have theirs on as they rushed to get out of the towers--just a small act of charity and selflessness. It was repeated over and over again because those kinds of acts are deep in the American soul.  This morning I came from the 9/11 Memorial in New York Where once there were mighty towers, now there are two deep scars in the But all around the memorial, New York City is alive and thriving.  In the days after, they wrote it off. They said that no one would live south of Canal or Chamber Street, companies would flee, and New York's greatest days were over. But we New Yorkers are a tough breed. We rebuilt. We came back stronger.  On this day, we should always remember that beside our distinctive spirit of independence, resilience, and uncommon heroism are essential parts of the American character.  I do have to say how proud I am of my city. Downtown is bustling, and 50,000 people live there who didn't live there before. Businesses have relocated. It is a new ``in'' area. Bin laden is gone. The evil men with him are gone. We thrive.

532,topic-id,157,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  This reduction would have a significant impact on public safety. The ATF would be investigating fewer firearm traffickers and violent gangs. They would be unable to respond effectively to theft burglaries from Federal firearms licensees. These cuts would weaken the ATF's ability to do its primary responsibilities: combat violent crime and regulate the firearms and explosive industries.  Not surprisingly, a reduction of this magnitude would result in approximately 400 employees being laid off. According to the ATF, that means they would have to eliminate approximately 200 special agents, 65 industry operations investigators, and 135 professional technical positions. The elimination of these positions at ATF directly degrades the Department's capacity to combat violent firearm crimes and regulate the firearms and explosives industries.  I just think that this is not a proper amendment at this time or, for that matter, at any time, and I join the chairman in agreeing on this.

539,topic-id,483,"Mr.Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this very misguided amendment. This amendment would allow felons and other dangerous individuals to try to regain the ability to own guns by sending an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  I am not sure why the Member would offer an amendment that makes it easier for felons to get guns. Most Americans would be shocked by such a proposal. Each year since 1993, Congress has prohibited ATF from processing applications from felons seeking to have their gun rights restored, and with good reason.  Prior to 1993, there were numerous examples of felons who had their gun rights restored by ATF only to go on to commit further crimes later. For example, in 1977, Michael Paul Dahnert of Wisconsin was convicted of burglary. In 1986, he was granted relief and allowed to, once again, own firearms. Two months later, he was rearrested and charged with first degree sexual assault and four counts of second degree sexual assault, for which he received 5 years in prison.  In 1977, James Morgan was convicted of perjury to a grand jury. In 1988, he was granted relief and allowed to gain and own firearms. He was arrested that same year for first degree wanton endangerment and later sentenced to 6 months confinement and 2 years probation.  These are only a few examples. It is important to point out that the gentleman's amendment makes no distinction as far as the seriousness of the offense for which the individual was initially denied a firearm, and ATF would need to investigate all applications for gun rights restoration. Furthermore, simply processing these applications would require significant ATF agent resources and would divert ATF away from its core law enforcement mission of fighting firearm offenses.  Since 1998, when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System was put in use, well over 1 million firearm transfers have been denied after background checks established that the individuals attempting to purchase the firearms were prohibited from processing firearms.  Even if only 20 percent of the denied individuals file an application with ATF to have their gun rights restored, this would require the efforts of hundreds of full-time ATF agents to perform background checks of these individuals. The agents would be diverted[[Page H7261]]from their primary law enforcement investigation.  Even though ATF is legally required to ensure that the applicant ``will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety,'' we know that this process is not perfect, as evidenced by the examples I just gave.  The bottom line is that this amendment would give guns back to felons and, at the same time, sharply reduce ATF's resources for pursuing violent crime investigations. Both of these outcomes would seriously harm public safety, and for these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

566,topic-id,298,"Mr.Chair, if the gentleman had brought some cooked fish, I probably wouldn't read this.  Mr.Chair, this is not an appropriate amendment for inclusion in an annual spending bill. Congress should not be in the business of micromanaging fish conservation in this manner.  The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is an interstate compact that was established in 1942 as a mechanism to allow Atlantic coastal States to join forces in managing their shared fishery resources.  For over 75 years, this Commission has served as a body for the Atlantic coastal States, coordinating the conservation and management of 27 nearshore fish species. Each State is represented on the Commission by three commissioners who participate in deliberations and interstate fisheries management, fisheries science, habitat conservation, and law enforcement.  Through these activities, the States collectively ensure the sound conservation of management of their shared coastal fishery resources. We should allow the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to do its job in managing fish stocks. We must not allow the House to be in the business of second-guessing them and micromanaging fish regulations in particular locations.  There is a process currently in place for addressing these issues at the regional level, and we should allow that process to work. A stock assessment for striped bass is planned for next year. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission can make a determination as to whether it intends to ask the Federal Government to open up the Block Island Transit Zone to striped bass fishing.  Currently, the consensus position of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is that the fishing restrictions should remain in place.

593,topic-id,592,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It would prohibit funds allocated in the bill from being used on the construction and operation of private, for-profit prisons.[[Page H7269]]  The use of private prisons in our country is a crisis. More and more Americans are being locked up in facilities that don't respect basic human rights. One in four people behind bars worldwide is in a United States jail. That is right. A country with less than 5 percent of the world's population accounts for a quarter of all the world's prisoners. In fact, our prison population has continued to increase over the past few decades, even as statistics have shown a decrease in crime.  According to the FBI, violent and major property crimes are at historic lows. Nevertheless, more and more Americans are getting locked up. There are several reasons for this: from overly punitive mandatory minimum sentences to the cycle of poverty in the school-to-prison pipeline.  But one thing is for sure: so long as there is an incentive to build prison cells for profit, there will be more Americans unnecessarily behind bars. So long as we perpetuate the prison industrial complex, we will find it harder and harder to reduce our bloated prison population and make meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system.  Last year, an investigative reporter for The Nation uncovered horrible conditions at private correction facilities. Inmates were not receiving basic medical care, even items required by the Bureau of In one case, they were kept in rows of bunk beds in un-air-conditioned domes, baking in the heat and the sun. In another case, the poor conditions sparked riots by the inmates.  Now, don't get me wrong. I feel no sympathy for violent criminals who have no remorse for what they did and deserve to be locked away for their crimes. But our Founders knew that we have an obligation to maintain respect for human life, and they enshrined it in our Constitution by protecting against cruel and unusual punishment.  When this report came to light, President Obama's Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, chose to act. The President issued a memorandum saying that we would phase out the use of private prisons, partially by seeking to reduce our prison population.  But in February, in keeping with this administration's policy of simply reversing everything President Obama did, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the order. He has since indicated that we won't continue to use private prisons.  We will use more of them, and we will lock up more people to fill them. What a disgrace. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars and a waste of countless American lives that could be turned around and made into successful citizens.  I am proud that in my home city of New York we have decided to divest our pension system from the for-profit prison industry. But now it is time for the Federal Government to divest itself as well.  We must continue to work on comprehensive criminal justice reform that seeks to reform mandatory minimum sentences and curb the failed war on drugs and focus on reentry and reintegration so that those who serve time can become productive members of society, rather than lifelong inmates.  Tonight, we can start with this amendment and send a message to the Trump administration. Tonight, we can tell him not to reverse the progress made under President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Tonight, we can say that making money off of incarcerating individuals is simply inconsistent with American values.

The National Ocean Policy is designed to improve stewardship of our oceans, coasts, islands, and Great Lakes by directing government agencies with differing mandates to coordinate and work together. The National Ocean Policy creates no new authorities.  The result of increased coordination is better stewardship of our national heritage through improved government efficiency, better development and use of data and information, and a process of open and transparent stakeholder engagement that informs decisionmaking. This increased coordination between agencies needs to take place on a Federal level to reduce inefficiency, waste, and redundancy between agencies.  The National Ocean Council brings together State, local, and Tribal governments and all of the oceans uses, including recreational and commercial fishermen, boaters, industries, scientists, and the public, to better plan for, manage, harmonize, and sustain uses of ocean and coastal resources.  The bottom line is that the National Ocean Policy offers an avenue for thoughtful planning around issues affecting ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes areas.

As we all know, Federal grant recipients of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP, are not using Federal funds in contravention of Federal law.  The amendment is really about so-called sanctuary cities.

808,topic-id,741,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule, and I believe the entire country understands why we have the underlying legislation that we have before us today.  The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.601, the Hurricane Supplemental, Debt Limit, Continuing Appropriations, and Flood Insurance  Mr.Speaker, what this means is that the United States Congress, the House of Representatives, first acted in response to the hurricane that hit Texas and Louisiana and caused flooding across the United We then passed that directly to the United States Senate, in working with the President of the United States and the administration, and the Senate has provided back the necessary agreement that they passed. That is why we are here today.  We are here today because this great Nation is finding itself in a desperate plight of fighting with, for, and against Mother Nature, in an effort to provide the citizens of the United States of America with the assurances that, at a time when FEMA is engaged in over 30 different efforts across the country, the United States Congress is nimble enough and able enough to see the need of the people of the United States and to respond appropriately.  It is a private-public partnership that takes place not just with the Federal Government, but it is a government-to-government relationship that takes place also with the United States FEMA organization representing the administration and the American people of the States in which those people reside.  I must tell you that I have been impressed with not only the actions that the Federal Government has taken, but I am proud each morning that I stand up and see FEMA and its representatives discussing, preparing, and providing the American people with the necessary information, the cause and the backup to be prepared for what lies ahead.  This legislation directly addresses the critical responses that are needed by this Nation and meets the funding obligations of the My fellow Texans, several of whom will be speaking this morning on the rule, are men[[Page H7188]]who were directly in the face of the storm; and the people whom they represent and the people who have confidence in them are asking them for the necessary proper help that the United States Government would wish to give. These men and women of the Texas delegation have seen this problem together, and they are addressing it as a team.  We come together not just as Republican and Democrat, men and women, but we come together as a nation. And quite honestly, Mr.Speaker, Texans are overwhelmed with the response that we have seen not just from our colleagues, but the wishes, hopes, and prayers of this Nation, those who have come to Texas and are helping us out.  We now turn our thoughts and ideas and prayers to others who are in harm's way. We are well aware that it has come across our territories, it is entering the United States soon, perhaps as early as this morning, and we have done our work here today and will get that work done as we finalize the vote.  We appreciate and respect and thank the Nation for its support.  Please know that this legislation provides us, today, essential emergency disaster relief for those areas devastated by storms. A $15.25 billion emergency supplemental package is contained within this legislation. What we intend to do is to provide this and make it available to the States, where our elected officials will be administering the things that will make them available, along with FEMA, to the American people and to the people who were affected.  Mr.Speaker, yesterday I received a call from a gentleman, George Bush, who is our land commissioner in Commissioner Bush asked me to not only thank the United States Congress, but also the American people. He asked me, along with Governor Greg Abbott from the State of Texas, to thank the American people for standing with us.  We may have been in harm's way, we may have seen over 50 inches of rain, we may have tens of thousands of people who are still in harm's way, but we are not too proud to say thank you, thank you to this great Nation for hearing our call, seeing our need, and, today, providing the necessary resources to help us rebuild our lives.

Our rising waters and warming seas are contributing to the historic storms we are seeing now.

Scientists estimate this could drive up the Earth's temperature by as much as 1.7 degrees If this isn't enough to make clear the perils of climate change, I don't know what it will take.  Mr.Speaker, I am relieved that a bipartisan compromise has been reached on some of the most important and urgent matters that we face. The bill includes a short-term extension of the debt ceiling, a continuing resolution to fund the government, and provides the first installment of aid to those communities impacted by Hurricane  I was glad to see this deal pass the Senate overwhelmingly on Thursday by a vote of 80-17. It is a testament to what we can do when we work together even during these especially partisan times.  The agreement may have been a surprise, but it was a welcome one. We can now step back from the cliff, get to work on the many other priorities we face this month, including passing the Dream Act and reauthorizing the FAA, which is critical; the Children's Health Insurance Program, also critical; and the Perkins Loan program. Many low-income students in college depend on Perkins to get a good education.  So this compromise will get us through to December 8, and that means we will find ourselves back here in the same situation a few months from now. I hope that once again we can put the country before ideology and prevent the self-inflicted wound that would come from playing chicken with our economy.

I am proud to represent the 22nd District of New York, a once thriving hub of innovation and manufacturing. My district has suffered the fate of too many Rust Belt communities.  Against the backdrop of crushing taxes and soaring costs, it is harder than ever for my constituents to find good-paying jobs that match their skills. A tragic result of this lack of opportunity has been increasing poverty, especially among our most vulnerable populations.  In addition to supporting commonsense pro-growth policies in Congress to reduce regulations and encourage innovation, programs like the Community Services Block Grant play a vitally important role in fulfilling the unmet needs of our neighbors.  CSBG funding directly supports programs aimed at reducing poverty and assisting low-income individuals, the homeless, and the elderly. It allows States and community action agencies in each of our districts the flexibility to improve living conditions, increase self-sufficiency, and foster strong family support systems.  In my district, the Mohawk Valley Community Action Agency in Utica has received more than $640,000 from the CSBG program, which they have used to support Head Start programming that promotes early childhood development, and the Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps seniors meet ever-rising energy costs in the very cold  All told, the CSBG program accounts for more than $55 million in financial assistance to New York State funding, which touches the lives of more than 705,000 New This number includes more than 46,000 individuals with disabilities and more than 317,000 children in my district.

208,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, I support providing immediate emergency assistance for those affected by recent natural disasters and was glad to vote for such a bill earlier this week. I believe that raising the debt limit for only three months is a mistake because it does not provide the certainty that financial markets and our economy need.  But most concerning to me, and the reason I am voting against this bill, is that it forces our military to operate under a stopgap continuing resolution--once again.  Continuing resolutions do enormous, lasting damage to the American military. We are witnessing an alarming increase in accidents, growing evidence of a force under stress, and an eroding technological position when compared with our adversaries. Not only does this bill fail to remedy those problems, it makes them worse.  This bill, like other CRs, allows no new starts--the Pentagon must spend the same money on the same things as last year. But the world is not standing still. In fact, the threats from North Korea and others grow every day. Yet, this CR prevents us from responding.  The Constitution places on Congress the responsibility to ``raise and support'', ``provide and maintain'' the military forces of the United It is morally wrong for our nation to send brave men and women out on mission--even routine training or operations--without the very best equipment, the very best training, the very best support our country can provide.

290,topic-id,455,"Mr.Chairman, I, too, want to thank Chairman Cole for the good effort on this piece of legislation.  I rise to offer an amendment to H.3354 that would block the NLRB from enforcing the extreme and partisan ambush election rule. Under the ambush election rule, workers are being rushed into union elections before they have the opportunity to consider all the consequences.  According to one report, since the ambush election rule took effect, union elections have been organized 38 percent faster. Before this rule took effect, the union election process typically took 38 days. Now, workers may have as few as 11 days to consider whether joining a union is the best decision for themselves. Eleven days is simply not enough time for workers to make an important decision that impacts their job and their paycheck.  In addition to speeding up the process, the NLRB's rule greatly limits an employer's ability to communicate with its employees through the pre-election hearing process.  To make matters worse, employers have as little as 7 days to find legal counsel and appear before an NLRB election officer--7 days. This is a taxing time constraint, especially on small businesses with limited resources and a lawyer team that is nonexistent.  But workers are the ones who are really hurt the most. As a former union worker myself, I respect the right of workers to join a union, but they deserve a real choice in the matter and the opportunity to hear from both sides of the debate. At the very least, they deserve privacy as they come to their decision, but this rule forces employers to hand over their employees' personal information, including phone numbers, work schedules, home addresses, e-mail addresses, and work locations.  The NLRB should ensure fair and transparent elections. Instead, the board implemented a rule chilling employer free speech and restricting the rights of workers.  By adopting this amendment to block the ambush election rule, we can restore the rights of workers and employers in union elections.  I would note that there is still more to be done beyond blocking funding of this extreme rule. The Workforce Democracy and Fairness Act, which I introduced earlier this year, would amend Federal law to ensure union elections are fair and prevent similar NLRB overreach in the future.  This commonsense bill was approved by the Education and the Workforce Committee, and it is my hope that it will come up for a vote in the House, but today we have an opportunity to take a first step toward putting an end to this radical scheme once and for all.  Mr.Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, as well as the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

292,topic-id,247,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues from the Education and the Workforce We have debated that very clearly. We have discussed the fact that individuals ought to be able to make a decision and have a full understanding of what is available for them.  But when we talk about a streamlining rule, it only works for the union organizer. It doesn't work for the employee, and certainly not for the small-business person who isn't blessed with having a large lawyer team, attorney team, who can go into all of the background information to find out how, indeed, they even represent themselves and communicate with their employees in relationship to a union that is well-versed in what they will do with their challenge in the lawyered-up situation that they have.  It discourages any comprehensive study by the employee--let me state that again--by the employee of what they are looking at with union representation or without.  Seven days for a businessperson to get their act together is not a streamlining that works for them. It works for the union organizer alone, not the employee or the employer.  Mr.Chairman, I continue to state that, if we truly want our employees to make informed decisions with all of the information that can be available to them and the assistance needed so that both sides are served when they look for a final decision, we must do away with this rule.

H.931, the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2017, introduced by my friend and colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Chris Collins from New York, who we will hear from shortly, will create a national registry to collect information to better understand cancer incidence in firefighters.  These heroic first responders experience occupational health risks every day. In my district, it is oftentimes from forest fires, like we are having all summer long. This past weekend I saw firsthand what our firefighters face as they battle a number of fires raging in Oregon, putting themselves in harm's way to save property, infrastructure, lives, watersheds, habitats, and our forests.  I was deeply reminded yesterday morning, as I watched some of the news coverage that took us back 16 years ago to 9/11, and seeing the scenes of the buildings collapsing and burning and the people emerging, individual citizens, first responders, caked in dust and toxins and dealing with smoke, you realize just the peril that our first responders often find themselves in. They rush into buildings to save lives, and we deeply appreciate what they do. That is why this legislation is an important step to help them.  Nationwide, we have this problem with our firefighters. They came to us and said: We need this registry.  Again, going back to the West and what we face, and I saw it when I flew across the country to come here, not only are there fires and smoke throughout Oregon, but also all across the West: Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, hill and valley choked with smoke.  Close to 8 million acres burned in wildfires so far this year; more than half a million in Oregon on both public and mostly private lands. Thousands of residents have had to be evacuated. Firefighters, of course, stayed behind. They do what they do.  Multiple studies have shown a correlation between firefighting and cancer. However, the reasons behind this are not fully understood. We owe it to these first responders to understand the causal link to cancer. Having better data to identify why firefighters are at an increased risk for some cancers will hopefully lead to better protective measures and ultimately reduce some of the hazards that they face when putting their lives on the line.

16,topic-id,986,"Mr.President, on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised working families that he would subject every proposal he saw in the White House to a simple test: ``Does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?'' He claimed he wasn't ``going to let Wall Street get away with murder,'' and he said he was going to ``drain the swamp.''  Such great talk--and then he got to His first order of business was to put together a team of people who had spent decades as executives at big banks and large corporations--people who are determined to tilt the playing field in favor of Wall Street and against working families. You don't need to look very far to see them. His most senior economic advisers--Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, and the senior counselor for economic initiatives, Dina Powell--together, those three have spent nearly a half a century combined working for Goldman When it comes to our economy, this isn't the Trump administration; this is the Goldman Sachs administration.[[Page S5197]]  Now President Trump has lined up another top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, who has been nominated to serve as the Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Mr.Hassett hasn't worked at Goldman No, his ``fresh perspective'' is that he has spent his career advocating for policies that favor the wealthiest  The Council of Economic Advisers plays a critical role in developing this country's economic policies. It was created by Congress to, as Hassett has put it himself, give the President ``unbiased, scientific, and objective advice'' about the economic impact of the President's policies on the American economy. They have their fingers in all sorts of policies from trade to healthcare, to taxes, to financial regulation.  So what kind of an economy does Hassett want? He hasn't been shy in telling us. Hassett wants an economy that keeps working great for those on top, and if it leaves working families further behind, that is just too bad.  Start with taxes: Hassett gets really excited about cutting taxes on giant corporations. In fact, when he was working for Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign, he wrote that the new President's top priority--the 1 act, the first thing he should do when he stepped into the Oval Office--was cut the corporate tax rate. His argument was that if we cut taxes for big businesses, they will give those savings to their workers and be more productive, improving the economy for everyone. That is just plain old trickle-down economics: Give more money to corporations and the wealthy, and they will surely pass it along to everyone else. It hasn't worked so far, and it isn't going to work in the future. Well, it isn't going to work for anyone who isn't already wealthy. For them, that works great.  On trade, Hassett also sings the corporate tune. Hassett wants to double down on the same kind of trade agreements that enrich giant corporations and leave the workers eating dirt. Hassett embraces trade deals that make it harder for small businesses to compete, trade deals that weaken public safety, and trade deals that undercut environmental rules. Hassett's approach really makes one wonder: Does Donald Trump not know who this guy is, or does he just not care? Either way, it is American workers who will take another punch to the gut delivered by Team  And how about on financial regulation? Nine years ago, Wall Street brought the economy to its knees and had to be bailed out to the tune of $700 billion. The crash cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes. Congress then passed bipartisan financial reforms to stop another crisis. Hassett was not enthusiastic. In public, he called those new rules ``lamebrained'' and described the legislation as ``horrifying'' and ``the worst piece of legislation that I've seen in my entire life.'' He sounded the alarm that the financial reform ``needs to be repealed as soon as possible.''  He has since said that he regrets his tone. Tone isn't the problem here. The problem is what he said, not how he said it.  If Hassett has his way and Wall Street reform gets repealed, the same behavior that caused the 2008 financial crisis would be unleashed again. I cannot understand how, just 9 years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Hassett would want to turn the banks loose so they have a clear shot at cheating consumers and building up risks that could blow up the financial system again.  There is no end to Hassett's bad judgment. He is wrong on the minimum wage, calling the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour ``wrongheaded'' and saying that raising the minimum wage was a ``dishonest approach'' to alleviating poverty.  He is wrong on the environment. In a column, he advised President Obama to ``frack away.''  And, most of all, he is wrong about the fundamental problems in our economy, calling income inequality a myth and saying it was ``ludicrous'' to believe that our society is ``rigged or fundamentally unjust.'' He sounds as if he thinks that it is just great that this economy works for those at the top and pretty much for no one else.  Hassett has consistently advocated for the interests of corporations over working people. If he is confirmed, I am confident that he will be one more voice in the White House speaking up for the rich and the powerful. No doubt he will fit right into the Goldman Sachs administration.  But Congress has a say in this.

862,topic-id,2611,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in support of the National Defense Authorization  The Defense bill has a long tradition of bipartisan cooperation, and I was glad to join in that tradition as part of the Armed Services As with any far-reaching legislation, there are a number of provisions in this I support and some I do not, but, on the whole, this bill is a win for national security and a win for  Massachusetts has a lot to offer our national security. Each of our military bases is unique in making vital contributions to our defense. The Massachusetts National Guard has a proud history, dating back to 1636, and it contains the oldest units of the U. Today we are proud of our military tradition, and we have a unique ecosystem of universities, industries, startups, and military labs, all focused on the next-generation needs for our warfighters. Research and development is critically important to this effort. It will literally save lives. I have made research funding a major priority, and I am very pleased we have secured an additional $45 million in funding for the Army's Basic and Applied Research accounts, for places like Natick, where researchers are doing cutting-edge work to better protect our soldiers. Overall, the bill increases funding for science and technology $250 million above the President's budget.  The bill also recognizes the critical role that MIT Lincoln Lab plays in national security research, and supports the construction of a new advanced microelectronics integration facility that will begin in 2019. It also fully funds the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx, which is doing[[Page S5207]]great work connecting DOD with innovative startups in Cambridge and around the country.  Our military bases, which are the lifeblood of their communities in Massachusetts, are also receiving much needed facility upgrades. Hanscom Air Force Base will receive $11 million to build a new gate complex that will dramatically improve its security. Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee will receive more than $60 million to construct a new maintenance facility and build a new indoor small arms range to improve readiness. Natick Soldier Systems Center will receive $21 million to improve family housing facilities, bringing our families working at Natick closer to the base.  All three of my brothers served in the military, and I know the demands of the military can be hard on families and on servicemembers. I have spent a lot of time over the last 9 months working hard with both Republican and Democratic Senators to do everything I can to help improve the lives of our military personnel and their families. I partnered with Senator Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, to introduce the Leadership Recognition Act, which has been incorporated into this larger Defense bill. Our proposal ensures that our servicemembers get the pay raises they deserve.  Over the last 15 years, Congress directed the Pentagon to raise military pay so it was more comparable to civilian wages, but it also gave the President the authority to waive the requirement to raise military pay. Unfortunately, that keeps happening, and military families who are already sacrificing so much don't get the pay raises they are entitled to.  Our new provision restricts the use of this waiver. We promised our military their regular pay raises in line with inflation, and they ought to get those raises, period. This one is a no-brainer. I am sorry it is taking Congress so long to get it done, but we are there now.  The Defense bill also includes my Service Member Debt Collection Reform The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has identified how unscrupulous debt collectors often take advantage of military personnel, for example, by alleging that servicemembers owe disputed or imaginary debts and sometimes even by contacting a servicemember's commanding officer to intimidate a servicemember into paying a debt they don't owe. This is outrageous. My provision requires DOD to review and update its policies regarding harassment of servicemembers by debt collectors.  Our military personnel are also entitled to educational benefits that can help them earn a degree or transition to civilian life. However, too often military members don't actually use these benefits because they can't navigate a frustratingly complicated and bureaucratic application process. That is why I offered an amendment to the NDAA to make sure DOD works with the Departments of Education and Veterans Affairs to automate the application of student loan benefits available to military borrowers. These Departments can use this information that already exists in Federal databases to expedite student borrower benefits for servicemembers, and there is no reason we shouldn't just do that right away. This will make life a little easier for our vets, and it will help put many of them on the road to a better education and higher earnings for the rest of their lives.  There is another problem in our military that we need to address. I was appalled earlier this year at reports that some male servicemembers shared nude photos of their fellow female servicemembers without consent, and harassed them on a website called Marines The military is not immune to the rise of so-called revenge porn online. Make no mistake, revenge porn is sexual harassment. DOD concluded in a May 2017 report that such harassment can lead to sexual assault.  Just last week, I sat with women in Massachusetts who had been sexually harassed and sexually assaulted during their time in the military. They volunteered for the military out of a deep sense of patriotism, and now they are struggling hard to come to terms with what happened to them. Their sense of betrayal--betrayal by their fellow servicemembers--ran deep.  Acts like these are deeply wrong, and they undermine unit cohesion and readiness. The Marine Corps and other services have taken some positive steps in response to the website scandal, but military prosecutors need the tools to combat this specific behavior.  Commanders have always had the ability to prosecute disorderly conduct, but the Uniform Code of Military Justice does not explicitly prohibit nonconsensual photo-sharing in all cases. To solve this problem, I teamed up with Senator Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, to introduce the Protecting Servicemembers Online Our proposal closes the revenge porn loophole, making it unlawful under the UCMJ for military personnel to share private, intimate images without the consent of the individual depicted. It does this by balancing privacy protections and survivors' rights, and I am grateful this year's Defense bill takes similar steps to address this revenge porn problem. There is more to do to make sure each person who signs up to serve our country is treated with dignity and respect, but this is a positive step.  This year's Defense bill also addresses an issue which is very personal to me--how we care for victims of terrorist attacks. I had been a Senator for only 3 months when the twin explosions went off at the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, killing three people and wounding hundreds more. I was on a flight from Boston to DC when the bombs went off. I didn't even leave the DC airport. I just caught the next flight back to  The next day, I met with Jessica Kensky and Patrick They had been recently married. When the bombs went off, they were both seriously injured. Each had a leg amputated at the scene. They were rushed to separate hospitals, where they underwent more lifesaving treatments and where Jessica lost her other leg.  When I first saw Jessica, she still had gravel and glass embedded in her skin--injuries the doctors hadn't yet cleaned up. She was grateful to be alive, but worried about When I first met Patrick, he had the same question: How is Jessica?  The Boston hospitals at which they received emergency care are among the world's best, and they saved many lives on that day, but those hospitals don't specialize in the long-term recovery from such complex and serious injuries like limb amputation. For that, you need military hospitals, like Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, but right now, access to Walter Reed requires a special exemption from the Secretary of Jess and Patrick say they owe their recoveries to the doctors, physical therapists, and prosthetic lab technicians who treated them at Walter Reed and who have treated thousands of troops since 2001.  Earlier this year, Senator Collins, a Republican from Maine, joined me in introducing the Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes Act, which would allow all victims of terror attacks to receive treatment at military medical facilities if there is space available. I hope we will never see another attack like the Boston Marathon bombing, but this bill will help us be ready if it happens.  I am glad the Defense bill includes language to implement the policy in our bipartisan bill, and I am particularly thankful to Senator Collins for working with me so other victims of terrorist attacks will be able to access our world-class military medical facilities if they need them the way Jessica and Patrick did.  The work on servicemember pay, GI student loan benefits, and help for civilian victims of terror made me proud to be in the U.At the same time, I worked hard this year to ensure the Defense bill contains a number of provisions that will strengthen our national security.  Like my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, I am concerned about Russian aggression. Too often this year, this issue has been obscured by partisan sniping, and it shouldn't be that way. Russia's attempts to sow global instability are a major national security threat, and on the Armed Services Committee we have treated it that way.  Earlier this year, I introduced the Countering Foreign Interference with Our Armed Forces This bill contains two provisions--one requiring annual reports on the new and disturbing trend of Russian efforts to target our military personnel with disinformation[[Page S5208]]campaigns and a second bill in response to the Michael Flynn scandal so DOD will be required to report to Congress when a retired general officer requests permission to accept payments from a foreign government. We need to protect our military and our country from outside influence, and these are two steps we can take right now.  Another area which concerns me is the money we spend to outfit our military. The DOD buys a lot of goods and equipment, which means it pays an extraordinary amount of money to government contractors. It shouldn't be too much to ask those contractors to provide high-quality products at a reasonable price, to treat their workers decently, and to knock off any efforts to extort extra profits out of the government. I am pleased the Defense bill also includes a number of my priorities to promote these kinds of reforms.  Step one in this process needs to be a full audit of the Department of DOD spending makes up half of the discretionary budget, and yet the DOD--unlike other government agencies--has never been audited. That makes no sense at all. Senator Ernst and I teamed up to fight for a provision to incentivize the Department to achieve audit readiness by mandating a pay reduction for the Secretary of each military service unit that does not achieve audit after 2020, and we got it passed.  Senator Perdue, a Republican from Georgia, and I joined together to press the Defense Innovation Board to study how we can improve the way the Department acquires software.  Senator Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, and I successfully fought for a provision requiring DOD to open source software methods and open source licenses whenever possible for unclassified, nondefense software, in accordance with best practices from the private sector. This one is particularly important so contractors can't shake down the Pentagon for new piles of cash every time DOD needs to upgrade and improve its software systems.  Finally, after stories about contractors with terrible safety records continuing to get DOD contracts, one after another, I successfully secured a provision that will require DOD contracting officers to consider workplace safety and health violations when they evaluate a potential DOD contractor. I introduced the Contractor Accountability and Workplace Safety Act to address this issue, and I am very glad it has been included in the  This Defense bill isn't perfect. I don't agree with all of it. In a Republican-controlled Congress, I wouldn't expect to agree with all of it. For one thing, I vehemently disagree with the decision to authorize funding for research and development for a new generation of intermediate-range missiles. Everyone knows the Russians have violated the INF treaty already, but that is not a reason for the United States to violate this core anti-nuclear proliferation treaty as well. Our military doesn't want it. Our European allies don't want it. Even the White House doesn't want it. We obviously don't need it. In a world of limited resources, spending tons of taxpayer money to build an unnecessary weapon that will make all of us less safe is a terrible idea.  I also disagree with the committee's recommendation to zero out the funding for the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, otherwise known as WIN-I have listened to the critiques of this system, but WIN-T Increment 2 is the only tactical communications system the Army currently has that permits communications on the move. GEN Mark Milley, the Army Chief of Staff, has noted the importance of remaining mobile on the battlefield. ``If you stay in one place longer than 2 or 3 hours, you will be dead,'' he said. We should improve WIN-T, not junk it, and we definitely shouldn't abruptly cancel this program without having any earthly idea of what will replace it. Fortunately, this program is not zeroed out in the House version so I will continue to fight for this during the House-Senate conference.  Finally, I am concerned about the overall increase in defense spending contemplated by this bill, particularly when there is no real plan in place to pay for it. The Defense Department is not the only agency that is critical to our national security, and most of those other agencies are under attack in this Moreover, it is important for us to make the investments we need here at home, to do things like address climate change and promote resilience after natural disasters, to invest in scientific research and discovery, to improve access to healthcare and education, to build new schools, and to repair aging roads and bridges. We cannot support a buildup in military spending that leaves our country weakened and unable to build a strong economy going forward.  Fortunately, the bill we are putting forward today merely authorizes new defense funding. Actual dollar amounts for Federal spending will be determined later this year for all of our agencies as part of the appropriations process. At that point, all spending--defense and nondefense--will be on the table at the same time. If that process is going to serve the American people well, it must provide for significant increases in spending on education, infrastructure, basic research, and the other building blocks of a strong country with a vibrant future.  I commend the leadership of Senators John McCain and Jack Reed throughout this process. Our committee has a long history of bipartisanship, and Senators McCain and Reed have continued that proud tradition. This legislation supports our servicemembers and their families, promotes commonsense Pentagon spending reforms, advances cutting-edge defense research, and bolsters the Commonwealth's innovation economy. Most importantly, this NDAA will make a real, positive impact on the lives of For those reasons, I intend to support it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Arkansas Congressman French Hill's bill, H.2611, that will modify the boundary of the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site to include seven residences on South Park Street in Little Rock,  While this bill would authorize the National Park Service to enter into cooperative agreements with private property owners of the South Street properties, H.2611 will do more.

They proved to the world that, as Americans, we really do believe the Declaration of Independence when it says that all men are created equal.  I believe that allowing the historical residences surrounding Little Rock Central High School to slip into disrepair or oblivion would be a severe injustice to those who gave of themselves to further the cause of civil rights and equality.

This amendment is nearly identical to one I offered to the DHS division of this bill that unanimously passed by voice vote last week that related to the Coast  Today's amendment would bar the National Marine Fisheries Service from enforcing the ban on striped bass fishing in the Block Island Sound Transit Zone, a 15-mile stretch of water between Montauk Point, New York, and Block Island, Rhode  No other species of fish are subject to an arbitrary ban in this section of Block Island Sound, famous for fishing and recreational boating.  The fact that the transit zone is considered a part of the EEZ means the ban on striped bass fishing extends into this local waterway. This means hardworking commercial fishermen, charter boat captains, and recreational anglers enjoying a day on the water with their family can suddenly go from fishing for striped bass legally to committing a Federal crime because they are drifted over the 3-mile line.  This ban was meant for the high seas, not a local waterway, arbitrarily declared to be part of the EEZ due to a boundary drawn on a map by a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.[[Page H7266]]  Every other species of fish popular in this area--scup; eel; squid; bluefish; even striped bass' cousin, black sea bass--are not subject to an unfair ban in this area. Just like they can legally with proper permits and allocations in adjacent State waters, local fishermen should be able to legally fish for striped bass in this area after State waters end and the transit zone begins.  Mr.Chairman, on the East End of Long Island, the coastal economy is our economy.
