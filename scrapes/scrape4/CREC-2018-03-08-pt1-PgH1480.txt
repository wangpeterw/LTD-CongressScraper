                         REMEMBERING TOM BERNS

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise, today, to remember 
Tom Berns, a friend and respected community leader, who passed away 
last month.
  After graduating college, Tom established the firm Berns, Clancy and 
Associates, which has grown into one of today's premier engineering 
firms in the area. Over the course of his career, Tom was considered by 
many to be an expert in civil engineering. He found great joy in his 
profession and shared it with others through teaching.
  However, Tom is, perhaps, most known for his impact on the community. 
He was a member of over a dozen clubs, boards, and civic organizations, 
many of which he served as president or chairman. He served as village 
engineer for five different central Illinois towns throughout his 
lifetime and was also actively involved in his congregation, St. 
Patrick's Roman Catholic Church, for over 50 years.
  In 2000, Tom became a Member of the Illinois House of 
Representatives, where he represented Illinois' 104th House District.
  Tom knew what it meant to serve. He lived his life in a way that put 
others before himself, always looking for ways to help, to get 
involved, and to improve his community.
  I am inspired by the legacy of Tom Berns and the numerous lives he 
touched throughout central Illinois. I pray for his wife, Jeannie, and 
their family during this difficult time.
