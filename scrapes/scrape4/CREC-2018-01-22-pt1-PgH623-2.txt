                OPPOSING HOLDING HOSTAGE UNRELATED BILLS

  (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, for 3 years, I have waited 
for the moment here where I want to commend my colleagues in the 
Senate, the majority party, for exposing the fallacious argument that 
you can hold hostage unrelated bills before you pass spending bills.
  Frankly, we call upon them to pass the appropriations bills to fully 
fund the government through September.
  We in this body, last year, had passed all 12 separate appropriations 
bills, fully funding the military and other government functions all 
the way through September of this year. That needs to happen in the 
next 3 weeks, because we have only a 3-week extension that we voted 
for.
  I am proud that the American public saw the false arguments that are 
being used, particularly on the other side of the aisle, where the 
minority party holds hostage funding bills and demands concessions on 
other nonrelated legislation.
  If they want to filibuster stuff over there, first of all, make them 
do it so the American public can see it, which happened over the last 
few days, and make it related to the bill on the floor at the time.
