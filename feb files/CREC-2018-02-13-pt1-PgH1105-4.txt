                     SUPPORTING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my strong support for 
the Medicare Advantage program. I recently led a bipartisan letter with 
298 Members of the House to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, or CMS, urging them to preserve and strengthen Medicare 
Advantage. Millions of seniors rely on Medicare Advantage, and they 
need access to the high-quality healthcare plan choices that Medicare 
Advantage plans provide.
  CMS will soon be issuing final policy and payment updates. These 
changes will have widespread implications on Medicare beneficiaries 
throughout the country. Our letter calls on CMS to preserve the 
program's integrity and existing incentives for MA plans that will 
offer high-quality, efficient, and patient-centered coverage options 
for consumers.
  Mr. Speaker, the Medicare Advantage program covers nearly 19 million 
seniors across the country and provides care coordination, disease 
management programs, out-of-pocket spending limits, access to 
community-based programs, and additional supplemental benefits like 
vision, dental, and even prescription drug coverage.
  We need CMS to continue to strengthen and enhance Medicare Advantage 
for our seniors.
