                 ACTIVIST JUDGES ABUSE THEIR AUTHORITY

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, activist judges have joined liberal 
Democrats to stop President Trump's policies. Federal trial judges have 
abused their authority by issuing almost two dozen nationwide 
injunctions to block the Trump administration's actions. According to 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, these injunctions have far exceeded 
their historic use. In fact, the number of injunctions surpasses all 
those approved in the past 200 years.
  Nationwide injunctions encourage forum shopping by opponents of the 
President's policies who file claims in courts with liberal judges. 
These judges place their personal views and politics above the rule of 
law. They do a real disservice to the justice system.
  It is time to rein in these activist judges. The people's respect for 
the law is at stake.
