                REINTRODUCING THE SMART ENFORCEMENT ACT

  (Ms. DelBENE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, 26 States and the District of Columbia have 
legalized some form of marijuana, including my home State of 
Washington. Yet marijuana possession or use for any purpose is still 
prohibited under Federal law, leaving my constituents, including cancer 
patients, at risk of prosecution.
  That is why today I am reintroducing the State Marijuana and 
Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act, the SMART Enforcement Act. My 
bill will fix the conflict between State and Federal law by giving 
States a waiver from the Controlled Substances Act.
  It also resolves the banking issues currently forcing dispensaries to 
operate in an unsafe all-cash basis.
  These waivers will ensure people in States that have different laws 
from the Federal Government on marijuana are protected from 
prosecution, provided they meet certain requirements, because people in 
these States should not live in fear of unpredictable actions from the 
Attorney General and the Department of Justice on this issue.
