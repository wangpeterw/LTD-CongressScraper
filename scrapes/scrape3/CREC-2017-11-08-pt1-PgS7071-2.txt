                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God, our Father, help our lawmakers this day to do Your work 
faithfully and well. Prepare them to be sober-minded and filled with 
Your Spirit, accomplishing tasks that receive Heaven's approval. Lord, 
keep them from deviating from integrity as they strive to ensure that 
their conduct rightly represents You. May they live lives of holiness 
and goodness, being as kind to others as they would wish them to be to 
them.
  Lord, prepare us all to stand before You in peace without spot or 
blemish. As we pursue Your peace on Earth, lead us not into temptation 
but deliver us from evil.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
