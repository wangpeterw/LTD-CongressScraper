                  AN ADMINISTRATION MARKED BY STRENGTH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday marks 100 
days in office for President Donald Trump, an important milestone for 
Congress and this administration.
  Since being sworn in, President Trump has stood strong, upholding his 
pledge to protect the American people in the face of world threats. He 
has stood up to the dangerous regime in North Korea by supporting our 
allies in the region and deploying the THAAD missile defense system. He 
took swift, decisive action against the dictatorship in Syria by using 
military force and economic sanctions after the brutal dictatorship 
executed a chemical attack murdering innocent civilians.

  Additionally, the President has taken strong action to win the global 
war on terrorism by destroying ISIL-controlled tunnels in Afghanistan.
  I appreciate President Trump for being a strong President and a model 
of Ronald Reagan, promoting peace through strength. Congratulations to 
him on a remarkable first 100 days in office.
  I look forward to continuing to work with the President to protect 
American families while successfully creating jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
