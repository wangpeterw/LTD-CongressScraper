                   REMEMBERING FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, it is 
important we continue to remember the brave men and women who were 
killed while protecting us.
  Last year, 145 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of 
duty. One of these officers, Lesley Zerebny, 27 years old, was an 
officer with the Palm Springs Police Department. She was responding to 
a domestic disturbance call when she was gunned down. She was killed 
just days after returning from maternity leave and left behind a 4-
month-old daughter.
  Her fellow officer, Jose Gilbert Vega, was also murdered in the 
shooting. A devoted father, Vega was just days away from retiring.
  Of the officers killed last year, 10 were State troopers. One of them 
was Trooper Timothy Pratt of the New York State Police. Trooper Pratt 
was struck by a car as he was on the side of the road assisting a 
stopped vehicle. Pratt had 30 years on the job.
  Our law enforcement officers don't know what they will encounter when 
they respond to any call. We applaud them for the bravery and courage 
they display in the face of danger. Mr. Speaker, let us not forget 
their sacrifices.
