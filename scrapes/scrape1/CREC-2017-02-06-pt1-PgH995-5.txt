                         A BEACON OF DEMOCRACY

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, in our country, political enemies do not 
disappear in the dark of night or become, mysteriously, fatally ill. In 
our country, the press is separate from the government, and journalists 
do not find themselves jailed or out of business for writing articles 
with which the government disagrees. While the journalists are not made 
to write accolades about leadership or about whether they agree or not, 
I stand here in light of the President's words that were aired over the 
weekend that suggested that our country is comparable to Russia.
  In our country, laws and the Constitution are supreme, not just one 
person. The courts rule on our Constitution, not one leader. In our 
country, lawyers, advocates, and citizens are free to challenge the 
government and its leadership without fear of reprisals.
  Mr. Speaker, our country has been a beacon of democracy and freedom 
and hope for people all around the globe. I would suggest to the White 
House that it stop squandering that reputation with idle comments and 
dangerous actions.
