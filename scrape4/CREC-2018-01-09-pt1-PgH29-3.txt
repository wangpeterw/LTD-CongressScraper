House of Representatives:

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                                  January 3, 2018.
     Speaker Paul Ryan,
     The Capitol,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan: I write to inform you that I will resign 
     from the office of U.S. Representative, effective 5:00 PM 
     EST, Monday, January 15, 2018. For the past seventeen years, 
     it has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the 
     people of Ohio as a Member of Congress.
       I thank you for your leadership as Speaker and wish you all 
     the best in future success.
           Sincerely,
                                                Patrick J. Tiberi,
     Representative to Congress.
                                  ____

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                                  January 3, 2018.
     Hon. John R. Kasich,
     Riffe Center,
     Columbus, OH.
       Dear Governor Kasich: I am writing to inform you that I 
     will resign from my seat effective 5:00 PM EST, Monday, 
     January 15, 2018.
       It has been an unimaginable privilege to serve the people 
     of the 12th district of Ohio for the past seventeen years. 
     Throughout this time, I have been honored to have worked with 
     my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strengthen our 
     nation and improve people's lives. However, I am equally 
     proud of the outstanding constituent services my office has 
     provided to help countless central Ohioans solve myriad 
     problems with the federal government. Public service is a 
     sacred trust with those we represent, and I hope I have been 
     able to make a difference in people's lives.
       It was a distinct honor to succeed you in Congress, and 
     thank you for your leadership as governor to make Ohio an 
     incredible place to live, work, and raise a family. I wish 
     you all the best in continued success.
           Sincerely,
                                                Patrick J. Tiberi,
     Representative to Congress.
