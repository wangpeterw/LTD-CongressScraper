                         LAKE TRAVIS CAVALIERS

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2016 Lake 
Travis Cavaliers on winning their sixth State championship in Texas. I 
am proud to say that the L.T. takeover of class 6A high school football 
is complete.
  The Lake Travis Cavaliers, led by their head football coach, Hank 
Carter, defeated The Woodlands in grand fashion by a score of 41-13. 
Coach Carter has assembled a great coaching staff and built Lake Travis 
into one of the best high school football programs in the State of 
Texas. I look forward to seeing what the program will continue to 
accomplish in the coming seasons under Coach Carter's leadership.
  I would also like to congratulate senior quarterback Charlie Brewer 
who was the Texas Associated Press Sports Editors' high school player 
of the year. Charlie led the offense to a big win and finished the 
season with a record-breaking 75 percent completions. I wish Charlie 
and the rest of the seniors the best of luck in their future endeavors.
  This season will go down in the history books for Lake Travis High 
School. Great job to Coach Carter and the 2016 team.
  Mr. Speaker, Texas is the greatest football State in America, and 
because Lake Travis High School is the greatest team in Texas, it most 
certainly must be the greatest high school team in the country, if not 
the world if you ask me.
  Go Cavaliers. In God We Trust.
