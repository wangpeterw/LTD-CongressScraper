                      HONORING SHANTHI VISWANATHAN

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mrs. Shanthi 
Viswanathan, a teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 
Parkland, Florida, whose quick thinking saved lives.
  As the second alarm went off that day, Mrs. Viswanathan knew 
something was wrong and she locked the classroom door, telling her 
students to take cover.
  When the SWAT team arrived and asked her to let them in, she would 
not because she didn't want to risk falling for a gunman's trick. 
Instead, she told them: ``Knock it down or open it with a key.''
  When Mrs. Viswanathan knew there was danger, she exemplified the 
truest form of the Hindu concept of dharma, of duty, in protecting 
those she was responsible for.
  These actions were brought to my attention by the Hindu American 
Foundation, which continues to support the victims of the shooting as 
part of their broader commitment to Ahimsa, the Hindu concept of 
nonviolence.
  They have also pursued various measures of gun control, which I 
wholeheartedly support. I commend them for their efforts here.
  Thank you to Mrs. Viswanathan and the Hindu American Foundation for 
their exemplary work and for making America a better place.
