                     HONORING LARRY EARL ROBERTSON

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women 
who deliver the mail in rural America. The work is not easy. As the 
National Rural Letter Carriers' Association notes, these carriers are 
essentially post offices on wheels, providing many of the same services 
to rural residents that urban dwellers take for granted.
  One such rural carrier was Larry Earl Robertson from Jessieville, 
Arkansas. Larry was my mailman for more than 25 years and, as many 
rural letter carriers throughout our country can attest, he was a part 
of our family. He knew my wife and children, just as we knew his 
family. He was an integral part of our community and played an 
important role in the lives of rural Garland County residents. Simply 
put, Larry was a friend to everyone. Just as Larry was a friend to all, 
he was also a faithful Christian and family man.
  Through his service--at just 54--he had made an important and lasting 
impact on his community, as many rural letter carriers do. That is why 
it was especially sad when we received word of his untimely passing 
last week. In the pain and grief of death, we take comfort in the words 
of Christ who said: ``I am the resurrection and the life. He who 
believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.''
  May we all strive to do our jobs with diligence and a smile and 
positively impact our communities as Larry Robertson impacted his.
