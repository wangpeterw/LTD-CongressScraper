              RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON ETHICS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
resignation as a member of the Committee on Ethics:

                                     House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 2018.
     Speaker Paul D. Ryan,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan: In light of media reports with regards 
     to a settlement reached between my office and a former 
     employee, I hereby resign from the House Committee on Ethics 
     effective January 20, 2018.
       Throughout this process, I have been in communication with 
     the Committee and sought to handle a difficult matter 
     ethically, appropriately and in accordance with guidance 
     issued by the Committee. All actions were taken on the advice 
     of the House Employment Counsel and I firmly deny the nature 
     of the allegations made in this claim.
       However, with a great respect for the integrity of the 
     Committee, and the absolute need for any subsequent 
     investigation of this matter to be beyond doubt and above 
     reproach, I feel it is best for me to remove myself from the 
     Committee at this time.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Patrick Meehan,
                                               Member of Congress.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is 
accepted.
  There was no objection.

                          ____________________
