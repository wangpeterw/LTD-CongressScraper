                  EL DORADO FURNITURE 50TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize 
El Dorado Furniture, a family-owned business in my congressional 
district celebrating its 50th anniversary.
  El Dorado was founded by Manuel Capo and his two sons Luis and Carlos 
within a year of arriving to the United States after fleeing Cuba due 
to the rise of the evil Castro regime.
  They deemed it only appropriate to name their store El Dorado named 
after the small boat upon which they sailed to freedom to our lovely 
country.
  Today, there are 14 locations throughout Florida, and it is 
recognized as the largest Hispanic-owned furniture retail business in 
the country. Not only does this company provide hundreds of jobs, but 
it also partners with numerous organizations in order to give back to 
the community and to those in need.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating El Dorado Furniture's 
50th anniversary, and congratulate the Capo family, and wish them all 
the best and continued success in the years ahead.

                          ____________________
