                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAVES LIVES

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, from the mother of four with a 
preexisting condition to the family of a young boy who can now afford 
health insurance for the first time--we have heard constantly and over 
and over how the Affordable Care Act has saved lives. The Affordable 
Care Act provides quality, affordable insurance to millions of 
Americans.
  For example, just in my district alone, nearly 100,000 people who are 
now covered through the Covered California exchange or through the 
Medicaid--which is in California Medi-Cal--expansion, they stand to 
lose coverage if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.
  It is completely irresponsible to speak about repealing the 
Affordable Care Act with no replacement. I urge my colleagues to think 
about their own constituents before doing so.
