         LIGHT UP STATE COLLEGE ATTEMPTS GUINNESS WORLD Record

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as the mercury dropped to 
record lows this week in Pennsylvania, I rise tohighlight an upcoming 
cold-weather event in State College, Pennsylvania.
  The Light Up State College will attempt to break a Guinness World 
Record next month by lighting more than 3,000 iceluminaries on Allen 
Street between College Avenue and Beaver Avenue at 6 p.m. the first 
Saturday in February.
  Now, you may ask: What is an ice luminary? According to Guinness, ice 
luminaries are cup-shaped structures made purely outof ice that hold a 
light inside. Those interested in helping break this record can pick up 
a do-it-yourself ice luminary kit indowntown State College.
  The current world record contains 2,561 separate lanterns and was set 
in 2013 by the residents of a small town in Sweden.They have been 
making ice luminary lanterns to coincide with a nearby winter market 
for the past 10 years.
  Light Up State College is a partnership of three groups: Centre 
Foundation, Make Space, and the Knight Foundation.Organizers have asked 
individuals in State College to commit to making ice luminaries, as 
more than 2,000 are still needed tohelp put State College over the line 
and on the map in the Guinness Book of World Records. This record-
breaking event will takeplace in State College on Saturday, February 4.
  I wish them the best of luck.
