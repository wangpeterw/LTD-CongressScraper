               SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRANTS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 
immigrants across our country.
  As an immigrant myself, I understand the sacrifices and hardships 
that immigrants experience. My parents sacrificed their very small life 
savings to send me to the United States at the age of 16 by myself to 
pursue college. That is why I stayed in my district last Friday to host 
an immigration roundtable with directly impacted constituents.
  Like many of us, Mr. Speaker, they have heard reports that this new 
administration intends to deport millions of people across our country 
rather than working towards a comprehensive reform of our immigration 
system, similar to the one that was passed in the other Chamber with 68 
bipartisan votes, unfortunately, never brought to the floor of this 
Chamber.
  I heard from children, Mr. Speaker, afraid to go to school out of 
fear that their parents will be taken away while they are at school. I 
heard from people whose lives are still in limbo because they have no 
idea what is going to happen next.
  But despite their fear, they still are ready to stand together and 
fight for their futures, and their courage and resilience is truly 
inspiring. We owe it to them to fight alongside them.
