                  HONORING RICHARD CULLEN OF VIRGINIA

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a fellow Virginian, 
Richard Cullen, who is in the midst of transitioning his law practice 
into ``becoming one of the boys'' again.
  Richard Cullen is a dedicated public servant who has served our great 
Commonwealth in different capacities during his longstanding career at 
both the Federal and State levels.
  Mr. Cullen was raised in Staunton, Virginia--located in our State's 
cherished Shenandoah Valley--and completed his education at the 
University of Richmond's T.C. Williams School of Law where he served as 
the editor-in-chief of the school's law review.
  Richard began his career at the Federal level with former Congressman 
Butler of the Sixth Congressional District. He continued to serve 
Virginians at the State level when he was appointed in 1991 as the 
United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
  Richard also served at the State level, from 1997 to 1998, as the 
attorney general of Virginia. He is a Virginian's Virginian who values 
his community.
  On behalf of our great Commonwealth, we thank Richard Cullen for his 
continued service.
