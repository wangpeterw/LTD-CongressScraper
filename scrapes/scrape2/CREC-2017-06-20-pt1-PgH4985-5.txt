                   TRUMPCARE IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, when President Trump calls your healthcare 
legislation mean and coldhearted, you know that it is time to 
reconsider your approach to the Nation's healthcare system. The 
President was referring, of course, to the House-passed TrumpCare 
legislation, which pulls the rug from under millions of Americans, 
raising their costs, gutting their protections, and, for many, taking 
away their coverage.
  And while we do not know the extent of the damage the Senate 
Republicans' secret health bill would cause, we do know its 
consequences would be disastrous. We do know, for instance, that the 
Senate Republicans plan to gut essential health benefits and destroy 
the Medicaid expansion.
  TrumpCare is fundamentally flawed. Higher costs, less coverage, fewer 
protections, that is the gift from the Republican Party to the American 
people. The bill would also destroy millions of jobs--nearly 14,000 
jobs in my State of New Jersey next year alone.
  TrumpCare is an ugly bill being advanced through an ugly process. 
Senate Republicans can hide the details from their bill, but they 
cannot hide that simple fact from the American people.
