                  CONGRATULATING REMEDIOS DIAZ OLIVER

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Remedios Diaz 
Oliver, a prominent member of our south Florida community, on her 
retirement from All American Containers.
  Remedios is a powerhouse. Along with her husband, Fausto, she 
established All American Containers, a multimillion-dollar business, a 
bottling company in Miami that serves corporations worldwide. Her son, 
Fausto, Jr.; her daughter, Rosie; and her grandchildren, Jackie and 
Fausto III, also work in the family business.
  Like me, Remedios was forced to flee the Castro regime in communist 
Cuba, and she has been an unstoppable commitment of force for the 
island's freedom.
  Remedios has been a trusted adviser to Presidents, to Senators, and 
to Members of Congress on the issue of her native homeland. And her 
advocacy in charitable events is second to none.
  Remedios has been a leader in the American Cancer Society, raising 
funds and awareness to assist those stricken with this terrible 
disease.
  While Remedios may be retiring from All American Containers, she is 
not retiring from our community, and I look forward to her next 
endeavor.
  I love you so much, my friend. Te quiero mucho, amiga mia. Thank you. 
Felicidades to Remedios.
