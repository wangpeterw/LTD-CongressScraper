                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi Richard Boruch Rabinowitz, Aish International, New York, New 
York, offered the following prayer:
  May we humbly ask You, God Almighty, to help us focus on the beauty 
and good of this great country.
  God, we thank You for giving wisdom to Presidents George W. Bush, 
Barack Obama, and Donald J. Trump for proclaiming May as Jewish 
Heritage Month.
  The Jewish people of this country are grateful and indebted to You, 
God, for the opportunity to contribute in making the United States a 
great nation.
  Aish founder, Rabbi Noah Weinberg, of blessed memory, would say to 
young people: ``When older people see your idealism, they might say, 
`you'll grow up,' but what they really mean is `you'll give up.' ''
  Rabbi Weinberg would say: ``Never give up--get tougher instead.''
  Let us pray for the Members of Congress and this great Nation: God, 
please grant us clarity and courage to always do right and never give 
up on our principles.
  God bless the United States of America.
