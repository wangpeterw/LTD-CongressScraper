               LET'S FIX THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TOGETHER

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her 
remarks.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a sincere suggestion to our Republican colleagues who are working 
hard to come up with a replacement for the replacement plan on health 
care that didn't fly.
  Let's fix the Affordable Care Act and work together in a bipartisan 
way. I have always said: the best legislation is always bipartisan. 
Drop your plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Stop 
undermining this law, and work with Democrats to make the law work 
better.
  That is what the majority of Americans want us to do. Millions of 
people now have health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. 
Insurance companies can no longer refuse to insure people with 
preexisting conditions, and essential health benefits like maternity 
care and mental health care are now provided.
  We know that no law is perfect. We acknowledge that. So let's do our 
job and do what the American public want us to do: join together in a 
bipartisan way to make the Affordable Care Act work better.
