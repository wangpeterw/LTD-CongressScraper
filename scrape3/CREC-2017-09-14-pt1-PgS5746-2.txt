     bargaining, legislative activities, and contributing to civic 
     and charitable organizations;

     through a century of achievements for the Federal labor 
     movement, including numerous reforms to workforce policy and 
     working conditions;
       Whereas NFFE members serve the United States by performing 
     critical functions throughout Federal agencies, including the 
     Department of Defense, the Department of Housing and Urban

     of Land Management, the Forest Service, the National Park 
     Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the General 
     Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, the 
     Passport Service of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, and the

       Whereas, through a partnership with the International 
     Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the 
     American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
     Organizations, the NFFE promotes better working conditions 
     and an improved quality of life for working families across 
     the United States;
       Whereas the NFFE represents more than 100,000 Federal 
     employees; and
       Whereas the NFFE continues to ensure that the voices of 
     Federal civil servants are properly represented: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates and honors the 
     National Federation of Federal Employees on the celebration 
     of the 100th anniversary of its founding.
