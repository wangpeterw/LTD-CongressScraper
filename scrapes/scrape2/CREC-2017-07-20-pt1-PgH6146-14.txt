            By Mr. GOSAR:
        H.R. 3333.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 (the Property Clause). 
     Congress has the power to dispose of and make all needful 
     rules and regulations respecting the territory or other 
     property belonging to the United States. By virtue of this 
     enumerated power, Congress has governing authority over the 
     lands, territories, or other property of the United States--
     and with this authority Congress is vested with the power to 
     all owners in fee, the ability to sell, lease, dispose, 
     exchange, convey, or simply preserve land. The Supreme Court 
     has described this enumerated power as one ``without 
     limitation'' in Kleppe v New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 542-543 
     (1976).
