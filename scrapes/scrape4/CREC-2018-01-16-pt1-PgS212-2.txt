                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2311

  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The bill clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2311) to amend title 18, United States Code, to 
     protect pain-capable unborn children, and for other purposes.

  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule 
XIV, I object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.

                          ____________________
