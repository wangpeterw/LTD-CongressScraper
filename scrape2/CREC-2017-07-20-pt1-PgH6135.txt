               HONORING THE MEMORY OF DIETRICH SCHMIEMAN

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory 
of a constituent and distinguished soldier in our Nation's Armed 
Services, U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman of Richland, 
Washington, who passed away on July 10, along with 15 of his fellow 
servicemen.
  Sergeant Schmieman served honorably as part of an elite Marine raider 
battalion stationed at Camp Lejeune and was on his way to complete his 
predeployment training in Yuma, Arizona, before being deployed to the 
Middle East.
  Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to individuals like Dietrich who, 
through their service, have preserved the freedoms that form the 
cornerstone of our Nation.
  Sergeant Schmieman's death is a tragedy. The hole he leaves in the 
lives of his friends and his family can never be filled. I join the 
Nation in sending prayers to his family during this very difficult 
time.
  Please join me in remembering Sergeant Schmieman and his dedication 
to selfless service to our Nation.
  Again, our prayers are with his family and his loved ones.
