            INDEPENDENT COMMISSION FOR RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, since last year, when our intelligence 
community concluded that Russia sought to influence our elections, we 
have seen a series of terrifying headlines. This has not stopped.
  Last week, we found out the President's son took a meeting in which 
he anticipated receiving from the Russian Government damaging 
information on the Democratic nominee. This was after it was spelled 
out in black and white in an email that the information came from the 
Kremlin. Donald, Jr.'s, response: I love it. But now we must go 
further. We need an independent commission, which Congress can 
authorize.
  Speaker Ryan, these issues go beyond party. They go to the heart of 
our democracy. The American people deserve the truth. Allow a vote on 
an independent commission before the August recess.
