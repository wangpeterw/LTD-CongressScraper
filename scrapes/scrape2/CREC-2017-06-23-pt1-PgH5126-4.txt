            CONGRATULATING THE DONEGAL WOMEN'S SOFTBALL TEAM

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Donegal 
women's softball team on their PIAA State softball title. They beat 
Cedar Cliff 9-7, but it wasn't an easy victory.
  Donegal trailed 7-3 heading into the bottom of the fifth inning, but 
never gave up. They scored six runs that inning to take a 9-7 lead, and 
they never gave that up the rest of the game.
  This team has been to the State tournament the last 4 years, but, 
obviously, this one was special. Donegal head coach Wayne Emenheiser 
said of the season: ``This was our dream since we lost last year in the 
semifinals. We wanted to get back here. It was a magical season.''
  A victory like this is a display of years of dedication and hard 
work. So today I want to congratulate the Donegal players, coaches, and 
staff on this remarkable achievement and let them know how proud we are 
of them.
  I would also like to recognize the families, students, faculty, and 
fans that supported them along the way.
