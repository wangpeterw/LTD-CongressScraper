        END HUNGER NOW: FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRESCRIPTION PROGRAM

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, my dear friend and colleague 
from Maine, Representative Pingree, hosted a panel discussion on the 
Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program.
  Experts from Wholesome Wave, the American Heart Association, and War 
on Poverty--Florida briefed congressional staff on how we can improve 
health outcomes for people living in poverty by increasing access to 
healthy, fresh produce. It is a simple concept with incredible results.
  Currently, healthcare providers at 34 clinics across 10 States 
provide individuals and family members with prescriptions for fruits 
and vegetables and $1 per day per family member to purchase these 
nutritious foods.
  The program has significantly increased food security among its 
participants and has enabled these families to increase their vegetable 
consumption by an astounding 206 percent.

  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Local FARMS Act, 
H.R. 3941, Representative Pingree's bipartisan legislation to expand 
the support and effort, and let us all work together to end hunger now.
