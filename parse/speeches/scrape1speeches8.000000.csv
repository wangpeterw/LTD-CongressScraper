My election would not have been possible without the efforts of Maya Angelou, Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, and many other sheroes who came before me. These women championed civil rights and women's rights and fought oppression so that African-American women could have a voice in politics.  When I was elected, I became the 100th woman to serve in the 114th Congress, the 20th woman in the Congressional Black Caucus, and only the second African-American woman to represent North Carolina in That night was a historic win for women, but it was particularly special for African-American women.  Shirley Chisholm once said: ``Women must become revolutionary. There cannot be evolution but revolution.''

The tide is turning, though.  On Friday, I will have the pleasure of participating in the March for Life rally to stand with the millions of people who are defending life across this country.  I am immensely proud to live in Arizona, a State that prioritizes the protection of the unborn. Since 2009, Arizona has passed 34 provisions to restrict or regulate abortions, and Arizona's abortion rate has concomitantly decreased 12 percent in those same 4 years. I appreciate the efforts of pro-life advocates across my district who have worked tirelessly to help countless women choose life for their unborn babies.  I look forward to working with President Trump and his administration on advancing pro-life legislation like H.7, which we passed out of the House today, and ensuring pro-life candidates for all Supreme Court vacancies and ultimately reversing that ignominious ruling, Roe v.

10078,topic-id,241,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, to improve employment opportunities for veterans and business opportunities for the companies that employ them, H.974 would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to consider how many veterans an offeror employs during a[[Page H1112]]decision to award a contract. Under this bill, the Secretary may give a preference to such employers based on the percentage of the workforce made up of veterans. It makes sense.  The bill would also allow the Secretary to debar any offeror who willfully and intentionally misrepresents the number of veterans they employ. I am glad that provision is in there.  Mr.Speaker, the unemployment rate among certain age groups of veterans still exceeds their nonveteran peers, and this legislation is one commonsense step to incentivize employers to bring veterans into their workforce and increase job opportunities for veterans of all ages.  I firmly believe that we should do all we can to encourage both small and large businesses to provide job opportunities for veterans as well as provide the Secretary the authority to consider such hires when making contracting decisions. This will further incentivize government contractors to make a positive investment in their companies by making investments in our Nation's veterans.

9819,topic-id,876,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I do rise today in support of S.34, which disapproves of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to protecting the privacy of customers of broadband and other telecommunication services.  I applaud Senator Flake's work on this issue, as S.34 was passed by the Senate last week. I also filed a companion resolution in the  The FCC finalized its broadband privacy rules on October 27, 2016. At that time, they assured us that the rules would provide broadband customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and stronger security protections for their personal information collected by internet service providers, but the reality is much different.  There are three specific problems with which the FCC has gone about these rules. First, the FCC unilaterally swiped jurisdiction from the Federal Trade The FTC has served as our Nation's sole online privacy regulator for over 20 years.  Second, having two privacy cops on the beat will create confusion within the internet ecosystem and will end up harming consumers.  Third, the FCC already has authority to enforce privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis. These broadband privacy rules are unnecessary and are just another example of Big Government overreach. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that Federal regulations cost our economy $1.9 trillion in 2015.  Since President Trump took office, Republicans have been working diligently to loosen the regulatory environment that is suffocating hardworking taxpayers.  Here is what multiple House Democrats said in a letter to the FCC last May regarding the FCC's privacy rules:       The rulemaking intends to go well beyond the traditional      framework that has guarded consumers from data practices of      internet service providers and ill-served consumers who seek      and expect consistency in how their personal data is      protected.  Further, FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright testified before Congress that the FTC has unique experience in enforcing broadband service providers' obligations to protect the privacy and security of consumer data. He added that the rules will actually do less to protect consumers by depriving the FTC of its longstanding jurisdiction in the area. Once again, these rules hurt consumers.  Incredibly, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to the internet as the most powerful and pervasive network in the history of the planet before these rules were even created. I found this really odd because it implied that the FTC regulation had indeed been successful and ought to continue, ultimately undermining his own rationale for additional FCC privacy regulation.  Now, there are a couple of myths that are going around that I want to take the time to dispel. Our friends claim there will be a gap for ISPs in the FCC privacy rules when they are overturned. This simply is false, and let me tell you why. The FCC already has the authority to enforce the privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis.  Pursuant to section 201 of the Communications Act, they can police practices of the ISPs that are unjust or unreasonable. Sections 202 and 222 also protect consumers. It is already in statute. So I encourage my friends to read title II of the Communications Also, the State attorneys general have the ability to go after companies for unfair and deceptive practices.  Third, litigation is another avenue consumers can pursue against ISPs for mishandling personal data. Service providers have privacy policies. If they violate the policy, guess what? They can be sued. I know Democrats will certainly understand that, as they have many trial lawyer friends, and I urge them to speak to the trial bar.  Fourth, the free market is another great equalizer. Can you imagine the embarrassment for an ISP that is caught unlawfully selling data? We have all seen the economic fallout from something such as a data breach. Companies have a financial incentive to handle your personal data properly because to do otherwise would significantly impair their financial standing.[[Page H2490]]  To my Democrat friends across the aisle, the bottom line is this: the only gap that exists is in these arguments that you have made.  Consumer privacy is something we all want to protect, and consumer privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create, as the Democrats Rush, Schrader, and Green indicated in a letter to the FCC last  I also want to speak, for just a moment, on the edge providers because there has been some question about who has visibility into your data. Clinton administration veteran privacy expert Peter Swire offered a report in February 2016 titled ``Online Privacy in ISPs.''  ISP's access to consumer data is limited and often less than access to others. Swire found that ISPs have less visibility into consumer behavior online than search, social media, advertising, and big tech companies.  Swire's study found that, as a result of advancing technologies, the rise of encryption, and the various ways and locations individuals access the internet, ISPs now have increasingly limited insight into our activities and information online.  By contrast, however, so-called edge providers, like search engines, social media, advertising, shopping, and other services online, often have greater visibility into personal consumer data.

10117,topic-id,336,"Mr.Speaker, my friend, Mr.Roskam, said you can't make things up. Well, unfortunately, people are. First and foremost, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are conflating accounts that are in the name of individual savers who don't have pensions that would be set up under these proposals, with what has happened with State and local pension plans and, frankly, private pension plans that got over their skis, that overpromised, that added to things. These are just the accounts that belong to individuals.  Now, the hypocrisy strikes me that my Republican friends want to strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act and turn it back to the Let them do with it what they will for Medicaid, for other local health programs. They think that is a great idea. But when governments on the State level like mine spent years developing a proposal that is innovative, that would protect people, that would involve no public tax dollars but at least engage people in a low-cost, transparent savings plan like we all have as Federal employees, then they don't want innovation, then they don't trust the States, then they want extra regulation that was never designed for programs like this.  I find it troubling that we would take a low-cost, high-impact program that has been developed in a number of States to help savers who have no program, that the private sector doesn't think they are important enough to invest in--or it is not worth their while--and strip that away. I think there is a reason why some business organizations, like the Chamber and other financial groups, are worried about this because this is a low-cost, high-impact, transparent program that will deliver benefits directly to employees. That is what more people should have.  I think they are afraid of the model and they are not willing to give the flexibility to the States in retirement that they are trying to do, throwing out the Affordable Care Act and having all sorts of innovation there.

10033,topic-id,481,"Madam President, I am proud to join my colleagues Senators Hirono and I thank them for their very impressive and steadfast efforts on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, during a time of tremendous uncertainty in our health care system, as, unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle work toward repeal of the Affordable Care Act without any replacement and any clear plan on what the alternative will be.  Not only would repeal of the Affordable Care Act impact children and families but most particularly our seniors who have worked hard and have earned the benefits of Any additional changes to the program that have been previously suggested by Republicans, whether changing the eligibility age or privatization, have no place in a reconciliation that has not been fully debated by the House and Senate and without a hearing from constituents and stakeholders about what those changes would mean.  That is why we are here in support of the very important amendment offered by my colleagues. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that full repeal of the ACA would increase Medicare spending by $802 billion from 2016 to 2025. This increase in potential[[Page S135]]spending could lead to higher Medicare premiums, deductibles, and cost sharing for beneficiaries.  Medicare, as it stands, as we all know, benefits our Nation's seniors who have worked hard and earned this program, but they would rather privatize or gut the program. So this action really should be decided not under reconciliation but by a 60-vote margin after hearings and an opportunity to be heard for our constituents.  Similarly, any replacement plan must not include fundamental or restrictive changes to the Medicaid The bottom line is, Medicaid continues to work to provide potential health care to our most vulnerable citizens. I come from a State that is truly making a commitment to make sure our Medicaid Program works. In fact, Connecticut was the first State to take advantage of the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, allowing the State to cover 72,000 more of our people in the State of  In Connecticut, the State has also utilized existing flexibility in the Medicaid Program to improve outcomes through the patient-centered medical home. As a result, in 2016, Medicaid hospital admissions decreased by 5.4 percent, emergency department visits fell 4.3 percent, and people requiring intensive case management saw a reduction of hospital inpatient admissions of nearly 40 percent.  These statistics are of staggering scope and scale and profoundly significant. We cannot make mean-spirited changes to the Medicaid Program, such as block granting, that would weaken the safety net, and we cannot allow gutting Medicare, endangering millions of seniors. We will not allow it without a fight. I am determined to join my colleagues in working and fighting for this amendment and keeping the pressure on our colleagues who disagree.  I yield the floor.

10058,topic-id,1399,"Mr.President, I am honored to be here tonight with my very eloquent colleague Senator Franken from Minnesota and also with two colleagues who will follow me shortly, Senator Schatz and Senator Markey, all of them great champions of better, more affordable health care for all the people who live in this great country.  This is the greatest country in the history of the world because we care about each other and we care about the common good. That is what the Affordable Care Act represents. It is not perfect. No great social reform ever is the first time around, including Social Security, but it can be repaired and improved without completely repealing it.  So repeal without a replacement is the height of irresponsibility. The first order of business for the Republican leadership during this session of Congress is to tear down and rip apart the Affordable Care Act, not to deal with job creation or economic growth. In fact, the Affordable Care Act provides 3 million jobs in our country, and repealing it would eliminate those jobs. No, it is to destroy and decimate a program that has literally saved lives, opened new futures, transformed the existences of millions and millions of Americans who would lose health care coverage if this measure is just repealed.  In fact, 22 million people across the country and more than 100,000 in Connecticut would lose that critical insurance. Preexisting conditions would become, again, an excuse for the health care industry and insurance companies to deny coverage. Women would be charged more simply because they are women. And young people would be denied access to their parents' health care coverage up to the age of 26.  Those kinds of losses just begin the list, but among the most egregious of the profound defects to this approach is the effect on the Prevention and Public Health I know it isn't a household term: Prevention and Public Health It is not exactly on everyone's tongue, but it is a measure that is profoundly important to the future of this Nation if you care about lives and dollars. And if you care about dollars, the $931 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund is allocated to provide funding for things like diabetes prevention, preventing healthcare-associated infections, chronic disease management, smoking prevention, lead poisoning, suicide prevention, and Alzheimer's disease prevention.  You may not consider these kinds of challenges--smoking prevention, lead poisoning, Alzheimer's disease, hospital-acquired infections--as the most glamorous, but treating them costs millions and millions and millions of dollars--in fact, billions of dollars.  Just to give you one example, the Tips From Former Smokers campaign, which the Prevention and Public Health Fund supports, has led to an estimated 1.6 million smokers attempting to quit smoking and has helped 100,000 Americans quit smoking. Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United The country spent $133 million on tobacco-related healthcare costs between 2000 and 2012.  I just made I think an error. I said $133 million. In fact, it is $133 billion. How easy it seems to confuse billions with millions--$133 billion by investing this kind of money from the Prevention and Public Health We can literally save tens of billions of dollars on smoking-related diseases and premature deaths.  Improving public health outcomes and preventing the public from getting sick and dying are important goals in and of themselves because the human suffering and the premature deaths they cause are important, humane causes to our Nation, a nation that cares about people. But the $1.3 trillion in treatment costs and lost productivity every year--let me repeat that--$1.3 trillion in treatment costs and lost productivity every year on chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke can be reduced and, dare I say at some point, reduced by so much that we may look back, and we will say: That Prevention and Public Health Fund was one good investment, but not if it is decimated and destroyed by the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which costs us money as well as lives.  In Connecticut, the fund has invested over $27 million in our communities since 2010, improving the lives and well-being of the people of Connecticut literally every day.  This strong investment has provided more Connecticut women with screenings for cancer, mammograms, other critical, preventive care, and it has given our State health department the ability to prevent diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and to fight obesity through improved physical activity.  It has allowed our State to address school health much more effectively, and we are talking about the Nation's children--preventing obesity, smoking, diabetes, which, as we know, more and more affects our children.  It has staved off disease outbreaks by providing Connecticut with millions of dollars to provide vaccinations for young people who otherwise would go without, children who would be denied this essential means of preventing emotionally crippling, if not physically debilitating, diseases that can transform their lives forever.  Perhaps most importantly, the Prevention Fund has relied on the communities impacted by the money for solutions. That means stronger collaboration between community organizations and the health system to prevent suicides, for example, in the Community Transformation Grants Program that encourages healthier lifestyles across our  The ACA, in short, has reflected a historic shift. We are trying to prevent, not just treat the disease, and that kind of investment from the Prevention and Public Health Fund in my State and many others has already produced a return on that investment which is of invaluable importance.  I have authored an amendment, which currently has 12 cosponsors, to create a budget point of order against any piece of legislation that would take away funding for preventive care. It is very simple. If we are going to work toward reducing the cost of health care in this great country, we should not be talking about getting rid of effective and efficient ways of preventing disease. We ought to be talking about reducing drug prices, stopping costly addictions, preventing disease, and improving the quality and efficiency of care.  I want to stress, again, the importance of reducing pharmaceutical drug prices, which has been a concern to me for years in this job and for many more years when I served as our State's attorney general.  But reducing health care costs and improving quality is not what our Republican colleagues are trying to do.[[Page S150]]They are trying to make good on campaign rhetoric and political promises to completely repeal the Affordable Care Act without any replacement, without following through on their commitment to provide health insurance to our Nation's people. We are expected to just wait and see what they have in the plan. Meanwhile, millions of people will be left without health care, and the health care industry will be in confusion and chaos as insurance companies wonder what comes next.  The simple fact is that our Republican colleagues have no idea, no clue, no plan. In their view, the Earth is flat. They can abolish something and promise to replace it because they know something will come. That is unacceptable, and I will fight to ensure that the Affordable Care Act continues to mean access to affordable health care for millions of Most importantly, fairness and effectiveness in health care means prevention. The Prevention and Public Health Fund is critical to that effort.  I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of prevention, safeguarding our health, and heed the voices and faces that have been so dramatic and powerful to me, so inspiring in their courage and strength, as they were just this morning when I met with and presented to the people of Connecticut at an event we did there. Three brave women came forward to talk about what the Affordable Care Act had meant to them and what its loss would mean as well. These perhaps not immediately visible voices and faces should be a stirring reminder to our colleagues that we need to do better, improve the Affordable Care Act, make it better--but not simply trash it, decimate it, destroy it, and abandon the great hope and ideal of assuring affordable care for all.

Working families in my home State of Oregon and across the country deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity. Unfortunately, that is not a reality for far too many Americans who face a growing retirement security crisis. In fact, nearly 40 million private sector workers, including an estimated 1 million in Oregon, do not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs.  The AARP and others have noted that people who do not save for retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net programs that increase costs for taxpayers.  Mr.Speaker, Congress has not stepped up to address our country's retirement security crisis, so several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and implemented innovative solutions that will help workers save for retirement.  Oregon's program is set to launch in just 5 months. Workers who do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer will have access to a plan facilitated by the It is not mandatory--workers can opt out--and there is minimal paperwork for employees. Oregon's plan is portable, so workers can keep their retirement savings when they change jobs.

Penny managed an apartment complex for low-income seniors, and she saw the hardships that residents faced without retirement security. Some lived on $10 in the last 10 days of the month.

Bobbie said:       Working with seniors in poverty, many care providers see      their own future every day. Once they reach retirement age,      they have to make the decision to live in poverty or keep      working until they die. Even if it[[Page H1207]]     means just $50 or $100 more per month, that kind of income      would make a huge difference to each and every one of us.  Penny, Bobbie, and people across the country need access to retirement savings plans. Oregon and several other States are working to fill that need. Congress should be supporting them and encouraging retirement savings programs like Oregon's and similar plans in California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Instead, House Republicans are advancing a Congressional Review Act joint resolution of disapproval that would endanger these plans, discourage other States from taking action, and undermine states' rights.  Specifically, this resolution would nullify an important Department of Labor rule that simply clarifies that these State-based savings plans do not run afoul of ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security The safe harbor rule went into effect last  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle may characterize this as ``closing regulatory loopholes'' and they may question whether more government is the answer, but that is not what this is about.  The National Conference of State Legislatures and the State treasurers of Oregon, Illinois, and California submitted letters in opposition to this resolution. They found the ``DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states, codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing retirement crisis facing this country.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record these letters and several other letters in opposition to this resolution.                                                February 10, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Speaker Ryan: Earlier this week, Tim Walberg and      Francis Rooney introduced two resolutions of disapproval      (H.Res 66, H.Res 67) to roll-back key Department of      Labor (US DOL) rules. These resolutions will limit our      abilities as states to provide solutions to the growing      retirement savings crisis, and could make it harder for small      businesses to participate in state-run programs.       We are writing to ask that you defend our state's rights by      voting ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.       The rule in question gives clarity for states across the      country to provide access to retirement savings options for      millions of private-sector workers. California, Illinois, and      Oregon are all in the process of implementing legislatively      approved state-administered plans that will enable nearly 8      million private-sector workers to save their own money for      retirement.       As Treasurers, we chair the respective Boards governing our      state plans and have been actively working with employers,      employees, payroll providers, and financial service      organizations for the last two years. The reality is, that      without access to an easy and affordable savings vehicle, far      too many workers risk retiring into poverty and becoming      overly reliant on Social Security or state and federal safety      net programs.       The final rule from US DOL provides key protections for      employers who facilitate enrollment for their employees--     confirming a safe harbor from ERISA and protecting businesses      from litigation or liability related to state programs--while      maintaining key consumer protections for program      participants.       While this rule has been finalized, opponents are seeking      to repeal or weaken the rule through the Congressional Review      We respectfully request that you oppose efforts to      repeal the rule and vote no on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.      The US DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states,      codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate      retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and      enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing      retirement crisis facing this country.       We are happy to provide additional information. Thank you      for your support.

Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of working Americans who      struggle to save for their retirement, AARP urges you to vote      against a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the      Department of Labor's final rule on ``Savings Arrangements      Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees''. AARP,      with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the      District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.Virgin Islands,      is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that      helps people turn their goals and dreams into real      possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the      issues that matter most to families such as healthcare,      employment and income security, retirement planning,      affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.       Today, 55 million working Americans do not have a way to      save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. Despite      decades of federal incentives, employer sponsorship of      retirement savings plans has remained static. The lack of      employer-sponsored savings plans has a direct impact on the      retirement readiness of workers, because employees are 15      times more likely to save if they have access to a payroll      deduction savings plan at work.       In response to the stubborn lack of growth in employer-     sponsored retirement savings plans, numerous states have      removed regulatory and operational barriers for small      businesses who want to offer a retirement savings vehicle to      their workers. These bipartisan, commonsense solutions are      known as Secure Choice or Work and In the last two      years more than half the states considered a variety of      options to provide employers and their employees with low-     cost savings options, including Arizona, California,      Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,      Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,      Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New      Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,      Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,      Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and       In 2016, the Department of Labor promulgated a rule      providing states with guidance on how to enter into public-     private partnerships aimed at increasing personal savings      rates among small business employees. This rule makes it      clear that any automatic IRA program established by a state      must remove the operational burden of running a retirement      plan from small business owners. In fact, it asserts that a      small business owner's only interaction with a Work and Save      plan would be to facilitate payroll deductions for these      individual savings plans.       A Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn this      rulemaking will have a significant chilling effect on states,      sending the political message that state flexibility is not a      priority. There is successful precedent for states to take      action to promote personal financial responsibility. When      college savings plans, known as 529 plans, were created      twenty years ago, less than $2.5 billion had been saved for      college in these programs. Today, individuals have put away      more than $253.2 billion for college in 529 plans. Similarly,      in the retirement context, states are acting as facilitators,      aggregating small businesses to get the cost benefit of      pooling. All private financial firms can bid to invest the      savings from employees. The only employer role is to set up      the payroll deduction and forward materials to employees, a      role employers already perform for unemployment insurance,      workers' compensation, and other similar programs.       Often, states are the pioneers of solutions. State      governments more directly interact with both workers and      employers, and state policymakers are aware that growth in      the number of older Americans who do not have a secure      retirement will be felt most acutely in cities and states. As      laboratories of change, states are often more willing and      able to test creative solutions to improve the retirement      security needs of their workforce while respecting the unique      characteristics and demographics of each jurisdiction. The      lack of options to save for retirement at work is a      persistent problem that demands action today. States desire      flexibility to move forward with innovative reforms--Congress      should not curtail state efforts to promote retirement      savings. Americans need easy savings options. No one wants      older Americans solely dependent on Social Employer      plans are not growing and states are trying to meet the needs      of their citizens using private investment firms. Lack of      access to workplace savings plans is especially acute for      people of color--only 54 percent of African American and      Asian employees and 38 percent of Latino employees work for      an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to 62      percent of White employees. Those who do not save enough for      retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net      programs, costing taxpayers down the line. In fact, states      taking action today could save taxpayers as much as $4.8      billion in the next ten years. Congress should support these      important state savings programs, not take steps to end them.       AARP urges Congress to support private retirement savings      and vote no on a Congressional Review Act resolution to      overturn the Department of Labor's rule on Savings      Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental      If you have further questions, please feel free to      contact me.

Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose H.     66 and H.67. These resolutions of disapproval      block Department of Labor (DoL) regulations that[[Page H1208]]     create safe harbors under which certain retirement savings      arrangements established by states or eligible political      subdivisions for private-sector workers will not be      considered ERISA-covered employee benefit plans.       While the vast majority of union members who work in the      private sector benefit from collectively bargained pensions      and retirement savings plans, over 38 million private-sector      workers are not offered any kind of plan at work. The DoL      regulations provide a path forward for states and      municipalities to create an easier way for these Americans to      begin building a retirement nest egg through payroll      deduction contributions into their own Individual Retirement      Account (IRA). A vote to rescind these regulations is a vote      to ensure that these Americans will remain financially      vulnerable in retirement.       Thank you for your consideration of our views.           Sincerely,                                                   William Samuel,     Director, Government Affairs                                  ____         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            Employees, AFL-CIO,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     U.House of Representatives,     Washington, DC,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to oppose the      two Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval      blocking the U.Department of Labor (DOL) regulations for      state and city retirement savings programs, H.Res 66 and      H.Res 67.       Using the CRA to overturn these rules is an example of an      arbitrary process that upsets years of work by federal      agencies acting in strict adherence to the Administrative      Procedures Act to promulgate important federal rules and      actions. After thorough consideration that has involved the      public, state and local governments, and the Congress,      resolutions of disapproval should not be used for partisan      purposes to scrap agency rules at the last minute and to      subvert the regulatory process contrary to real needs of            We know there is a growing retirement security problem in      this country. It is estimated that 55 million full- and part-     time private sector workers in the U.lack access to      retirement coverage through work. This problem has grown      unabated and without adequate attention at the federal level.      Finally, new DOL rules that are under attack will enhance      retirement security for the millions of Americans who do not      have access to pensions and have limited means to increase      savings for retirement. The new rules simply allow states and      cities to set up important auto-enrollment programs to      enhance savings if they chose to do so. One rule encourages      state auto-enrollment tax-free savings plans, or state-     created tax-free saving plans for private business. The      second resolution would block a rule that clarifies when      county and city auto-enrollment plans will be exempt from      federal retirement law. California and a number of other      states have either already adopted plans or are considering      adopting plans. In addition, cities such as New York,      Philadelphia and Seattle are also considering similar      measures.       These resolutions of disapproval would unfairly impact      these new plans and the millions who want to take advantage      of them. Approximately half of all workers lack access to any      type of pension or employment-based retirement savings plan.      The DOL regulation is narrowly tailored to authorize      governments to establish plans for those employers who do not      offer retirement programs. The burden imposed upon such      employers is minimal. Significantly, the regulation simply      clarifies that states and local governments can create auto-     enrollment programs. In the absence of the regulation, states      may still offer the programs, although the legal status is      uncertain. These regulations not only clarify the matter, but      provide some important protections for participants.       I urge you to vote no on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67, which      would harm these important state and local savings programs.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,     Director of Federal Government                                  ____                                               American Federation                                                  of Teachers,                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: For many Americans, the ability to      maintain their living standards in retirement continues to be      a source of anxiety and concern. Two-thirds of participants      in the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2016 Retirement      Confidence Survey indicated that they had no retirement plan,      and more than 50 percent reported they had less than $25,000      in retirement savings.       As a result, a large number of states are moving      legislation to help employees of small employers to access      retirement savings plans. The Department of Labor has      assisted this effort by excluding such plans from In      light of these facts, the AFT urges you to vote no on      Congressional Review Act resolutions (H.66 and H.     67) that would reimpose ERISA standards on governments      and only serve to chill state and city innovation.       Although most jobs are created by small businesses, most      small business workers are not offered any retirement plan.      According to the Center for Retirement Initiatives (CRI), 98      percent of all firms in the U.employ fewer than 100      workers, and about two-thirds of these workers lack access to      any retirement plan. Many small-business owners who were      contacted by the Government Accountability Office reported      shying away from sponsoring any retirement plan because of      all of the administrative requirements and fiduciary      responsibilities for selecting investment funds and managing      plan assets. Unless something is done to improve the      retirement prospects of the small-employer workforce, these      individuals will fall into poverty in retirement, and place      emotional stress on their families and financial stress on      their government sponsors.       In response to this retirement savings gap, a large number      of states have removed regulatory and administrative barriers      for small businesses that want to offer a retirement savings      vehicle to their workers. These bipartisan common-sense      approaches are collectively known as ``Secure Choice.'' In      the last few years, about half of all states have considered      ways to provide small employers and their employees with low-     cost, professionally managed savings options. Seven states      already have enacted legislation and are preparing to      implement their plans.       In 2016, the DOL promulgated an rule providing states and      cities with guidance on how to enter into public-private      partnerships, with the goal of increasing savings rates among      employees of small businesses. The rule clearly states that      an automatic IRA program established by a state or city must      remove the burden of administering the retirement plan from      small-business owners. The rule puts in place only one      requirement: Small employers that do not offer any other      retirement plan to their employees must offer a payroll      deduction for employees who voluntarily choose to participate      in the savings plan. In short, the DOL rule eliminates much      federal red tape, and gives governments more flexibility to      innovate. This allows states and cities to provide a glide      path for small employers to offer a retirement savings plan      to their workers.       Just as states facilitated the pooling and investing of 529      college savings plans in partnership with private investment      firms, the same convention is being employed in a retirement      savings context. Private investment companies can bid to      invest the pooled savings from employees of small employers.      Workers will enjoy the twin benefits of low-cost and well-     managed investments. Small employers are only required to      provide payroll deduction and forward the program information      to employees.       Again, the AFT urges Congress to support these state-     sponsored, public-private retirement savings programs--     collectively referred to as Secure Choice--by voting against      Congressional Review Act resolutions H.66 and H.     67.           Sincerely,                                                 Randi Weingarten,                                      ____                                               National Conference                                        of State Legislatures,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.       Members of The United States House of Representatives: The      National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the bi-     partisan organization representing the legislatures of our      nation's states, territories, and commonwealths, urges you to      vote against H.66, a Congressional Review Act      resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's final rule      on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-     Governmental Employees.''       As our nation's laboratories of democracy, states are      developing and implementing innovative solutions that will      improve the retirement security of private sector workforces      and that will also save taxpayers billions of dollars.      Passage of this resolution is an affront to those in Congress      who advocate for the 10th Amendment as it will result in an      unwarranted preemption of state innovation, will restrict the      ability of millions of hardworking Americans to save for      retirement, and will prove costly to federal and state      budgets.       As the number of workers who lack enough savings to cover      the costs of retirement expenses continues to grow, states      need the flexibility to develop creative solutions to this      problem. Restricting the ability of states to establish      private sector savings plans will put an even greater strain      on public finances because states and the federal government      are ultimately responsible for funding the social safety      programs that are utilized by retirees who are not      financially independent. Eight states have enacted laws that      will establish state-facilitated retirement plans' and many      other states are considering these plans for their state's      private sector workers. Passage of H.66 will likely      prevent states from establishing these innovative plans and      will result in increased costs for federal and state budgets      as tens of millions of Americans who depend solely on social      security will increase dependency on other entitlement      programs.       Finally, we challenge the argument that private sector      workers, who lack retirement options, should not depend on      their state governments to establish these retirement saving      programs. We ask members of Congress that if states did not      act to address this growing problem, who would? It was only      after years and years of failure by the private sector to      address the retirement of[[Page H1209]]     its small business workers that state governments were left      with no alternative but to provide an innovative solution for      these retirees' future. Congress should respect the states'      efforts to reduce a further financial burden on future      taxpayers.       NCSL urges Congress to support state innovation regarding      private retirement savings and vote no on a Congressional      Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's      rule on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-     Governmental Employees.''           Sincerely,     Senator Daniel Blue, Jr.,       North Carolina, President,     Senator Deb Peters,       South Dakota, President-Elect,                     Retirement Savings Fast Facts       Three-quarters of private sector workers feel anxious about      having enough money to live comfortably in retirement.       Fifty-five million Americans work for employers that do not      offer any form of a retirement savings plan.       80 percent of private sector workers between the ages of 18      and 64 support state-facilitated plans designed to help them      save their money for retirement.       State-facilitated retirement savings plans are designed      similarly to the popular 529 college savings plans, as the      plan's assets would be the personal property of the      individual saver, and their money could only be used to      benefit the individual saver.       State-facilitated retirement savings plans would be managed      by outside private sector fund managers and there will be no      connection between state-facilitated programs and public      pensions for government employees.       State-facilitated retirement savings plans would provide      employees the options to decline participation; however, data      suggests that employees with access to workplace retirement      plans are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.                                  ____                                  National Council of La Raza,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     Virginia Foxx,     Chairman, House Committee on Education & Workforce,          Washington,     Bobby Scott,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Education & Workforce,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of      the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation's largest      Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, I write to ask      you to oppose Res 66 and Res 67, resolutions of      disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to      block the Department of Labor (DOL) rules that allow states      and cities to implement their own Individual Retirement      Account (IRA) retirement plans.       In the absence of congressional action to increase access      to retirement plans, state plans have stepped up to innovate      and fill that gap. H.Res 66 and H.Res 67 impedes state      and local innovation and entrepreneurialism to solve the      retirement issue. If the DOL rules are abolished, it would      have a chilling effect on the states and cities that are      working to implement programs, including California,      Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon, which have all      passed legislation to setup these programs and New York City,      Philadelphia and Seattle which are currently considering      their own auto IRA plans.       Tim Walberg's (R-MI) H.Res 66 and Francis      Rooney's (R-FL) H.Res 67 would nullify the DOL rules that      offered the clarification necessary to help states and cities      implement their own auto-IRA plans consistent with The      Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),      which would provide millions of workers access to a workplace      retirement plan. If these retirement plans were to become      subject to ERISA, they would not be able to move forward.       One of NCLR's goals in 2017 is to ensure the successful      implementation of the California Secure Choice Retirement      Savings In September 2016, California Governor Jerry      Brown signed into law a bill that allows workers to access      state-run IRAs, which will feature automatic enrollment for      people working for employers with five or more employees.      Just over 7.5 million Californian workers who do not      currently have an employer-sponsored plan--half of whom are      Latino--will benefit from this program.                  Latinos Have a Strong Desire To Save       NCLR has worked to improve opportunities for Hispanics in      the United States for nearly 50 years. One of our core areas      of work is economic security, which is contingent on an      individual's retirement readiness. While many Americans have      difficulty saving for retirement, the issue is even more      acute for communities of color. For example, 62% of Black and      69% of Hispanic households lack any assets in a retirement      account. For those who can save, their account balances are      disproportionately low: four in five Latino households aged      25-64 have less than $10,000 in retirement savings, compared      to one in two White households. Prior to the DOL rule,      limited access to traditional retirement savings products      severely affected Latino workers' ability to invest in their      future. Efforts, whether at the federal or state level, to      increase access to quality retirement savings plans are      crucial to enhance Latino retirement readiness.       The difficulty in saving for retirement is the result of a      variety of factors, including lack of availability of      employer-sponsored retirement plans and lower rates of      participation in those plans when they are offered. Workers      of color have less access to retirement savings vehicles      compared to Whites: 38% of Latino employees aged 25-64 work      for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to      62% of White employees. Of those workers who have access to      an employer-sponsored plan, not all participate: only 29.7%      of Latino workers who have an employer plan participate      compared to 53.8% of White workers.       Low wages make investing for retirement especially      challenging given that housing, health care, and education      costs continue to rise while wages remain stagnant. 42% of      all Latinos earn poverty-level wages, even with having the      highest rate of labor force participation among all racial      and ethnic groups. Despite earning low wages, numerous      studies have shown that Hispanics value saving. A 2014      national Prudential survey of Latino consumers found that      ``the `saver' mindset prevails'' with However, while      53% Latinos think that saving for retirement is a high      priority, near-term financial needs often compete for limited      resources.       Limited access to traditional retirement savings products      severely affect Latino worker's ability to invest in their      future. Efforts to increase access to quality retirement      savings plans are crucial to enhance Latino retirement      readiness. In the absence of congressional action to increase      access, state and city plans can help to fill that gap. It is      for the above reasons that NCLR urges you to opposes      Res 66 and Res 67 and ensure that millions of workers      have access to a workplace retirement plan.

Service Employees                                          International Union,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members      of the Service Employees International Union (SEID), I urge      you to vote against H.Res 66 and H.Res 67, resolutions      disapproving of the Department of Labor's rules relating to      retirement savings arrangements established by states and      qualified state political subdivisions. The Department of      Labor rules make it easier for small employers to offer their      workers access to programs for retirement savings and achieve      an essential component of the American dream.       There is a retirement savings crisis in our country. Fifty-     five million workers do not have access to a retirement      savings plan at work. As a result, nearly half of all workers      have no retirement assets--no pension, no 401(k), and no      States have stepped in to begin to address this crisis with      innovative legislation that gives workers the opportunity to      set aside their own money in low-fee, professionally managed      savings accounts. Importantly, private sector money managers      and administrators will be hired to run these programs on      behalf of the states, generating American jobs. The      Department of Labor issued rules that clarified that      employers would not be subject to the fiduciary      responsibilities and reporting requirements of the Employee      Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) under these state      initiatives.       In addition to helping workers achieve a dignified      retirement, the state initiatives provide small businesses      with easy, low-cost access to a retirement savings plan.      Small employers are the least likely to offer retirement      savings plans because the cost can be prohibitive and the      ERISA requirements can be onerous at the start. The state      initiatives also are fiscally prudent actions that will save      public spending. A new study by Segal Consulting estimated      that state Medicaid costs would be reduced by $5 billion      within the first ten years of implementation of the state      plans. Those savings would grow exponentially over time as      more workers retired with greater amounts of savings.       Five states--California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland      and Oregon--have enacted legislation and will soon begin      taking payroll contributions. About half of states have      studied or are studying this concept. Massachusetts and      Vermont are considering legislation that would also allow      employer contributions. Contrary to misinformation being      spread about these plans, the program funds are not      guaranteed by the state, and state and participating      employers will have no liability for the payment of      retirement funds earned by the participants. These state      plans are bipartisan public/private initiatives that      appropriately use states as laboratories for innovation. They      are a win for workers, for employers, and for governments at      all levels.       SEIU is also deeply concerned with efforts under the      Congressional Review Act (CRA) to circumvent the Executive      Branch process of rulemaking and issuing regulatory guidance.      Using the CRA authority to undo Agency regulations and      guidance crafted carefully and with public input strips away      the importance of the rulemaking process. Using this      authority could significantly weaken or undo past and future      rules that protect workers.       SEIU respectfully urges you to vote against resolutions      H.Res 66 and H.Res 67 disapproving of these important      rules. We may add votes on this legislation to our      legislative scorecard. If you have any questions please      contact John Gray, Legislative           Sincerely,                                                   Mary Kay Henry,     International                                  ____                                      Small Business Majority,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.     Re House Joint Resolutions 66 and 67.     Kevin McCarthy,     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McCarthy: As a leading representative      of the 28 million small businesses in America, Small Business      Majority writes today urging you to oppose HJR 66 and HJR 67,      which would overturn the U.Department of Labor's rule      enabling states to establish retirement savings plans for      private sector workers. Striking down this rule would have a      chilling effect on states that are setting up their own      retirement savings programs, which would be harmful to small      businesses and their employees. We strongly believe states      should be allowed to decide whether to implement these types      of programs and how best to administer them in order to serve      small businesses and employees who struggle to save for      retirement.       The U.currently suffers from a retirement savings gap of      more than $6 trillion, and more than three million households      do not have any retirement savings at all. This lack of      savings for retirement disproportionately affects those who      are employed by small businesses. Eighty percent of workers      employed by businesses with fewer than 25 employees do not      have any sort of pension or retirement plan at all. This is      important because small businesses employ about half of all      private sector workers. Unless small business owners and      their employees start doing more to prepare for the future,      many Americans will not have enough money for their golden      years.       Small Business Majority's state opinion polling found small      business owners struggle to offer retirement savings programs      due to a number of barriers, but they want to offer this      benefit to their employees because it helps them attract and      retain talent. What's more, the majority of small employers      are concerned their employees will not have enough saved for      retirement. That's why small businesses overwhelmingly      support state efforts to establish state-administered      retirement savings programs, like the Secure Choice Savings      programs in Illinois and       When implemented, these programs will offer a convenient      and affordable option for small businesses and their      employees to save for the future. What's more, these programs      will not be funded by taxpayer dollars, and employers will      not contribute to funds, manage funds or have any      responsibility for financial advice for their employees'      investments.[[Page H1214]]       Business owners know offering benefits like retirement      savings create a happier and more productive staff, which in      turn leads to increased productivity. Many small business      owners think of their employees as family, so it's not      surprising they support programs that enable them to foster a      happier workforce while protecting their workers and their      bottom line.       Additionally, programs like these help level the playing      field between small businesses that want to offer retirement      benefits but can't, and their larger counterparts that can.      This helps small businesses compete for the best employees,      and gives employers peace of mind that they are doing what's      best for their workers.       Small employers need retirement savings options for their      employees that make sense for their business and their bottom      line. State-administered retirement savings programs, like      those currently being established in California and Illinois,      can help many small business employees better save for their      futures. We urge you to uphold the Labor Department's rule      and allow states to decide how best to serve their small      businesses and private sector workers.           Sincerely,     John                                  ____                                       Tuesday, February 14, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Speaker Ryan: Nearly 55 million workers across the country      lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, and      millions more fail to take full advantage of employer-     supported plans. Without access to easy and affordable      retirement savings options, far too many workers are on track      to retire into poverty where they will depend on Social      Security, state, and federal benefit programs for their most      basic retirement needs. States across the country have been      innovating to address this problem. We are writing to      respectfully urge you to protect the rights of states and      large municipalities to implement their own, unique      approaches.       Last week, two resolutions of disapproval (H.Res 66,      H.Res 67) were introduced to repeal key Department of      Labor (US DOL) rules. If passed, these resolutions would make      it more difficult for states and municipalities to seek      solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis. We ask      that you support the role of states as policy innovators by      voting ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.       Thirty states and municipalities are in the process of      implementing or exploring the establishment of state-     facilitated, private-sector retirement programs. Eight states      have passed legislation to allow individuals to save their      own earnings for retirement (no employer funds are involved      as these are not defined benefit plans). While most state and      municipal plans will be governed by independent boards, the      day-to-day investment management and recordkeeping would not      be conducted by the state, but rather by private sector      firms--the same financial institutions that currently provide      retirement savings products. These programs would apply to      businesses that don't currently offer a retirement plan, and      would in no way limit an employer's ability to seek out and      offer their own employer-sponsored plan.       Many states and municipalities are planning to use      Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) that will be wholly      owned and controlled by the participant, while others are      pursuing options such as Voluntary Multiple Employer Plans      (MEPs) and marketplace concepts. These plans would follow all      relevant guidelines and other noted regulations, and current      consumer protections would apply. Many of these programs are      modeled off of the 529 College Savings Plans or supplemental      public retirement plans that states administer today.       States are pursuing a multitude of solutions to address      this growing retirement savings crisis. We request that you      vote ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67 with the      understanding that the US DOL rule provides important      flexibility to states and large municipalities as they seek      to address the growing retirement crisis facing this country.      We insist that states be allowed to maintain their      constitutional rights to implement such legislation.       We are happy to provide additional information or answer      any questions.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: We are writing to strongly oppose      H.J.Res 66, which overturns the recent Department of Labor      rule supporting states' efforts to establish retirement      savings plans for non-governmental workers. As a national,      non-partisan Millennial research and advocacy organization,      we have been working hard to strengthen the financial      security of young adults by increasing access to retirement      savings plans. This legislation may have a chilling effect on      the implementation of Secure Choice, an important new program      that will help address the looming retirement crisis without      costing taxpayers a dime.       Changing dynamics in the workforce mean that Millennials      tend to work in industries that offer lower wages and fewer      benefits. Despite an interest in saving the small amounts of      discretionary income they do have, many young adults do not      have access to workplace retirement savings plans, including      less than half of low-income Millennial workers. Young adults      are significantly less financially secure today than their      parents were just one generation ago: 25-34 year-old      Millennials have half the net wealth and earn 20 percent      lower incomes when compared to 25-34 year-old Baby      Limiting access to tools for saving makes catching up      financially that much more challenging for this generation.       Many states have worked diligently for over four years to      develop Secure Choice, which will provide workers who do not      have access to a workplace retirement plan a simple,      voluntary, low-cost, and portable retirement plan. Experts      agree that direct contributions from a paycheck into a      retirement account is the simplest and most effective way for      individuals to save.       This is why support among Millennials for a state      facilitated retirement savings plan like Secure Choice is      extraordinarily high: over 85 percent of young adults across      political affiliation and ideology support ``a voluntary      option for workers without a way to save for retirement at      work.''[[Page H1215]]       We urge you to oppose H.J.Res 66 and allow individual      states to develop the tools young Americans need to save for      retirement.           Sincerely,     Young                                  ____                                             State of Connecticut,                              Office of the State Comptroller,                                  Hartford, CT, February 14, 2017.     Joe Courtney:     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington,       Dear Representative Courtney: I am writing to seek your      support in preserving and strengthening the rights of      Connecticut and other states to address a growing retirement      savings crisis that threatens our state and national economy.       I am proud that Connecticut is among the states leading the      way for retirement security. The Connecticut Retirement      Security Authority savings program will ensure that      retirement savings opportunities are more readily attainable      for the 600,000 private-sector workers who lack access to a      retirement savings plan through the workplace and who deserve      financial security after a lifetime of work.       According to Connecticut-specific data from the Schwartz      Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School,      between 2000 and 2010, employers offering a retirement plan      declined from 66 percent to 59 percent. In other words, four      out of 10 workers residing in Connecticut do not have access      to a retirement plan at work.       In Connecticut's market analysis conducted by Boston      College, we found that these uncovered workers were more      likely to earn lower income and are largely unserved by the      financial sector, so their needs are often different from      other 401(k) participants. It is important to protect against      a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top because high      fees on low dollar accounts are a huge obstacle to retirement      savings, particularly for lower income workers.       There is an entire generation of employees, many of them      lifelong hard-working middle class people, who are headed to      retirement financially unequipped, in part due to lack of      access to a workplace-based retirement savings option. This      is a problem, not only for those individuals and families who      are financially forced to delay retirement indefinitely, but      for our entire state and economy. In many cases, these      individuals may be forced to turn to the state for assistance      with health care, nursing care, food, housing, energy or      other costly services.       The goal is not to compete or replace the private market,      but to fulfill a significant unmet need in the market that      must be answered for the sake of those families and our      entire state economy. The market is currently failing to      reach nearly half of our workforce even though the demand is      there According to an AARP 2015 survey, 64% of small      businesses in Connecticut that were not offering a retirement      plan stated that they would take advantage of a state plan if      it were offered.       Connecticut was heartened by the U.Department of Labor      rule last August, providing a safe harbor for states to      conduct these programs. While we have been advised by several      ERISA attorneys that the U.Department of Labor rule was      not required, and that states already have the right to      establish such programs, the proposed bills nullifying the      U.Department of Labor rule and attempting to roll back      states' rights may create a chilling effect on the companies      who would want to administer these programs. I strongly urge      you to vote against H.J.Res.66 and support states' rights to      create these programs.

10024,topic-id,2990,"Mr.President, I look forward to having this discussion this afternoon about the Affordable Care Act and the many votes and actions that are going to be taking place. I especially look forward to having this discussion with the Presiding Officer because I know his State is greatly impacted by the health care delivery system and its shortfalls, and I look forward to discussing with him some of the many ideas that our colleagues have.  I will say this at the outset of my comments. I am willing to work with anybody to improve our health care delivery system. I am willing to discuss with anybody what we need to do to improve the quality of health care for Americans, and I am specifically interested in making sure that we improve the outcomes of many Americans' health care and that we also lower costs.  It has been the hallmark of what the Northwest health care delivery system has been all about. Yes, that is right. We get less money and deliver better outcomes. It is not because we all like to hike, although there are many Washingtonians who like to hike. It is because we have had to make do with less, and we have built a better system. We hope the rest of the country can move forward along similar lines.  So I am here to talk about the Affordable Care Act and the many aspects of it that are so important to our Nation in actually slowing health care costs and reducing our deficit. That is one of the cornerstones of why we did delivery system reform and why we did health care reform. We needed to slow the rate of health insurance increases, and we needed to lower the costs for us as a nation as well for the private sector. That was the task at hand. So to my colleagues who are ready to repeal all that, I ask you to wait. I ask you to stop and think about what we are doing, and before you repeal, think about what we are going to put in its place because this is such an important issue.  What does the Affordable Care Act mean? One of the aspects that I think is getting lost in this debate is that people are talking about what has happened in a percentage of the individual market. They are talking about the plans as they related to last October and what happened with rate increases. Some people said: Oh, well, a lot of providers went out and offered a lot of low-ball coverage costs and came back with higher rates later. Some people said: Some of the pools aren't big enough. Some people said: Well, the coverage we are going to guarantee is going to help. But the issue is that the Affordable Care Act is much more than just what we tried to do in the individual markets. It is about providing affordable coverage, but it is also about reducing costs, improving the health care delivery system, protecting women's health, and saving the taxpayers money. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will think about all of these issues--providing affordable coverage, reducing costs, improving the health care delivery system. I warn my colleagues that if you repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away its improvements to the delivery system, you are going to balloon the deficit, and that is something that we cannot afford.  What am I talking about when I say ``affordable coverage''? Well, let's take Washington State, for example. I am sure the Presiding Officer could take his State also, but in our State, there are 3 million Washingtonians with preexisting conditions who are guaranteed coverage; there are 50,000 young adults who can keep coverage through their parents' plans; and more than 600,000 Washingtonians have been covered by the Medicaid expansion.[[Page S129]]  To me, the Medicaid expansion is about simple math. Medicaid is expanded because it is the most cost-effective, economical way for that population to get health care coverage and to be part of the health care system, keeping our costs down and keeping that population healthy.  Depending on what State you are from and what philosophy you have as an individual, you may not be for Medicaid expansion. There have been many times that across the aisle we have been able to come to terms on Medicaid expansion and on the CHIP program because we believe that having a healthier population is a good economic policy for our After the Affordable Care Act implementation, we actually have results, studies, and analysis by various States in the Nation that have said that expanding the Medicaid population has helped our economy and has helped our States overall. So I would say to my colleagues, please do not repeal the Medicaid expansion. Please do not put these people back on the street with their health care problems and health care issues and increase the cost of uncompensated care. That is not a strategy.  What else do we want to do? We want to drop the rate of uninsured The Affordable Care Act has done that, decreasing by more than 40 percent the number of uninsured Less than 9 percent of Americans are now uninsured. In our State, the uninsured rate has dropped to 5.8 percent, which is a nearly 60-percent decrease. For us in the State of Washington, we have more people covered. The Affordable Care Act is covering more people, so we have taken more people out of the uninsured market.  The way the other side of the aisle would like to describe this is that the whole thing is falling apart because of some changes and shifts in the individual market, but the facts are there that the law is not only expanding coverage but lowering costs. Looking at what health care costs would have been over the last decade has always been a tricky issue. The rates of health care costs were going up. I like to say that we may want health care costs to keep pace with the rate of inflation--and I will give health costs a little bit of an inflationary bump because of technology and new innovation. It is not the same as the rate of inflation for everything else, but at the same time, we shouldn't be seeing double-digit increases in the costs of health care. Our goal was to change the system to the degree that we would see health care costs more in line or a little bit above the rate of inflation.  This chart shows the national expenditures for health care on the dotted line on these actual and most recent projections of what the health care system is doing now compared to what it would have been before the Affordable Care So again, people are debating over what these increases are, when in reality we were seeing double-digit increases, and now we are seeing the cost growth of health care go down.  So going back to the chart for a second, this projection is so big because of many factors. This is about changing the delivery system; this is about making sure that there are not exorbitant amounts of uncompensated care; and this is about making sure that we don't overspend on the health care delivery system. I can imagine that for some States this must be the most frustrating issue, particularly if the reimbursement rate has led to a population that is constantly underserved because no one wants to see those patients. We in the Northwest have had that frustration because we get somewhere between $1,000 to $2,000 less--maybe even more--per Medicare beneficiary than many other States in the country. That has led to a situation where people don't even see Medicare beneficiaries in parts of our That is right. People have to travel a great distance to find a doctor because they can't find one because of the Medicare reimbursement rate.  My solution is, if we are providing health care in my State with better outcomes and lower costs, I shouldn't be penalized for that; I should be rewarded. Every other State should try to practice medicine that actually helps us lower the costs.  So why are we working on this issue? The Affordable Care Act has contributed to slower cost growth. Medicare spent $473 billion less in the 5-year period from 2009-2014 compared to the benchmark--compared to what would have been done if we did nothing. So, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I know you are all for repeal. Where will you replace this money? Where are you going to come up with those savings? If you come to the floor and say that you don't want to repeal the delivery system reform that we fought so hard for and crafted, that you are willing to make those changes and keep the delivery system, we will be listening with open arms and great receptivity because there are many people on this side of the aisle who have worked very, very hard on these reforms.  In the private sector, we have also slowed the rate of growth in insurance premiums. I am talking now about the employer-based plans. We slowed the rate to one-third of what it was before.  Individuals are seeing lower increases than what they would have had to pay before these reforms.  So what is the debate about now? What we are trying to do in health care reform is improve health care by decreasing costs, having better patient outcomes, and helping doctors spend more time with their patients than with their paperwork. This is critically important because what we are seeing in the United States is doctors spending more time on the paperwork of the system than on the actual outcomes of their patients.  We want everybody to have a medical home. We want everybody to have a delivery system that rewards outcomes, and that is what we are driving for, but the debate in Washington has not been over this issue of where Americans get their insurance coverage. As you can see from this chart, 49 percent of Americans get insurance through work, 34 percent of them through Medicare and Medicaid and other public programs, and then a much smaller percentage are uninsured or in the individual market. The debate now is over the individual market. The debate is over the 7-percent number.  In some States, the individual market was out of whack for a variety of reasons. Maybe the risk pool was too small, maybe insurers went too low on their original estimates, maybe they made some changes that didn't work in that marketplace, but that doesn't mean we throw out all of the Affordable Care Act that is doing such great work just because 7 percent of the population in the individual market needs further attention. It doesn't mean that we repeal all of this. It certainly doesn't mean that we give this uncertainty to the American people about whether they are going to have health care coverage and give the illusion that the other side of the aisle is doing anything but taking the system and capping Medicare and Medicaid, giving out a check that never keeps pace with inflation, and then taking the savings from the system and channeling it into corporate tax reform relief. No, no, no, no, no. We need to make the health care delivery system work for the American people, deliver better outcomes, and continue to make reforms.  What are the innovations that we are talking about in the delivery system? Well, my colleague, the Presiding Officer, will know, because he understands health care, that the innovation in health care is about everybody having a medical home. Why do you need a medical home? You need a medical home because you need to be seen, not by the emergency room physician but by your doctor and someone who is going to understand your health care needs.  We need to make investments in primary care and prevention and wellness. I am sure the Presiding Officer understands that we don't have enough primary care providers in the United We need to change our system for the GME; that is, graduate medical education, so we can get more primary care providers.  We also need to focus on health and wellness. That is what the Affordable Care Act does. It starts to look at the system and rewards prevention and wellness. The Affordable Care Act says: OK, let's try to do this in a new way. Accountable care organizations aim for a global budget instead of all the paperwork that has to happen. A provision I authored, the Basic Health Plan, which is being used in the State of New York, is showing results in lowering[[Page S130]]the costs of premiums, giving affordability to people well beyond what they were able to otherwise get.  The other idea is rebalancing nursing care to community-based care. Twenty-one States applied for and were approved to do rebalancing. A lot of these States were Republican States in the South that took the money from the Affordable Care Act and bought into this really smart notion. It says: Let's rebalance away from nursing home care into community-based care, and we as the Federal Government will help incent that. So all the Republican Governors that took that money from the Affordable Care Act to try to rebalance their population away from a very expensive delivery system to a new delivery system, are they now going to pay us back? Is that what repeal is going to mean, that we are going to ask them to pay us the money back or that we are going to forgo this notion that moving people out of nursing homes and keeping them in their community homes is more important?  I will tell you this. We have a problem of an aging population in the United States of America, and the best thing we can do is help change the delivery system so it is more cost effective for the future. That is what the Affordable Care Act did.  The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which is also a part of the Affordable Care Act, drove in some incredible efficiencies. The Secretary just spoke today at the National Press Club, talking about focusing on better managing care for many people affected with diabetes because they are one of the biggest cost drivers. So all of this innovation is part of the Affordable Care Are we going to repeal that, too? Are we going to repeal all those health care delivery reforms that are helping reduce the cost of health care?  So what does repeal actually mean?  I am taking it from two different sources here; that is, a full Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act will increase the deficit by $350 billion over 10 years.  Why does the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that? Why do they say that? Why would they make such a claim? Because they know that built into the Affordable Care Act are changes to the health care delivery system that improve access, focus on better outcomes, and change our system for the better. We cannot afford to repeal this as a way to try to say to our base: This is a better way of delivering health care.  What does the Affordable Care Act come down to?  The philosophy we pushed through is to put the patient at the center of the health care delivery system so that it works for them. The repeal attempt by the other side is nothing more than basically saying we are going to come up with a model where you are not at the center of this, you are going to get a check that no longer pays for your full health insurance costs, you are going to get capitated and so is Medicare and Medicaid--or at least that is all we can get out of the other side right now about their plans.  It is very important to me that we do not repeal the Affordable Care Act and that we certainly don't repeal the Affordable Care Act without any idea what it is that we are going to be doing instead. We have millions of Americans who will not be covered, and we are going to throw away our whole system, which has managed to save private employers and individual families millions of dollars--I would say billions of dollars over the time period of this legislation and put us on the right track. If we have to make some changes and adjustments to the system, let's make some adjustments and changes to the system, but let's not throw out the entire legislation, and certainly let us not steal away the Affordable Care Act from the American people.  Basically, that is what repeal is. Repeal is stealing away the affordability they have been granted over these last several years and instead taking it for some other corporate interest. I hope it is not to stuff it into a tax reform bill to give relief to corporate America because that is not what we need. We need a delivery system that works for everyone. We need to save those individuals by making sure there is a cost-effective health care option for them and the marketplace, and I look forward to seeing real and serious legislation--not a poster board but a solution.  I love working with my colleagues who want to work on these ideas. I do. I will because this is a solvable problem. It is. We have shown that. We have enough results. We have to make some adjustments, but repealing is just stealing health care from hard-working I urge my colleagues to turn that down.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

9991,topic-id,902,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about an issue that is important to all of us.  We are, obviously, a nation in transition. Recently, the Senate took the first steps to repeal ObamaCare and begin a transition toward policies that will ensure continued access to health care with more affordability and flexibility for all. We need a stable transition that will empower Americans to make the best health care decisions for their families.  In my home State of West Virginia, ObamaCare has been very difficult for many. It has meant skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing copays and deductibles for families and small businesses. It has meant little, if any, choice of insurers. As a matter of fact, for the first several years, we had no choice. We now have two insurers in several counties, but in the beginning, the entire State had no choice.  It has meant fewer choices of doctors and hospitals, as networks shrink and plans become more restrictive. Now we must repair what can be fixed, scrap what is not working, and create a better health care reality for all  I have spoken with small business owners who have absorbed the cost of increased insurance, but their employees are getting less coverage. I have spoken to families who may have health insurance, but due to the high deductibles and copays, they don't use it. They can't afford to even go. I have also heard from those in my State who have real concerns about what this transition will mean to them. This is especially true for those who receive coverage through  My State is one of the States that did an expanded For all of these West Virginians--and there are somewhere around 177,000 new folks who are on Medicaid--whether they are the Medicaid recipients or the business owners and families who are currently struggling, we need to have health insurance that works for everybody.  So I want them to know--and many of them have called my office, and I have talked with them a lot in our State--that I am listening to their concerns. As we move forward, I am working to balance each of these needs and ensure access in West Virginia and across the Nation to affordable, quality health care.  To achieve this goal, I am joining Senators Cassidy, Collins, and Isakson to introduce an alternative to ObamaCare which was introduced yesterday. It is called the Patient Freedom It sounds good. We are really good at making names that sound good, but the Patient Freedom Act lives up to its name.  The Patient Freedom Act of 2017 removes ObamaCare's most burdensome regulations. It provides our States, which are closest to the people who are accessing health care, the opportunity and funding to ensure that those currently covered by Medicaid expansion are protected and retain their health coverage. It returns authority to the States and provides more health care choices and better insurance options to individuals and families. It keeps important consumer protections, such as coverage for preexisting conditions, and extends coverage to children and dependents until the age of 26--both very popular parts of the It protects the Federal black lung benefits program, which is especially important in my State of West Virginia and the surrounding areas.  In addition to all of those important changes, it gives States a pathway forward for replacing Specifically, following repeal, which we know we are going to do, States will have three options. First, a State, if it so chooses, could choose to reinstate ObamaCare, or a State could go without Federal assistance and opt to not receive any Federal funding for tax credits or Medicaid expansion. Finally, a State could choose an innovative replacement plan where the State determines its own insurance regulations. In this scenario, the State would be eligible for 95 percent of the funds it would receive under ObamaCare, and the Medicaid expansion would be fully funded. For a State like West Virginia that has already expanded Medicaid, the State could either keep its Medicaid expansion as is, or they could convert it to subsidies to help individuals purchase the private insurance.  Under this plan, individuals would use a Roth Health Savings Account to purchase health care. This would enable uninsured individuals to purchase health insurance that meets their specific needs. States would have the option to auto-enroll uninsured individuals into a standard health care plan, with individuals able to easily opt out if they didn't want it. Auto enrollment would ensure stability and soundness to our insurance markets.  The Patient Freedom Act is a smart, innovative way forward and meets the varied needs of people in my State of West Virginia and across the country. The legislation reflects Senator Cassidy's experience as a physician, and I thank him for his innovation--he has worked with patients who are uninsured--and I appreciate his leadership so much, as I do Senator Collins in particular and Senator Isakson as another cosponsor. As other replacement plans are drafted and introduced in the Senate, I will evaluate those proposals to ensure they meet West Virginians' health care needs. I am committed to replacing ObamaCare with a system that offers us more choice. We can figure this out; we know what we need--lowers cost gives patients and families more control--because, together, we can achieve a health care system that works for everybody.

They keep a record of where you go. They keep a record of whether you wore your seatbelt. They keep a record of whether you applied the brakes or turned the turn signal on. That is your automobile. You don't have to drive.  Just recently, in the last couple months, we have learned that our televisions and children's dolls are doing the same thing. Last month, it was revealed that Vizio had spied on 11 million consumers by listening to them while their TV was off because they can do it.  Also, last month, a child's doll called My Friend Cayla for little girls or boys was banned in Germany--banned in Germany--because that doll listens and responds. It goes into the internet, and the doll's owner keeps and sells that information.

9999,topic-id,1143,"Mr.President, in December 2015, this body came together to enact what then-President Obama called a Christmas miracle, the Every Student Succeeds Act, This truly bipartisan, bicameral compromise reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, for the first time in more than 14 years on the compromise of local control for Federal safeguards. First enacted more than 50 years ago as a part of the civil rights era, the ESEA sought to ensure that all children, regardless of their ZIP Code, were able to obtain a high-quality education. The legislative process is about compromise, and I have[[Page S1804]]concerns that last Thursday's vote to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the Department of Education's ESSA regulations will roll back that compromise and leave our neediest students without the Federal safeguards they deserve.  Ensuring access to a high-quality education is one of the most important duties of Federal, State, and local governments. I supported ESSA, along with 84 other Members of this body, to move our State and local school systems away from a Federal, one-size-fits-all ``adequate yearly progress'' accountability system and allow States to design their own accountability systems to identify, monitor, and assist schools. Rather than rely on a collective set of test scores to measure student performance as under No Child Left Behind, ESSA allows States to design accountability systems that will take into consideration student growth over the course of a school year. States will be able to consider multiple measures of student learning, including access to academic resources, school climate, and safety, access to support personnel, and other measures which can allow for differentiations in student performance within a school or a local school district. All of this is being done while ensuring students are held to the high, yet achievable, standard of being college- and career-ready upon completion of high school. While State and local school systems have newfound flexibility under ESSA, they must adhere to a Federal civil rights safeguards meant to ensure children with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and our English language learners are not forgotten.  Just as the Bush administration led Department of Education provided after the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, the Obama administration led Department of Education worked to enact regulations and provide States with guidance and technical assistance to properly implement After work for nearly a year and feedback from more than 20,000 education stakeholders, the Department published its final accountability, State plans, and reporting regulations in November 2016. The regulations provided broad flexibility for State and local school systems to improve student outcomes in their States and districts while ensuring all students receive an excellent and well-rounded education. The regulations provided certainty to States and local school systems and clarified how to comply with their statutory requirements.  The Congressional Review Act was the wrong instrument to modify the Department's accountability regulations. In 2006 and 2008, the Bush administration led Department of Education responded to concerns regarding the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act by education stakeholders and updated the regulations and guidance necessary for State and local school systems to adhere to the law. Now that the Congressional Review Act has struck down the existing regulations, the Department is prohibited from issuing similar regulations or addressing future implementation concerns raised by those same stakeholders. Just as we have worked to move away from the one-size-fits-all Federal solutions under the No Child Left Behind Act, the Congressional Review Act wrongly utilizes a one-cleaver-eliminates-all approach. We could not pick and choose which parts of the regulations we would have wanted to keep, such as the regulation's additional year for States to implement their State-designed accountability systems before taking corrective action, all aspects of the regulation, and nearly a year's worth of the Department's work is eliminated. School systems will now have to rely on nonlegally binding guidance from the Department on how to adhere to their statutory requirements.  In my home State, the Maryland State Department of Education has worked for more than a year to develop our State's education plan as required under Our State superintendent of schools, Karen Salmon, has traversed the State, listening and engaging with Marylanders who seek to have a voice in their child's education. The purpose of ESSA was to ensure that we return the ability of our State and local school systems to provide for the education of our children in exchange for staying within certain Federal safeguards for our neediest students. This is what we are doing in The concerns and feedback expressed by Marylanders will be incorporated into a revised State plan and submitted to the Department of Education later this year. All of this work to comply with the Department's draft and final ESSA regulations, all of the consultation with members of the local community, is now for naught now that the Senate agreed to the use of the Our State and States are left with uncertainty as to how to comply with their statutory Federal requirements. Our States are clamoring to move away from the uncertainty of the Department's No Child Left Behind waivers from 2012 and have a clear understanding of how to comply with Federal law. The elimination of the Department's accountability regulations further delays the ability of State and local school systems to move away from No Child Left Behind policies.  Throughout Secretary DeVos's confirmation hearing, the Secretary repeatedly demonstrated a lack of depth in the longstanding debates surrounding the education community. I have concerns that Secretary DeVos, who did not understand the protections afforded to children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, would be a forceful advocate to require States and local school systems to ensure that children with disabilities are counted and not forgotten. Given Secretary DeVos's expressed support for the privatization of our Nation's public schools and resistance to meaningful Federal oversight of nontraditional schools, I have concerns that any new regulations created by the Department could incentivize States and local school systems to promote the privatization of low-performing public schools or set different accountability standards between public schools and nontraditional schools. These concerns are not unfounded; Secretary DeVos has already informed States that the Department will be creating a new template for submitting State plans outside of what is required under the Department's existing accountability regulations. Our students need a Secretary of Education that will uphold Congress's ESSA compromise, local control for Federal safeguards.  The use of the CRA to repeal the Department's ESSA accountability regulations provides Secretary DeVos with the ability to significantly undermine the bipartisan nature of ESSA and Federal safeguards necessary to protect our students. I am disappointed a majority of my colleagues voted in favor of this shortsighted measure that fails to protect our children with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and our English language learners.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1803-2.txt,,WELCOMING BRUCE BAILLIE TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS,2017.0,14.0,March
10072,topic-id,1324,"Mr.President, I oppose the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney to serve as Director of the Office of Management & Budget, Representative Mulvaney's radical views regarding the fundamental role of government in our society make him philosophically ill-suited to run I will list a number of those views.  Social Security--In May 2009, Representative Mulvaney was a member of the South Carolina State Senate and voted to declare that Social Security is unconstitutional. He also wants to raise the retirement age to 70. Raising the retirement age to 70 would cut earned benefits by nearly 20 percent for all beneficiaries. With all the challenges people have saving for retirement, the last thing we should do is raise the Social Security retirement age.  Medicare--Representative Mulvaney is on record advocating enormous cuts to Medicare and is a proponent of Speaker Ryan's preferred ``premium support,'' i.e., voucher, concept for ``Premium support'' is a euphemism for privatizing Representative Mulvaney said on Fox News, in April, 2011. ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' And he indicated that he wants to raise the eligibility age to 67.  Medicare guarantees comprehensive health insurance coverage for almost 50 million Only 2 percent of elderly Americans are uninsured; nearly 50 percent were before Medicare was signed into law.  Debt ceiling--Representative Mulvaney appears willing to jeopardize the full faith and credit of the U.He claims that breeching the debt ceiling would not automatically trigger a default on Treasury debt; he calls such concern ``a fabricated crisis.'' Representative Mulvaney believes the Treasury would be able to ``prioritize'' payments and avoid a default.  His ``pay China first'' policy is contrary to the opinion of several recent Treasury Secretaries, would be impossible to execute from a logistical standpoint, and is based on a 1985 Government Accountability Office report the agency has since walked away from. The Treasury Department lacks legal authority to establish ``priorities'' with respect to paying the Nation's obligations. Each law obligating funds and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing, so the Department has to make payments on obligations as they come due.  Debt limit brinksmanship is expensive. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the 10-year cost to taxpayers of the 2011 debt limit standoff was $18.9 billion because of the increased interest rates on U.securities issued in 2011. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the long-term credit rating of the U.government for the first time in history, from AAA to AA+.  Government shutdowns--Representative Mulvaney believes that shutting[[Page S1228]]down the Federal Government is an acceptable way to do business. He stated on CNN that shutting down the government over funding the Affordable Care Act was ``worth it'' in October 2013 and embraces the term ``shutdown caucus.'' In a September 2015 Atlantic article, he argued that shutting down the government is important becauset it is what ``the base of the (Republican) party wants.''  Standard & Poor's determined that the October 2013 government shutdown cost $24 billion.  Federal workers--Representative Mulvaney has sponsored numerous bills attacking the Federal workforce, including many that freeze Federal workers' pay. Federal workers have already ``contributed'' over $180 billion to deficit reduction through pay freezes and other measures. He has sponsored the Federal Workforce Reduction Through Attrition Act, the most recent version of which caps the Federal workforce at 90 percent of its current level. A previous version would have mandated that ``agencies do not appoint'' for 3 years ``more than one employee for every three employees retiring or otherwise separating from government service.''  Women's reproductive health--in September 2015, Representative Mulvaney spearheaded a letter signed by 38 House Republicans--all men--opposing any legislation to fund the government that also continues to fund Planned In an August 2015 email to the Washington Post, Representative Mulvaney wrote that, if the Congress were to shut down the Federal Government over Planned Parenthood funding, ``so be it.''  Science and climate change--in a Facebook post from last September, quoted in Vox, Representative Mulvaney questioned the need for government funded research ``at all'' in the context of doubting the scientific consensus that the Zika virus causes microcephaly.  Representative Mulvaney disputes the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. During the Budget Committee's nomination hearing, when Senator Kaine asked Representative Mulvaney about human-caused climate change, Representative Mulvaney replied, ``I challenge the premise of your fact.''  The Union of Concerned Scientists opposes Representative Mulvaney's nomination, writing:       He has backed legislation to change the regulatory process      in ways that would give an even stronger influence to      industry, increase political interference and undermine      science-based decision-making .  .  . Too often, the voices      of people who will be hurt the most by rolling back science-     based safeguards are drowned out by industries. The next OMB      director needs to enact science-based laws in a timely      manner, with a focus on ensuring benefits for all  Not surprisingly, Koch Industries has been a primary donor to Representative Mulvaney's campaigns and his  Regulations--Representative Mulvaney's voting record has been hostile to regulatory efforts to improve health, safety, and consumer protections. This is especially alarming because as OMB Director, Representative Mulvaney will oversee the Office of Information and Regulatory Representative Mulvaney has voted to curtail regulations regarding debit cards, medical devices, public swimming pools, excessive executive compensation, consumer financial protection, energy exploration, investment advisers, mortgage lenders, and so on.  House Republican budget plans--the last time House Republicans brought a full budget resolution to the House floor, Representative Mulvaney voted against it because it wasn't extreme enough. He supported the Republican Study Committee, RSC, budget instead. Provisions of the most recent version of the RSC budget include: 1, a 10-year $261 billion cut to Social Security by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, COLAs, increasing the retirement age to 70, and ``increasing means-testing''; 2, $662 billion in cuts to Medicare by changing the program into a ``premium support'' model, i.e., ``voucher-izing,'' increasing the eligibility age, and phasing in means-testing; 3, $1.6 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which would be combined into one block grant program; 4, $925 billion in savings by repealing the Affordable Care Act exchanges; and 5, $2.2 trillion in cuts to undefined ``other mandatory'' spending. Notably, the budget would not raise one dime in new revenue from the Nation's wealthiest individuals and largest corporations.  ``Nannygate''--Representative Mulvaney failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 to 2004. Representative Mulvaney admitted that the nanny in question worked full time--40 hours a week--for 4 to 5 years.  Representative Mulvaney said that he didn't believe he owed payroll and unemployment insurance taxes on his nanny because ``she simply helped [my wife] with the children. We considered her a babysitter.'' This is despite the fact that, as the owner of several small businesses, he knew to pay these taxes for his other full-time employees.  As a State Senator in South Carolina, Representative Mulvaney sponsored the following three bills: 1, to prohibit candidates from the ballot for the State legislature if they had not paid all Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years; 2, to prohibit candidates from the ballot for State office if they had not paid all Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years; and 3, to prohibit the governor from appointing anyone who had not paid all Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years.  Representative Mulvaney voted for H.1563, Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015, which authorizes ``the head of an agency to take personnel actions against an agency employee who willfully failed to file a required tax return or willfully understated federal tax liability.'' It is worth noting here that Federal workers have a lower percentage of tax noncompliance than the general public--a 3.1 percent delinquency rate versus 8.7 percent. And Representative Mulvaney sponsored the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, which would have made people with ``seriously delinquent tax debts'' ineligible for Federal employment.  Representative Mulvaney is the wrong choice to run the OMB,  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1226-3.txt,,1730,2017.0,16.0,February
10025,topic-id,2656,"Madam President, I rise to address a very important issue in regard to the health care of our poorest Americans and discus my plan, the Medicaid Accountability and Care Act, or the MAC Act, which is also included in my ObamaCare replacement plan which would address the failings of our current Medicaid system. My colleague from Washington just extolled the virtues of As she pointed out, Medicaid clearly is a major part of the ObamaCare kind of response so it is apropos I would follow.  I wish to first tell you my perspective. I am a physician, and I had been working in a hospital for the uninsured for 25 to 30 years, until they blew it up. I saw prisoners, the uninsured, and Medicaid patients. You might say: Wait a second. Medicaid, it is insurance. Why would somebody with Medicaid insurance be seen at a hospital for the uninsured?  It is because in my State, like in most others, Medicaid pays beneath the physician's cost of seeing a patient. To paraphrase Saint Paul, it is the illusion of coverage without the power of access.  I will point out, the week ObamaCare passed, there was an article in the New York Times, written by a very respected journalist, Robert Pear, tracking a Medicaid patient in The physician, the oncologist seeing her, had so many Medicaid patients, the oncologist was going bankrupt because she could not afford to pay her bills so she had to discharge the Medicaid patients from her practice.  I followed up to find out what would happen, and 2 weeks after being discharged from this oncologist's practice, the patient died. This is Medicaid, which is so critical to the purported success of  Is it that we are not spending enough money; that maybe if we just spent a little bit more on Medicaid it would all be better.  A study from MIT found that 60 percent--let me stop. The State of Oregon did an expansion of Medicaid so researchers from MIT and elsewhere went to study it. This study found that 60 percent of the dollars used for the Oregon Medicaid expansion went to institutions, not for patients--as little as, say, 20 percent to 40 percent--but as little as 20 percent of the money that was put toward the Medicaid Program actually was a benefit for the patient. Let me repeat this. As much as 60 percent went to benefit institutions, not patients. They also found that patients on Medicaid did not have improved outcomes. Think about this. We are giving everybody all of this coverage. It is supposedly wonderful. Yet when they went back 1 year later and 2 years and 3 years later and looked at the patients covered on Medicaid--versus those who were not, those who continued to be uninsured--there were no better health outcomes among those who are on  If we can't agree this is a program to reform, it is going to be hard to agree on anything.  For those who are not familiar with Medicaid, let's talk a little bit about the program. Medicaid is a Federal-State program. The Federal Government provides a certain percentage--a different percentage for each State--but the State actually administers the program. In some States, the Federal Government pays 50 percent of the cost. It can go up as much as 75 percent of the cost. In Mississippi, they put up $25, they get $75. In a State such as New York, they would put up $50 and get back $50 so it is a 1-to-1.  This open-ended financing structure is based solely on how much the State spends. I will agree with my colleague from Washington We should not reward States that spend incontinently. We should not reward States that just spend, but under Medicaid, the State is rewarded. The more it[[Page S131]]spends, the more it draws down from the Federal  I always smile when people speak about the economic development of Medicaid expansion. Medicaid expansion is not about economic development. It should be about taking care of patients, but I understand that perspective because they pull down at least $1 for every dollar the State spends, sometimes at the 75-percent ratio. Under the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion, States have been drawing down 100 percent of what they spend. If the State is going to draw down 100 percent of what it spends on the Medicaid expansion population--surprise, surprise--they are actually spending at a higher rate on the expansion population than on those Medicaid patients for whom the State actually has to cover part of the cost.  The Federal Government has very little ability to weed out the corruption of the inefficient programs. Again, this matching incentive disincentivizes States from looking for ways to be more efficient, but, still, States have to balance their budget every year and Medicaid is either the second largest or largest budget item in every Even though the Federal Government is paying 50 percent to 75 percent of the traditional Medicaid population and 100 percent of the expansion population, the State taxpayer is still on the hook for a lot. On average, States spend 17 cents of every State dollar on My State of Louisiana has the highest percentage. Nineteen percent of our budget goes to The percentage is steadily increasing, nearly doubling since 2000. Sooner or later, even though the Federal Government covers the majority of the cost, the budget crunch gets more difficult because the rate of Medicaid spending is climbing faster than the State tax base.  Because of all the Federal requirements on what a State can change in the Medicaid Programs, in order to come up with the State match, States have two options. They can pay providers less or they can cut other programs such as education and move the money to the Medicaid  First, paying physicians less brings us back to the situation Robert Pear described in his New York Times article, where the oncologist was going bankrupt because she could not afford to see more Medicaid patients.  Let's speak a little bit about education. I am just going to use my hands. In 1963, the State government used about that much for education and when Medicaid started in 1964 or 1965, about that much for In 2009, for the first time ever, on average, States spent more on Medicaid than on education. Now the percentage on Medicaid continues to climb, if you will, cannibalizing the State dollars that could be used to support higher education, primary and secondary education.  Let's look at the effect of the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion. Let's look not at my own State but Kentucky, a State which has been at this for a little bit longer. The previous Governor, Governor Beshear, implemented the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion---just kind of traditional Medicaid--and expanded it.  Again, my colleague from Washington State was extolling how much ObamaCare has lowered costs. When Kentucky originally implemented it, they expected the long-term cost of Medicaid expansion to be only a 4-percent increase in their current State spending on After only 1 year of the expansion, updated projections showed the expansion cost the Federal Government more than half a billion dollars more than Governor Beshear had projected for 2014, and this will double in the coming years, meaning that the Medicaid expansion will cost $1 billion more per year than expected. Again, this was the projected cost. This is the actual cost.  If this is saving money--oh, my gosh. What would happen if we actually lost money? By anybody's calculation, this is losing money. This has been the situation across the country. States that have expanded Medicaid have turned out to be far more expensive for the Federal taxpayer than originally anticipated. Again, it just isn't a Federal program. Like many other States across the Nation, Kentucky is facing serious fiscal issues. They do not have $1 billion lying around.  On its current path, Kentucky's own projections suggest the State will start losing $45 million in perpetuity beginning in 2021. This is a 10-percent increase. The Federal Government is putting up most, but Kentucky itself will have to put up an extra $45 million per year.  Also, given that the Federal taxpayer--you and me, us, the people watching on TV and in the Gallery--given that we, the Federal taxpayer, put up 90 percent of Kentucky's costs--well, every State's costs, we just happen to be speaking about Kentucky--but every State's costs are 90 percent of the costs in perpetuity. As this cost grows, taxpayers are on the hook for 90 percent of it. Such a deal.  It doesn't have to be this way. Let me compliment When Vice President-Elect Mike Pence was Governor of Indiana, rather than adopting kind of ObamaCare's let's do the traditional Medicaid and watch the cost explosion--he took an innovative approach and created the Healthy Indiana Plan or HIP as an alternative to simply doling out the dollars. The plan gave each beneficiary a high-deductible plan in combination with a health savings account. It was capitated. Again, my colleague from Washington who just spoke kind of criticized these capitated plans, which means there is a set amount, and the person is, if you will, engaged in managing her dollars.  The State will put up a certain amount on a sliding scale based upon the income of the Hoosier who enrolled. The plan empowered low-income enrollees to become better consumers of health care. Hoosiers who participated--for those not from Indiana, I have learned you don't say Indianans, you say So Hoosiers who participated changed behaviors. They use 40-percent less charity care than traditional Medicaid patients. Seventy percent contributed to their own Once they started contributing, virtually all continued to do so regularly. That is despite 83 percent of those participants in the Healthy Indiana Plan earning less than the Federal poverty level. Those Healthy Indiana Plan patients also saw clear improvements in care over traditional They decreased their emergency room utilization by 40 percent relative to Medicaid's average. Thousands more physicians chose to take Medicaid patients. Remember, at the beginning, I discussed how physicians often can't see Medicaid patients. It pays them below the cost of their seeing patients. In Indiana, thousands more chose to take Medicaid patients, improving access to quality care. Clearly, the Healthy Indiana Plan was able to work for Indiana patients. This is the sort of quality innovation that States can devise if we give them the power.  Now, revising the current funding structure would also encourage States to follow Indiana's example and develop innovative Medicaid programs to increase the efficiency in which the program spends money. Again, that is Federal taxpayer money. That is our money. For those watching right now, it is our money. We want to encourage States to be efficient with how they spend it. There should be greater flexibility to design the Medicaid program to better meet the needs of State residents. States will be given the latitude and the freedom to develop various coverage options and specialized delivery systems for different Medicaid patient populations.  This is why I developed the Medicaid Accountability and Care Act, which we call the MAC It reforms the flawed financing of Medicaid by giving each State a set amount according to how many people each State has enrolled in the different categories that each State's Medicaid program treats. That is a mouthful, but it is basically exactly like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or like any employer who goes to an insurance company and says: I want to give you a set amount of money per employee who enrolls in your plan. For that matter, it is like Medicaid managed care, where the State will go to a managed care company and give the managed care company a set amount per enrollee in that plan.  Now, I hear people say: Oh, my gosh, it is a set amount. That is all we do in health care, except in Medicaid, where we reward inefficient spending. So if it is good enough for the State to do it to the Medicaid managed care program, why isn't it good enough for the Federal taxpayers to do it to the State? I[[Page S132]]am not quite sure I understand the critics of this approach.  But, again, under the Medicaid Accountability and Care Act, or the MAC Act, each State would tell the Federal Government how many beneficiaries it has in different categories of Medicaid and the Federal Government would give each State the amount of money appropriate for that number of enrollees in each category. The advantage of this is it is a set amount. It allows the Federal Government to do that, which it does not do now; and that is, to say to the State government: If you recover fraud, you can keep that money.  Now, let's go back. Under the current situation, the Federal taxpayer pays 50 to 75 percent of the State's Medicaid costs. If there is fraud--and there is lots of fraud in Medicaid--and the State government recovers it, it has to give back to the Federal taxpayers whatever the percent was the Federal Government put up. So if the State goes out and recovers $1 million--spends money on the attorneys, spends money on the investigation, on the court case, and it recovers $1 million--it has to give half a million to $750 million back to the Federal taxpayers. It is responsible for the prosecution, the investigation, but it gives most of the money back to the So the States don't investigate because it is a disincentive to go after fraud.  Under the MAC Act, if the State goes out and gets $1 million worth of fraud, the State keeps the money. That is good for the It encourages the State to root out that fraud and to keep the money and to make sure that fly-by-night scam artists never get to become Medicaid providers in the first place.  The MAC Act's reforms will result in improved health care for Medicaid patients.  I will go back to where I started.  I am a physician who worked in a hospital for the uninsured and Medicaid patients. These are my patients. If this proposal was not about improving patient care, I would not advance it. But recall that Oregon, with their Medicaid program, upon review by MIT, found no improvement in patient outcomes. Then let's go to Indiana, which actually set up health savings accounts and engaged the patient in managing their own health, and there, we do see better outcomes. We should all be about patients having better outcomes.  Along the way, we do other things, such as equalizing the amount of money the Federal Government gives to each State per beneficiary. Again, my colleague from Washington State pointed out that folks in Washington get less money from the Federal Government than do other I would attempt to equalize that with the MAC  So let me finish. The American people have been voting against ObamaCare for the last 8 years. Whatever its proponents may say, the American people have found it wanting. One aspect of it that has been wanting is We have a proposal before us based upon my experience of treating patients in the hospital for the uninsured and Medicaid but also taking States like Indiana and elsewhere in which we attempt to give States the initiative to create specialized programs that focus on patient-centered care. In that way, we will see better outcomes. The current Medicaid funding system under ObamaCare works against States, penalizing them for addressing fraud, abuse, and waste. This must change. We need to change this broken framework with a system that will work with States to get their Medicaid programs back on track, benefiting their patients as much as possible.  With that, I yield the floor.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

9794,topic-id,791,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1667, the ``Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017.''  In 2008, the United States economy nearly collapsed as a direct result of lending practices in the housing market that were predatory, unsafe, and in many cases fraudulent.  Investments in toxic securities created a cycle of failure in the housing market: the declining health of the market undermined the value of these securities, which, in turn, devastated the housing market and caused the failure of several of the nation's largest financial institutions.  With the financial system in near collapse, large financial institutions were essentially able to ``blackmail'' the government because these banks were so large that there was no way to break them apart, as then-FDIC Chair Sheila Bair testified in 2009.  Although the true hardship caused by this widespread fraud is incalculable, we do know that it erased $10 trillion of household wealth and caused 8 million Americans to lose their jobs and 5 million Americans to lose their homes.  Rhode Island, my home state, was hit particularly hard by the recession. When I took office, the unemployment rate in Rhode Island hovered at 11.2%, the fifth highest in the country.  In the wake of this economic disaster, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to comprehensively reform the financial system.  Because of this law--which includes some of the strongest consumer protections passed since the Great Depression--the banking system is stronger; there is more transparency in consumer lending; and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) continues to serve as an important watchdog to protect Americans against predatory lending and fraud in the financial system.  Title I of Dodd-Frank provides stability in markets by requiring large financial institutions to have a ``living will'' to serve as a plan for the ``rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.''  Title II ends taxpayer bailouts of banks that are too big to fail by providing financial regulators with orderly liquidation authority where a bank's collapse ``would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States'' and ``no viable private sector alternative is available.'' This process expressly requires a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury that the bankruptcy process would not be appropriate to resolve a distressed firm.  Leading commentators agree, however, that the U.bankruptcy process is not designed to accommodate the orderly resolution of a large financial institution that poses systemic risk to the entire economy.  H.1667, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act,'' addresses this concern by establishing a ``single point of entry'' for the resolution of an insolvent financial institution with assets exceeding $50 billion. The goal of the bill is to establish a process where a distressed financial institution could voluntarily seek bankruptcy relief while its subsidiaries continue to operate.  But while I support H.1667 and am an original cosponsor of this bill, make no mistake: I will strongly oppose any effort to combine this measure with a repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act, or any part of this law for that matter.  Since this law was enacted, the economic recovery has led to the creation of more than 15 million private sector jobs, a 60% increase in business lending, and record performance by the Dow Jones Industrial  It is critical that we build on this progress through education, training, and other initiatives to promote economic opportunity. Too many Americans are still unemployed or working two or even three jobs just to get by while Wall Street has never been better.  We must also preserve and advance the protections established by the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure transparency and stability in the financial system while protecting consumers.  The National Bankruptcy Conference agrees with this assessment, and has previously instructed that the Dodd-Frank Act should ``continue to be available even if the Bankruptcy Code is amended to better address the resolution of SIFIs because the ability of U.regulators to assume full control of the resolution process to elicit the cooperation from non-U.regulators is an essential insurance policy against systemic risk and potential conflict and dysfunction among the multinational components of SIFIs.''  Moreover, should this legislation become law, Dodd-Frank provides a valuable backstop to bankruptcy through its Orderly Liquidation Authority, which empowers the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to act as a receiver for large financial institutions that are ``too big to fail.''  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Jenkins of West Virginia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Goodlatte) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.1667, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2715-2.txt,2055,HONORING THE 23RD ANNUAL VERA HOUSE WHITE RIBBON CAMPAIGN,2017.0,5.0,January
9963,topic-id,292,"Mr.President, I rise in support of H.40, a resolution of disapproval of the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to the implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. The rule in question would require the Social Security Administration to send to the Attorney General the names of certain beneficiaries for inclusion in the NICS background check database and would make it illegal for these beneficiaries to own or possess a firearm.  In matters where the government is promulgating regulations limiting the Constitutional rights of Americans, it is especially important that the regulations be drafted carefully. I am concerned that this rule targets individuals with mental illness without requiring the Social Security Administration to determine that the individuals whose rights are being limited are dangerous either to themselves or others. As a result, this rule inadvertently reinforces an unfortunate and inaccurate stereotype that suggests that most individuals with mental illness are violent.  Rather than focus on whether the beneficiary presents a danger, the rule instead turns on beneficiaries' ability to manage their finances. Because of this, the rule includes a test that could lead to absurd and unfair results. Under the rule, two individuals could present the exact same condition and symptoms, but if one of them required assistance with their financial affairs, that person would be reported to the NICS background check system, while the other would not.  I hope that the Social Security Administration will consider these suggestions as well as the comments from my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, and others, and promulgate a new rule. Addressing these concerns would result in a more effective rule, consistent with Constitutional requirements, which would make Americans safer while protecting the rights of those living with mental illness.

10027,topic-id,1595,"Madam President, as my colleagues know, this week we will take up the nominations of the men and women who President-Elect Trump has selected for his I have to say, for myself, that looking at the quality of the people the President-elect has nominated gives me quite a bit of reassurance about what his administration will be like, starting with the Vice President, Mike Mr.Pence is somebody well known to those of us here in the Congress, having served 12 years in the House of Representatives, and then he went on to be the Governor of Indiana for 4 years. He is eminently qualified to help the administration and the President-elect navigate the perils and pitfalls of the legislative process here in the Senate and in the  Then we look at the other people who have been nominated, whether it is for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, or the Department of Homeland In some cases, they are unconventional choices, but, in every case I can think of, they are people who have eminent qualifications to offer to the administration and to the country in this new administration.  This is one of the most important responsibilities a Senator has--to make sure we conduct the advice and consent process and make sure we vet the nominees for these important posts. But in one case in particular, it is not going to be all that hard because we have served alongside Senator Jeff Sessions, for 15 years in my case and for 20 years in other cases.  We should be working together, as President Obama himself has said, recognizing the importance of a smooth transition from the outgoing administration to the new one. That should be true no matter what side of the aisle you are on. Unfortunately, I think some of our Democratic friends are still in some shock from the election on November 8.  I remember a book written on the grieving process, describing that first comes denial, then comes anger, and then ultimately acceptance. I think what our Democratic colleagues have to work through is their denial and anger to get to acceptance of the fact that President-Elect Trump and Vice President-Elect Pence won the election.  So what is our responsibility? It is to work in a bipartisan basis to make sure that they have the people around them that they need in order to run the government.  We are simply trying to stick to the same standard set under President In 2009, our Democratic colleagues held seven confirmation hearings in one day. That is more than we are planning to do on So my response to our friends across the aisle is to listen to the junior Senator from Connecticut, who told a reporter: ``I can figure out how to walk across the hall and attend two hearings occurring simultaneously.''  One of the most important hearings, in my mind, we will hold is the hearing we are going to have in the Judiciary Committee starting tomorrow on the President-elect's nominee as Attorney General--our friend Senator Jeff As I said, the junior Senator from Alabama has a lengthy history serving his State and country in law enforcement, but his passion for public service started long before that.  Before we knew him in the Senate, Jeff Sessions was an Eagle Scout from Hybart, He later served in the Army After college, he taught at Goode Street Elementary School in Montgomery, I bet even those of us who have known him a long time did not know that he taught at Goode Street Elementary School in Montgomery, AL, after college. Then he went on to become a lawyer, receiving his law degree from the University of He later worked as a Federal prosecutor, including 12 years as a U.attorney for the Southern District of Then--where I got to know him--he became his State's attorney general.  Senator Sessions' record is one of a person not afraid to go after those who are abusing power. From State judges and senators to county commissioners and school board members, Jeff Sessions has rooted out and punished corrupt officials as was his job as a U.attorney. As U.attorney, he fought to secure the rights of African Americans to vote and successfully advocated to uphold the death penalty sentence of Ku Klux Klan member and murderer Henry  Here in the Senate, he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for 20[[Page S133]]years, where I have come to know him well. Working with him has shown me not only his sharp mind but his passion for the people of this country and his commitment to the rule of law. He is a hard worker and a person who makes his decisions based on what he thinks is the right thing to do and his own integrity. I know many of us can attest to this, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. While holding true to his principles, Jeff Sessions has found common ground with folks across the ideological spectrum on many issues, including ones he will work on as Attorney General of the United  For example, in 2003, Senator Sessions worked closely with the late-Senator Teddy Kennedy, whom I have called the liberal lion of the Perhaps, I am not the first one, but he certainly was that. He was a larger-than-life personality and somebody who personified our political opposition across the aisle. But Jeff Sessions and Teddy Kennedy worked together to help fight sexual assault in prison in a way that was both proactive and pragmatic. Senator Sessions crafted legislation to encourage State governments to take affirmative measures that reduced the frequency of sexual assault in jails and prisons. We continue to see the benefits of this legislation today, as more and more States get serious and crack down on this crime. Last Congress, I was proud to work with Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, the ranking member in the 114th Congress, and others in this Chamber, to pass the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which created additional tools that strengthened the Prison Rape Elimination  Then there is the work Senator Sessions has done with the assistant minority leader, the Democratic whip, and the senior Senator from Vermont, two of this Chamber's more liberal Members, to address sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. It became obvious over time that many people living in our inner cities were using crack cocaine, but their fellow countrymen living in more affluent areas caught with powder cocaine were subject to far lesser sentences than those in the inner cities using crack cocaine. The work Senator Sessions did with Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy, called the Fair Sentencing Act, was signed in to law by President Obama in 2010. Senator Sessions saw the harsh penalties many young African-American men experienced for possession of crack, compared to the lighter punishments given to suspects found with powder cocaine, who as a group tended to be more White or To me, this is the sort of thing that offends the most basic sensibilities of Jeff Sessions--somebody who believes unequivocally in color-blind justice and equal justice under the law. Of course, the utmost responsibility of the U.Department of Justice is to enforce the law and ensure equality for all Americans under our  Senator Sessions has demonstrated that he is qualified and prepared to serve as the Nation's top law enforcement officer--not only thanks to a proven track record but, because at his core, he understands the importance of justice for all and upholding the rule of law. Now, you don't have to take my word for it. Here is what some of our leading Democratic colleagues have had to say about working with Senator Sessions over the years:  The incoming Democratic leader, Senator Schumer of New York, called Jeff Sessions ``straightforward and fair.''  Senator Durbin, the Democratic whip, in June 2010, working with him to eliminate the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine called Jeff Sessions ``a man of his word.''  Then, perhaps, there is an unlikely person to compliment Senator Sessions, because of some of the positions Attorney General Holder took that I think Senator Sessions found objectionable--particularly when injecting too much politics into the work of the Department of Justice and not enforcing what Senator Sessions saw to be the rule of law. Nevertheless, former Attorney General Eric Holder on January 2016, 2009, called Senator Sessions ``a great U.attorney.''  Senator Sessions has both the temperament and experience to restore the faith of all Americans in our justice system, and we have the responsibility to grant him a fair confirmation hearing starting tomorrow. I suspect our Democratic colleagues agree, because in 2015 they penned a letter that said:       The Attorney General plays a pivotal role in administering      our nation's laws and protecting our national security. This      is why the Senate, regardless of the party in control, has      historically given swift consideration to Attorney General      nominees.  Those were our Democratic colleagues. The chance to do so is right before all of us, and I hope they will assist us in a fair and swift confirmation process for a truly honorable and deserving candidate for Attorney  I know we will miss Senator Sessions in the Not that we always agreed with him, but he always disagreed in the most congenial sort of manner and in a way that we knew he had respect for people of widely divergent views. But the fact is that our country needs him to lead the Department of Justice now more than ever.  I yield the floor.

The Native Americans, packers, prospectors, miners, homesteaders, trappers, ranchers, loggers, farmers, recreationists, conservationists, and more who have made homes in and traversed the county have contributed to its deep and fascinating history and shaped its culture. This expansive[[Page S1301]]county--approximately 2.4 million acres and roughly 3.7 thousand square miles--encompasses hundreds of lakes, three national forests, rivers, fish and wildlife habitat, streams, grassland, and mountainous landscapes. It is no wonder the county's stunning terrain continues to attract those who enjoy the outdoors.  The county's splendor and ruggedness are matched by the grace and determination of the more than 9,000 Idahoans who make the area home. Over the years, Valley County residents have faced booms and downturns in the mining, logging, and agriculture sectors with resilience and continue to forge ahead with collaborative efforts to increase economic opportunities. Mining, fueled by the Idaho Gold Rush, has roots in the county stretching back more than a century. Logging has also been a historically central part of the county's economic base, and efforts to reestablish these sectors continue.

10031,topic-id,883,"Madam President, I rise today in support of the amendment Senator Hirono and I are offering to protect Medicare and Medicaid for the millions of Americans who currently count on these programs for health coverage.  This week, some of our colleagues are beginning the process of repealing the health care law. I want to be clear. I don't think it is a perfect law. In fact, I have long agreed with many of my colleagues in saying it has work to do, and for years we put forward ideas on ways we can work together to improve it.  The repeal strategy we are debating this week, however, is not about improving the health care system. It is about taking people's health care away. And make no mistake, the consequences are very real. A repeal strategy, particularly with no alternative, would throw our health care system into chaos, taking away coverage from nearly 30 million people, increasing premiums on working Hoosiers and families across this country, and threatening to take us back to a time where anyone with a preexisting condition could not get coverage.  It doesn't have to be this way. If we are serious about improving health care in this country, we can do this work together. That is what the American people expect. Just as Hoosiers go to work every day to make life better for their families, they expect us to come to work and do the same thing. At the very least, they expect us to do no harm. Doctors swear by the Hippocratic Oath, where they pledge first and foremost to do no harm when they are treating patients. We should appreciate this. We should approach this debate in the same manner. Do no harm. That is the basis of the Hirono-Donnelly amendment.  ``Do no harm'' means not cutting Medicare benefits or turning it into a voucher program. ``Do no harm'' means protecting the health care of those who use the Medicaid program, many of whom have health care for the first time.  Here is what we know: Repealing the health care law reduces Medicare's insolvency by 5 years to 2021. We know that some in Congress, including the nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, are intent on privatizing Medicare or turning it into a voucher program, ending the program as we know it.  The Hirono-Donnelly amendment makes it clear that we will not privatize The amendment protects Medicare both for the seniors who count on the program to age in dignity and for the tens of millions of Americans who are contributing to the program with the expectation that it will be there when they retire.  ``Do no harm'' also means we will protect insurance coverage for those who get their care through the Medicaid program, which, after the passage of the health care law, enabled millions of our friends and our neighbors to access affordable coverage for the first time in their lives. I know this is true because I worked with and supported our soon-to-be Vice President, Mike Pence, when he used ObamaCare to establish a program we call the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0. The innovative plan expanded health care coverage to over 200,000 of my neighbors in our beloved State and helped reduce the uninsured rate among Hoosiers by 30 percent. The HIP 2.0 program has been critical in our ongoing effort to provide treatment to those struggling with opioid abuse and heroin use in our Don't just take my word for it. In his farewell address as Governor to Hoosiers yesterday, Mr.Pence said:       Our innovative Healthy Indiana Plan is a national model of      how to provide affordable health care coverage to our most      vulnerable citizens. . . . With HIP 2.0, we have also made      great strides expanding treatment for those who struggled in      the grip of drug addiction.  I agree with the Vice President-elect that HIP 2.0 is something we can be very proud of because it helps Hoosier families across our State every single day. And it was done by working together, Republicans and Democrats, using the health care law to provide access to our friends and neighbors who wouldn't be able to obtain insurance otherwise. That is a great result.  The repeal plan before us today takes all of this away, including the very program that Vice President-Elect Pence and I worked to put in place. The amendment Senator Hirono and I put forth is simple. It says to seniors and to people participating in HIP 2.0 and Medicaid plans across the country: We will do no harm.  I am happy to work with anyone to strengthen the health care law, but we are not going to take away the health care people have come to rely on. I urge my colleagues to support the Hirono-Donnelly amendment. Instead of going forward with a plan that creates chaos by repealing the health care law with no alternative, we should work together to improve it. That is just common sense. Most of all, we should strive to do no harm. That should be our guiding principle in the My colleagues on both sides of the aisle can demonstrate their commitment to this principle by supporting our amendment.  I yield the floor.

10012,topic-id,2735,"Mr.President, I was listening carefully to the comments made by my colleague from West I thank her for coming to the floor and expressing her feelings about the Affordable Care It is truly an article of political faith on the Republican side that we must repeal We have heard that for 6 years, maybe longer, and each and every time, Democrats have asked: And then what?  We have asked Republicans: What would you replace ObamaCare with? Until some of the most recent moments, there was never an answer. Now they are starting to put at least some ideas forward, but repealing ObamaCare and then talking about the possibility of replacement is a disaster. It is an invitation to uncertainty and chaos. We might expect that from a Democratic Senator who voted for the Affordable Care Act, but what I ask my colleagues in the Senate to do is, please go home. Please go back to your Do as I did yesterday. I called together the administrators of hospitals in Central Illinois, smalltown rural hospitals and larger hospitals such as Memorial Medical Center in my hometown of I asked them, in a nonpressurized setting: What would you do? What is wrong with the Affordable Care Act? How would you change it? What would be the impact of repeal?  I knew, and they did as well, that there had been some reports from the Congressional Budget Just last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office told us exactly what repeal without replace would look like: 18 million Americans would lose health insurance in 12 months, 32 million within 10 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if they went through with the Republican repeal plan, premiums in the individual health insurance market would increase by 20 to 25 percent the first year and double within 10 years.  Despite this, on his first day in office, President Trump signed an Executive order that began to dismantle our health care system. We still haven't seen the President's secret replacement plan, even though he has repeatedly said he wants to replace the law at the same time he repeals it, and we are going to be so proud of what he does.  Let's talk about what repeal without replace means in Illinois, now that I have taken it home and asked the people who are actually running the hospitals. With repeal, 90,000 young people[[Page S413]]in Illinois would be thrown off their parents' health care plans. More than 7 million Illinoisans with health insurance through their employer would once again be subject to discriminatory health insurance practices, like discrimination based on preexisting conditions, annual and lifetime caps on coverage, and discrimination against women. In my State, the Republican repeal plan would have an impact statewide because insurance plans statewide could once again decide not to cover maternity or newborn care, mental health, or substance abuse. Those things are required under the Affordable Care That would be removed with this repeal.  In my State, more than 1 million people would lose their health insurance--in fact, 1.2 million, to be exact. According to the Illinois Hospital Association, my State would lose $11 billion to $13 billion in annual economic activity with Republican repeal, translating to a loss of up to 95,000 jobs. Let me talk about those jobs in towns like Taylorville and Pana, IL, near my hometown of Those are good-paying jobs. Sometimes they are the best paying jobs in the community. Those would be the jobs lost by the Republican repeal of  For years, we have been hitting back against misguided and misleading claims about the Affordable Care Who is hitting back now? And not just hospitals. Health care providers across the board are pleading with the Republicans: We know you have some campaign promise you want to keep, but keep first your promise to the people you represent to provide quality, affordable health care.  Senator Tammy Duckworth and I have sent letters to every single Illinois hospital--over 200 of them--asking about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act without enacting a replacement to prevent total chaos. Just yesterday morning, I met with these hospital administrators and heard firsthand. I met at Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, IL, representatives from Hopedale Medical Center, Pana Community Hospital, Carlinville Area Hospital, and Warner Hospital and Health  Memorial Health System is a nonprofit, community-owned health care organization. When I asked about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act, here is what they told me: ``Repeal without replacing the ACA would adversely impact patients' access to care and our hospitals' and health systems' ability to provide services as well as potentially result in job losses.'' They went on to say that Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, with Republican repeal of ObamaCare, could lose over $140 million over the next 6 years, and their uncompensated care costs would ``rise dramatically due to both a rise in charity care and decline in Medicaid coverage and reimbursement.''  They cautioned:       We would be forced to cut spending by reducing services,      reducing staff, and delaying investment in new technology and      facility improvements. . . . Losses of this magnitude with      repeal of the [Affordable Care Act] coverage simply cannot be      sustained and would adversely impact patients' access to care      and our hospitals' and health systems' ability to continue to      provide services.  This is not the only hospital telling me in our I am from downstate Illinois, proud to represent Chicago, but I have represented in the Congress and in the Senate smalltown rural America, communities where the hospital makes a difference. If you don't have a hospital nearby, you could be an hour's drive--if you are lucky--from quality medical care, not to mention the impact that hospital has on the local economy, keeping and attracting new businesses.  According to the Illinois Hospital Association, the 15th Congressional District of Illinois stands to lose $470 million under Republican repeal of the Affordable Care That means 3,400 jobs lost in that congressional district in Central Illinois with repeal of affordable care. We talk about good jobs and creating them in this The President goes and makes trips, as he should, to try to save American jobs. Yet the first congressional action by the Republican majority this year is to threaten 3,400 jobs in the 15th Congressional  Washington County Hospital in Nashville, IL, is a 22-bed critical access hospital 50 miles from They provide acute care, surgical service, and gynecological services. When I asked them what Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean to Washington County Hospital in my downstate area, they said the following:       To eliminate [the ACA] would be detrimental to the      thousands of people in our county that were previously      uninsured either because of part-time work or serious health      problems.       I guarantee that [repealing the ACA] without a strategic      healthcare replacement plan, will result in more downsizing      and more staff reductions at Washington County Our      community cannot continue to lose these good paying jobs and      I believe our county residents will continue to move to      neighboring states with more favorable job markets, better      job security and stable benefits.  They ended their response with this warning:       I truly fear that many Illinois communities will lose their      Critical Access Hospitals--the only sources of healthcare in      many of our rural counties and a vital part of infrastructure      in our communities.       As you know, our rural areas have vulnerable populations of      elderly folks that have many chronic healthcare needs and      limited ability to travel long distances for emergency care.      . . . I sincerely hope that you heed the warnings of our      physicians and hospitals--do NOT repeal the ACA in a hurried      political rush.  Washington County is not a blue county, it is not a Democratic county. It is a county that votes regularly for the other party. It is a conservative-voting populous, representing a lot of farmers and small businesses, and this is their hospital administrator warning the Republicans here in the Senate and the House: Be careful what you do in eliminating the Affordable Care  According to the Illinois Hospital Association, the 16th Congressional District in Illinois stands to lose $453 million under Republican repeal of ObamaCare, and that means the loss of 3,300 jobs.  SwedishAmerican Hospital in Belvidere, IL, in the northern part of my State, provides health care to Belvidere, Boone, western McHenry, and northern DeKalb When asked how the hospital has fared since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the administrator of SwedishAmerican said the following:       The passage of ACA has afforded our health system with      significant benefit related to [compensation] of patients      with uncompensated care. . . . SwedishAmerican experienced an      average annual increase of $43 million in Medicaid payments,      and a $10 million reduction in uncompensated care.  When asked about the impact of the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act, SwedishAmerican Hospital of Belvidere, IL, said the following:       The impact would be significant . . . it would create an      unsustainable financial result and we would be forced to make      significant reductions in staff and curtail future plans for      capital expenditures.  Yesterday, at my roundtable in Springfield, I asked some of these hospital administrators: What is wrong with the Affordable Care Act? And they told me. Let me add quickly, I believe--as they do--there are things which need to be changed in that law. It is not perfect, by any means. They talked about the cost of care, and they should. In some areas, premiums have gone up too quickly, and the availability of insurance is not as it should be.  I have talked to the health insurance companies, including the big companies like Blue Cross Blue They have told me specifically that the method of enrollment now under the Affordable Care Act leaves loopholes for people to jump in and out of coverage as they need it. You cannot run a viable insurance risk pool if people are only forced to sign up when they are facing a health care crisis. You have to have healthy people paying premiums to cover those who get sick and need to be compensated.  So there are things certainly within the Affordable Care Act which need to be changed, and these administrators told us.  So I said: I hear commonly from my Republican friends, if we would just allow people to buy health insurance over State lines, there would be more competition.  They laughed. They said: You mean to say, if you heard that there was a health insurance plan in Alabama and you lived in Illinois, that you would buy health insurance there; is that the idea?[[Page S414]]  I said: I suppose. I hear it over and over again, if we could just buy policies across State lines.  They laughed. They said: Do you know what is going to happen? Do you know what happens when you buy insurance in Illinois and they tell you the hospitals and doctors who are eligible? You certainly want to have doctors in your home area eligible who may not be eligible under an Alabama plan. That makes sense.  Secondly, they said: If people outside the State who are truly sick start buying into Alabama to get lower premiums, the premiums are going to go up. They are going to engineer the risk pool to make sure that it is viable.  That is a notion that they rejected out of hand. I asked them about health savings accounts. That is another thing you hear over and over again. If people could just set aside nontaxable income and leave that in a pool of money to pay their copayments and other expenses, then there would be a disincentive to overutilize health care. These administrators said: But people who are living paycheck to paycheck don't have money to set aside--even non-taxable money to set aside at that point--and, ultimately, many of them would put off care they desperately need until they become even sicker.  Each one of these approaches has its critics. There are people who think we ought to look at it more carefully. I think that ought to be the bottom line. To my Republican majority, look at this carefully. It is not a matter of keeping a campaign promise; it is a matter of keeping a promise to the people you represent not to leave our health care system in chaos.  I hope President Trump and my congressional Republican colleagues are listening to what my constituents back home told me yesterday, things that they will hear themselves if they will go back home and listen to people who run the hospitals in the communities where the voters they represent live.  I wish to conclude with a quote on the subject from William Gorski, president and CEO of SwedishAmerican, who wrote to me. He said:       I must also speak forcefully as a former practicing      physician. Irrespective of any financial impact of repeal,      real lives are at stake here. President Obama's vision      recognized a great understanding of the importance of health      care access to the quality and outcomes of care. Any      diminishment of this access threatens the health and well-     being of millions of our fellow citizens. . . . My strong      view is that rather than repealing the ACA, we should be      looking for ways to refine and expand it.  That comes from a doctor. I solicited his view. I don't know him personally, but it represents the feelings of many.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the State Journal-Register article from Springfield, IL, on my meeting yesterday.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the State Journal-Register, 23, 2017]        Durbin Hears Hospitals' Concerns About Obamacare Repeal                            (By Dean Olsen)       Executives fromfrom Springfield-area hospitals and health      systems told U.Dick Durbin Monday morning that a      threatened repeal of the Affordable Care Act by Congress      would jeopardize local patients' access to medical services      and harm their organizations' finances.       ``We'd just hate to see this go away,'' Memorial Health      System chief executive officer Edgar Curtis said of the law,      also known as Obamacare, during a meeting at the Memorial      Center for Learning and Innovation with Durbin and leaders      from other hospitals.       Tina Casner, chief executive officer of Pana Community      Hospital in Christian County, said Illinois' expansion of      Medicaid eligibility--funded by the ACA--and reduced-price      private insurance sold through the state's health insurance      exchange have reduced the number of uninsured patients and      improved the 25-bed hospital's bottom line.       ``There are now folks in our community who are seeking that      care,'' she said.       Durbin, D-Springfield, said he doubted that congressional      Republicans pledging a comparable replacement of the ACA      would be able to fulfill their promise without big gaps in      coverage for many       Instead of ``repeal and replace''--the plan for the ACA      supported by local congressmen Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville,      and Darin LaHood, R-Dunlap--Curtis said he is ``very afraid''      that Congress instead will ``repeal and delay'' a decision on      a permanent replacement.       Action to repeal without a replacement is likely to cause      disruptions in care because more insurance companies would      pull out of the exchange and increase the prices of plans      even more, health-care industry officials have said.       Durbin, the 2 Democrat in the U.Senate, was told by      hospital administrators that the federal law isn't perfect      and needs to be tweaked, especially when it comes to the high      cost of private coverage and excessive paperwork.       ``I'm for that,'' he said.       But he and the administrators expressed concerns about      Republicans' plans to change Medicaid from a federal      entitlement program to a block grant given to individual      states as a way of getting control of Medicaid's rising cost      to the federal government.       The Illinois Health and Hospital Association has said block      grants for Medicaid could lead to reductions in funding in      Illinois, a state that already spends less per Medicaid      patient than almost all other states.       Jerry Kruse, dean and provost of Southern Illinois      University School of Medicine, said the expansion of Medicaid      eligibility ``has been really great for us.''       The expansion has decreased the uninsured rate by 80      percent for patients of SIU's federally subsidized outpatient      primary care clinic, the SIU Center for Family Medicine, he      said.       With insurance coverage, formerly uninsured patients are      less likely to worry about incurring medical bills they can't      afford to pay and more likely to seek care, Kruse said.       ``It's that peace of mind,'' he said.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS412-2.txt,326,1730,2017.0,24.0,January

10049,topic-id,2033,"Mr.President, there was debate on the Senate floor that went on for years. It was a personal thing, a personal issue with two Senators--one was a Republican, the other a The Republican was Senator Pete Domenici of New The Democrat was Senator Paul Wellstone of The two of them had teamed up with a very simple goal in mind. They wanted to make sure every health insurance policy in America covered mental illness.  When you think about the fact that so many Americans suffer from some form of depression and that mental illness is something that so many families--at some point or another--face, you wonder: Well, why didn't the health insurance policies cover mental illness? The reason, of course, was that it takes some extended, and oftentimes expensive, care to help those with mental illness. In other cases, there was an argument made that you will not find a cure.  Things have changed a lot in the world of mental illness over the last few decades and changed for the better. There are new medications that are available and some even better ones on the way. There is new treatment available and more hope for people. Pete Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico, and Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota, did not give up. They insisted on it, and they won.  They won with the requirement that health insurance policies cover not just mental illness and treatment but also substance abuse treatment. I will be honest with you. I followed that debate closely. I did not pay that much attention, at the time, to the substance abuse treatment part of their effort. Now I have. I think many people across America have. There was a supplement in the Chicago Sun Times this morning, published by USA It is entitled ``Obamacare repeal jeopardizes mental health, addiction coverage.''  I tore it out of the paper on the airplane to bring it to the floor of the Senate because this a good day for us to reflect on what this article has to say. We are now in the midst of the budget resolution effort that is designed by the Republican majority to repeal  The Republicans hate They hate it almost as much as the devil hates holy water. They have tried for 6 years to repeal it with a singular focus. I don't know how many times they voted in the House--some said over 60 times--to repeal it. They have said that for so many years, and we have said to them: What will you do after you repeal it? They said: Well, we have a plan. For 6 years, they have said: We have a plan to replace it.  We have never seen it. No one has ever seen it. It raises the question about whether they do have a plan. They certainly have a plan to repeal it, but when it comes to replacing it, they don't offer anything--but they are going to go ahead with it. They are bent on doing this regardless of the outcome. For a lot of people across America, this could be devastating. This article talks about a family in Kentucky, the home State of the Republican leader. Melissa Fleckinger of Edgewood, She had to pay for heroin treatment for her daughter Amanda before the Affordable Care Her son Brian's treatment for heroin addiction was covered by the ACA, but unfortunately he died of an overdose in 2015.  This article goes on to talk about what it means to have children who are addicted to drugs and parents who are desperately trying to find treatment. Some of the things that are said in the course of this are really worrisome because this article spells out what happens to families without health insurance that covers substance abuse treatment. They become helpless, unable to take care of their kids.  The Republicans have come back and said: Well, we will just do a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Listen to what this articles says:  Almost any route taken on Capitol Hill leads to an unraveling of addiction and mental health coverage for those people. Even the partial ACA repeal Congress is considering would eliminate the tax credits that reduce the premiums for about 85 percent of the people who buy insurance on the exchanges. Most of those who get the tax credits pay less than $100 a month for health insurance and have very low out-of-pocket costs that make it possible for them to afford coverage.  What they go on to say here is that putting a requirement in the health insurance policy that it cover mental health illness and substance abuse treatment means nothing if the people cannot afford to pay the premiums for the health insurance policy. So the Republican plan that would eliminate the tax credits families need to be able to afford the policy means there is no way they are going to get coverage for themselves and their kids.  Who is going to be affected by that? I will tell you what I found in What I found in Illinois is that the current opioid and heroin epidemic is everywhere. There is no town too small, and there is no suburb too wealthy to avoid it--story after story of teenagers and young people addicted who have no place to turn.  If the Republicans have their way in the Senate and the House, they will close the door for many of these young people. I see my colleague from the State of New I was stunned to read--I don't know if it is still the case, but I was stunned to read several months ago that when you look at the average number of deaths from opioids[[Page S139]]and heroin across the Nation--and Illinois is, I am not making any excuses here, we are average--the rate of death for heroin-opioid overdoses in West Virginia is twice the national average, and the rate in New Hampshire is three times the national average.  Listen to what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in New I might say to the Senator from New Hampshire that she is quoted in this article.       Repealing the ACA would cause [in New Hampshire] nearly      120,000 people to lose coverage in the State, where federal      data show a nearly 200% increase in overdose deaths in the      past five years. More than 48,000 Medicaid claims were for      substance use disorder in 2015, making an ACA repeal [in the      words of Senator Shaheen] ``literally a matter of life and      death.''       At the Cincinnati Center for Addiction Treatment, CEO      Sandra Kuehn said about 30% of Kuehn's patients are covered      for treatment because of the expansion [under ACA]. Overdose      deaths in Ohio climbed from 2,531 in 2014 to 3,050 in 2015,      up more than 20 percent.        The home State of the Republican Senate leader.       Overdose deaths here totaled 1,248 in 2015, up 17% from the      previous year. Fentanyl--which is much stronger than heroin--     was involved in 420 fatal overdoses in 2015, up nearly 250%      over the previous year.  The lady who was quoted earlier who lost her son to the overdose was not surprised. She knows several other people who have overdosed and many others who have died, including one last week.        I am proud to represent it.       Up to 30% of the 9,000 inmates in the Cook County Jail have      a diagnosed mental illness. . . . ``The ACA has been a game      changer for those who were in and out of Cook County Jail,''      says Mark Ishaug, CEO of Thresholds, a Chicago treatment      provider. It costs less than $20,000 a year for Threshold's      highest level of community-based mental-health care with a      housing voucher. . . .  So $20,000 a year or less than that. Do you know what it costs to incarcerate that same person? It costs $70,000 a year to incarcerate them. About one-third of the patients being treated by Thresholds are covered by the Affordable Care What is the alternative, I say to my Republican friends. They can't wait to repeal this, but they don't have an alternative.  Meanwhile, in Illinois, in New Hampshire, in Maine, and every State in the Nation, mental illness is still a challenge, and substance abuse is on the rise and people are dying from heroin and opioid overdoses. This is the height of irresponsibility, to repeal this measure with no replacement. It is sad to say we have reached this point where a political score has to be settled now that the Republicans are in control of the House and the  Now that they have an incoming President, the Republicans finally get their day. Someone said to me: Why is public sentiment starting to change on this issue and even among Republican politicians? I said: They have been saying irresponsible things for a long time, but now people are taking them seriously. As they take them seriously, they realize what a devastating impact it is going to have.  Nicholas Kristof wrote in the New York Times last week:       If the Republicans ran a home renovation business, they      would start tearing down your roof this month and promise to      return in 2019 with some options for a new one--if you      survived.  Last week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote an op-ed arguing that repeal should not be done without simultaneously being replaced. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has said that repealing the law without replacing it is ``a flawed concept'' and that having a replacement ready first would be a more ``prudent approach'' in the Republican Senator's words.  Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has said she would like to see ``detailed framework'' accompanying any repeal.  Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said: ``I don't think we can just repeal ObamaCare and say we are going to get the answer 2 years from now.''  Over and over again, these Republican Senators are realizing how totally irresponsible it would be if we go forward with this proposal. I will tell you what troubles me as a representative of a State that has the great city of Chicago and a wonderful metropolitan area. I come from the other end of the State, the rural part of our I wonder what is going to happen to our rural hospitals if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. I think about Franklin Hospital in Benton, IL, population, 7,300. The hospital has been there 60 years. In the past 15 years, it has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. It all changed 6 years ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of our Medicaid Program in  Because of those changes, Franklin Hospital found they could survive. Expanding Medicaid cut Franklin Hospital's uncompensated care in half. In Franklin's emergency room, they saw 600 fewer no-pay patients and 428 more Medicaid patients compared to the previous year. This, combined with increases in Medicaid funding, allowed Franklin Hospital to invest in much needed improvements and to consider bringing nuclear medicine and a retail pharmacy to Benton, What does that mean in that city? Well, it means all the difference in the world. There is something else that has to be said. If that hospital--Franklin Hospital in Benton--closes, it will not just mean a longer drive for critical health care, it is going to mean job losses. It will mean the loss of 4,300 jobs in the 12th congressional district, where Franklin Hospital is located.  So when the President-elect talks about saving 6 or 800 jobs at Carrier Corporation, good; I am glad. But then for his party to turn around and pass a measure which could kill 84,000 to 95,000 jobs in Illinois, that is a move in the wrong direction. I say to my Republican friends, go home and talk to the people you represent. Listen to what they have to say about what we are doing--addiction, mental illness, and rural hospitals that are on the brink of closing, if you have your way politically. This is no victory for the people of America to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement that is as good or better.  I yield the floor.

10070,topic-id,717,"Mr.President, this may be one of the most important votes in this new session of the Senate relative to the Trump administration. It is a Cabinet position most people are not aware of, except if you work here. It is the Director of the Office of Management and  This individual has the authority to write the President's budget, to establish priorities, and to review Federal spending governmentwide. It is a big job. It is an awesome responsibility. The way it is executed will not only lead to an accounting of our Federal expenditures, but it will have a direct impact on America's economy.  The choice of Congressman Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina for this job is wrong. It is wrong based on his record in the House of He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in the House of That is a group which led to the resignation of Speaker Boehner and continues to tie the House of Representatives into knots. Why? Because they have certain tactics they believe are credible tactics, which Congressman Mulvaney signed up for. Let me give one of them.  They think closing down the government is a good way to get people's attention. Well, they are right. It sure gets attention. But it does it at the expense of innocent people across America--taxpayers, those who are receiving critical programs, and Federal employees who are waiting for their paychecks. Congressman Mulvaney signed up for that.  Once every year or so we have to decide to lift what is called the debt ceiling, which is the indebtedness of the United States, the full faith and credit of our government--really, the credibility of our government when it comes to financing. Congressman Mulvaney, who wants to head the Office of Management and Budget, has said we can default on our national debt, and it really won't cause that great of a problem. That is just the beginning of some of his bizarre views.  He said he wants to end the Medicare program as we know it. He calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He has called for a 25-percent reduction in reimbursement for Medicaid; that is health insurance for children, the disabled, and the elderly in He also has questioned whether the United States as a government should continue to invest in medical research.  I am not making this up. This man who wants to set the priorities for the Trump administration and deliver the budget for America's future questions whether our Federal Government should invest in medical research.  When it came to paying for natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy--and it happens to every State--he decided that instead of coming to the rescue of people in an emergency, we would have to cut entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as well as military spending, in order to pay for disasters. That is how shortsighted he has been, and President Trump has chosen him to write the budget for  I just have to say that his priorities as a founding member of the Freedom Caucus disqualify him for this job, in my consideration. The fact that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement and leave some 30 million insured Americans without the promise of healthcare security for their families is another indication of an extreme point of view which should not be defining our government in  I have no doubt Republicans are going to march in lockstep, with maybe one exception. Senator McCain has said he is going to vote against him.

10071,topic-id,903,"Mr.President, when I woke up this morning I was remembering some of the Old West stories about catching the culprit and hanging him. Then we got a little more sophisticated out West, and we said: You know, we need to give that person a fair trial and then hang him.  Sometimes I feel like these Cabinet position hearings are exactly that. They let the person ask questions. They ask very leading questions. I am not sure anybody listens to the answers. Then they have to answer a whole bunch of questions. I am not sure anybody reads the answers to those questions, and if they do, any time you read something, there can be a certain bias that is built into it. I am sorry that is happening to Cabinet after Cabinet after Cabinet position.  Traditionally, a President has gotten the Cabinet that he wanted, often in the first week that he was in. Some of them got it on the first day they were in.  This is a key position for the But we have to remember that he doesn't get to make any final decisions. He gets to recommend to the President and make a presentation to the President on what there ought to be, and then the President presents a budget.  Looking back over the last 8 years, we have voted on the President's budget. For 7 years, the President got zero votes. That means his budget did not go into place. In the eighth year, he got one vote. I am hoping that Representative Mulvaney can do a considerably better job than that in outlining what our needs are, presenting it to the President, and getting some agreement so that we can get this country on a plan to where we can quit increasing the $20 trillion debt burden which faces us because of the 8 years of anemic economic and policy growth we have had.  With unprecedented attempts to delay the new Cabinet, Senate Democrats have ensured the President has been without an OMB Director longer than any other President in the past 40 years. The reason I use 40 years is that is as long as that position has been in place.  According to Senate records, from President Jimmy Carter to President Obama, the longest it ever took to approve a first budget director for new Presidents was 1 week--1 week. We are now in week 4 and with little movement. As Majority Leader McConnell said last week, this is the slowest time for a new Cabinet to be up and running since President George Washington--and that was last week that he said that.  It is vital we fill this position. I am hopeful Mr.Mulvaney and the OMB will ensure that the taxes of hard-working Americans sent to Washington are spent in the most effective and efficient way. The Federal Government has not been currently focused on making sure hard-working taxpayers get the best deal for their money. A new OMB Director focused on responsible budgeting can help ensure the duplication of government programs and agencies is discovered and it is addressed. This will help the Federal Government to be more accountable and more effective.  I remember walking over to the inauguration next to the new Senator from Maryland, who talked to me about Mulvaney and said that he was kind of impressed that the two of them had agreed on some budgetary principles. That was a bit of a shock to me.  The Government Accountability Office every year outlines tens of billions of dollars in savings that can be achieved through various efficiency measures. OMB can play an important role in ensuring that spending programs don't duplicate each other. That is what Mulvaney is excited about. Additionally, reforming and consolidating these programs can ensure they focus on real needs and be managed with an eye toward real results.  Several years ago, Congress passed a law requiring the administration to list all Federal programs on a central governmentwide website, along with related budget and performance information, maybe saying how many people work there and how many customers they serve. Unfortunately, when the program lists were put online, GAO reviewed the information and discovered that the inventory, in their own words, was ``not a useful tool for decisionmaking.'' That has to change. Mulvaney can change that. Even if the government can't answer that question, we can find strong evidence that the numbers are on the rise, and Mr.Mulvaney will be able to play a crucial role in taming the unchecked growth of the Federal  To conclude, I have full faith in Representative That is why I am asking you today to take my word for his capability. I do take my word very seriously. Please support Representative Mulvaney for this important position and get this position onboard so we can do the work that we are supposed to do--one of which is to get a budget from the President by today. That is not going to be possible because he doesn't have anybody to do the budget yet. Then, we can get on with the business of this country. We have been working on some bipartisan budget processes that we can do. We will get that done, too, with his help, with the President's help, and with help from both sides of the aisle.

9822,topic-id,583,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr.Doyle, for both his leadership and for yielding time to me.  America, listen up today. There may not be that many people on the floor of the House, but this is a big one. This is really a big one. Congress is poised today to betray the American people on one of the issues they care the most about: their privacy--their privacy. Every single one of us cares about it, and so do the American people. I often say that every American has it in their DNA: Keep your mitts off my privacy, what I consider to be private.  Now, the consequences of passing this resolution are clear. Broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission, and no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about. It is like open the door and there is no one there. That is what this thing creates.  The Republicans are blowing a gaping hole in Federal privacy protections by barring the FCC from ever adopting similar protections in the future. So, if it is gone today, it is gone, period.  The FCC rules are simple. They require broadband providers to get the permission of their customers--including all of us--before they can sell their web browsing history, their location information, and other sensitive data to third parties.  The majority claims that we need to repeal these protections because they treat broadband providers differently than other online service providers, edge providers. Broadband providers are in the unique position of seeing everything we do on the internet. This is the reason, and it is reason enough, to put privacy protections in place; but it is also important to keep in mind that consumers, all of us, pay a high monthly fee to broadband providers, and they face serious barriers if they want to switch. If I want to switch, if you want to switch, you have to, many times, pay early termination fees.  This is completely different from other online services that collect consumer data. Consumers don't pay to use search engines or social media applications like Google and If they don't like Google's privacy policy, they can switch over to Bing without paying any fees. But consumers can't do this with broadband providers, and therein lies the difference.  Last week, we heard the Republicans bemoan the lack of choice in the healthcare market. They should take a closer look at the state of the broadband market, particularly in rural America, where only 13 percent of consumers have access to more than one high-speed broadband provider.  So the majority is telling Americans today, particularly those in rural areas, that they need to choose between their privacy and their access to the internet. If this resolution passes, people across the country will certainly not have both.  This resolution is--excuse the phrase--repeal without replace. The Republicans have not put forward any privacy proposal at all to replace the FCC's rules, despite knowing that repealing these rules will leave a gap in the Federal protections.  So the message to the American people is clear: Your privacy doesn't matter, and your web browsing history should be available to anyone who will pay the highest price for it.  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand up for privacy rights and oppose this joint resolution.

9962,topic-id,921,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to defeat a Congressional Review Act resolution that would weaken the FBI's gun background check system and make it easier for individuals with severe mental illness to buy guns.  Gun violence is an epidemic in our communities--killing more than 30,000 people each year; yet this resolution would prevent the. Federal Government from taking even the most basic steps to improve enforcement of current gun laws.  It blocks a rule that requires the Social Security Administration to report to the FBI background check system individuals who have a severe mental illness that prevents them from managing their own affairs. This determination is made during the application process for Social Security disability benefits.  This policy could have prevented tragedies like that of Janet Delana and[[Page S1168]]her daughter Colby was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 201l. She received Social Security disability payments as a result of her mental illness and lived with her parents in A year after her diagnosis, Colby used the money from her disability check to buy a gun at a local dealer. Her mom called the dealer and begged him not to make the sale. Janet explained that her daughter was mentally ill and suicidal and that she would likely use the gun to harm herself or others. Nonetheless, Colby passed her background check and bought the gun. Just an hour later, Colby shot her father to death and tried to kill herself. Janet's now a widow, and Colby lives in an institution. Their story didn't have to end that way. We should all agree that severely mentally ill individuals like Colby should not have access to guns. Federal law already says that individuals with severe mental illness are barred from purchasing or possessing guns. Yet time and again, we have seen prohibited purchasers like Colby pass background checks. That is because the background check system does not have records of all mentally ill individuals barred from buying guns.  While the background check system has denied gun transfers to 1.3 million prohibited individuals--including felons, drug addicts, and fugitives--it isn't perfect. There are individuals like Colby whose information should be in the system--but isn't. We need to improve the background check system and ensure information that is supposed to be in the system is in fact included.  A recent report by the Police Foundation and Major Cities Chiefs Association noted that this is critically important if we are going to reduce violent crime in our country. The 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech--the second deadliest mass shooting in our history--could have been prevented if we had a better background check system. Seung-Hui Cho, an angry, mentally disturbed individual, slaughtered 32 students and teachers and wounded many others. After the massacre, we learned that Cho in 2005 had been ordered to attend psychiatric treatment and a judge ruled that he presented ``an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness.'' As a consequence of this judge's determination, Cho's name should have been entered in the NICS database. But it wasn't--that is because the FBI didn't have the records.  In response to the shooting, Congress in 2007 unanimously approved the NICS Improvement Amendments Act to improve record keeping in the background check system. Senators Ted Kennedy, Pat Leahy, Chuck Schumer, and Tom Coburn worked together on the bill, and President Bush signed it into law. The bill was supported by both the National Rifle Association and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun That never happens.  It is this bill--passed unanimously and supported by the gun lobby--that required the Social Security Administration to issue the rule we are debating today. The Social Security Administration engaged in a painstaking process over the past year to develop this policy. It received more than 90,000 comments from advocates and members of the public. The rule was carefully crafted to identify individuals like Colby, while protecting due process.  The majority of individuals with mental illness do not commit acts of violence, and they would not be affected by this rule. The rule covers only individuals with serious conditions, including schizophrenia, who need additional assistance to manage their affairs. This determination is made following an extensive review of medical evidence, which takes place before the person is approved for Social Security disability benefits.  The rule further specifies that it would only apply to prospective claimants--starting in December 2017. That means it would not apply to individuals who already receive disability benefits. Repealing this rule through the Congressional Review Act would not only overturn the policy that's been developed. It would block the Social Security Administration from ever taking action to implement the NICS Improvement Act and report mentally ill individuals to the  Time and time again, my Republican colleagues respond to horrific mass shootings by saying that we don't need any new gun laws. We just need to better enforce the gun laws we already have. That is exactly what this rule aims to do--improve enforcement of current law and make sure people already barred from buying guns can't buy guns.  So, the question comes: What won't Republicans do to appease the gun lobby?  We lose more than 30,000 people to gun violence each year in this country, many of whom are mentally ill and commit suicide. It should shock the conscience of the American people the Senate is considering weakening our Federal background check system in response to this unabated epidemic of violence.  I urge my colleagues to vote against repealing the Social Security Administration's rule. Thank you.

9824,topic-id,651,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the balance of her time to me.  Mr.Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the House companion to S.34, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to support the resolution before us today. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I care deeply about protecting the privacy of our constituents, but I cannot support the Federal Communications Commission's counterproductive rules that will actually harm consumers and stifle innovation.  For 20 years, the Federal Trade Commission--or the FTC, as we call it, frequently--oversaw consumer privacy for the entire internet ecosystem: content providers, advertisers, and internet service providers, or The FTC's privacy program focused on preserving sensitive consumer data and took the context of a consumer's relationship with businesses into consideration. The FTC's experience in implementing a wide range of rules and regulations has resulted in over 500 cases protecting consumer information, ensuring their privacy online.  In a flawed political move, absent any finding, complaints, or investigations to determine whether broadband providers have violated consumers' privacy or that the FTC had failed at doing its job, the FCC proceeded with a partisan vote to target ISPs and to expand its regulatory footprint.  After stripping the FTC of its authority over the privacy practices of internet service providers, the FCC subsequently adopted rules that would harm consumers and split the internet, creating an uneven playing field between service providers and content providers. Congress must fix this overreach so the new administration can create a comprehensive, consistent set of privacy protections.                              {time}  1615  Consumers expect their privacy to be protected the same way no matter what type of entity holds their data. Having two sets of requirements creates confusion for consumers and may jeopardize their confidence in the internet.  Our internet economy has thrived under the privacy regime created by the Yet the FCC, under its previous Chairman, Tom Wheeler, wanted to undermine that success by bifurcating privacy protections to serve outside political interests, not the American consumer.  By contrast, the FCC's approach did not base its requirements on consumers' preferences about sensitive information and to set opt-in and opt-out defaults. Accordingly, its overall approach was top-down, heavyhanded regulation in stark contrast to the FTC's greater reliance on markets and consumer preferences.  The FCC's rule has a number of problematic issues:  The first is that the opt-in/opt-out regime reduces consumer choice and would be detrimental to the survival of many businesses in this country.  The second is that the FCC would have prohibited unforeseeable future uses of collected data regardless of what consumers actually preferred and businesses may need.  Third, the FCC would also have unjustly applied its heavyhanded approach to broadband providers, treating them more harshly than other players in the internet ecosystem.  In sum, the FCC's broadband privacy protection approach would have rejected free markets and ignored sound economics.  Alternatively, the FTC private enforcement is market oriented and flexible and adaptable to changes in consumer preferences and markets. It also treats companies and players neutrally, fostering an environment of competition and innovation.  This resolution rescinds the FCC's rule, but it does provide the FCC the opportunity to provide oversight more in line with the FTC, which has been successfully regulating online privacy for nearly two decades.  This joint resolution does not lessen or impede privacy and data security standards that have already been established. We are simply restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that consistent, uniform privacy security standards are maintained to protect consumers and future innovation.  Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to cooperating with[[Page H2494]]the FTC to ensure that both consumer privacy across all aspects of the internet is provided through vigorous enforcement and also that innovation is allowed to flourish.

Mr.Speaker, since 1973, as my colleague before me said, at least 58 million children's lives have been tragically taken by abortion in the United Over these last 44 years, science has made the facts increasingly clear: the unborn child in his or her mother's womb is a member of the human family, fully alive and simply awaiting the right conditions before joining the rest of us in the world.  Our laws should recognize and uphold the dignity of these unborn children. And thankfully, we have made significant progress in this endeavor since the decision of Roe v.

10097,topic-id,511,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.66.  The Obama administration spent a lot of time and taxpayer dollars emphasizing the need to protect retirement savers, but as was often the case with the previous administration, their rhetoric rarely matched their actions.  For example, the Obama Department of Labor spent years advancing a flawed rule that will limit access to affordable retirement advice for low- and middle-income families. Despite repeated calls for a more responsible approach, the Department pushed forward with an extreme, partisan rule. Then, late last year, the Department finalized two additional rules that will also negatively impact the retirement security of workers. The administration crafted a regulatory loophole that allows States to establish government-run IRAs by circumventing protections workers and employers have enjoyed for decades.  As was usually the case, the actions of the previous administration hurt the very people it claimed to be helping. First, this loophole would lead to fewer protections for retirement savers. Working families will have less information about how their retirement plans are managed, and they will have fewer options if those plans are not managed well. They will also have less control over the money they worked so hard to put away.  We need to honor hardworking taxpayers, Mr.Speaker, who save for their retirement and not have the Federal Government do things to harm them.  The loophole also threatens to inflict significant harm on small business employees. It is already hard enough for many small businesses to provide their employees with retirement options, and this regulation only makes it less likely they will do so. In fact, many small businesses could actually be discouraged from offering 401(k)s or other private sector options. Others could cancel their retirement plans and dump their employees into government-run retirement plans.  Finally, the Obama administration's regulatory action puts taxpayers at risk. We already know that many government-run pension plans for public employees are woefully underfunded. Let me repeat that, Mr.We already know that many government-run pension plans for public employees are woefully underfunded. If government-run IRAs for private sector workers are mismanaged, does anyone seriously believe hardworking taxpayers won't be asked to foot the bill?  These may be unintended consequences, but they will be detrimental to workers, retirees, and small business all the same. Too many hardworking men and women struggle to plan for the future and retire with financial security and peace of mind. The resolution under consideration today will close a loophole that threatens that security and peace of mind.  To be clear, these resolutions will not prevent States and cities from providing workers and retirees with new, innovative retirement options. These resolutions will simply ensure that all workers and retirees enjoy the same protections that have been guaranteed for decades.  I want to thank Representatives Walberg and Rooney for leading this effort and working to protect the retirement security of hardworking men and women across the country. I urge my colleagues to support both resolutions.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1206.txt,1791,OBAMACARE,2017.0,15.0,March

10057,topic-id,1632,"Mr.President, like my colleagues here today, I rise to talk about the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care I have been talking to a lot of people in Minnesota who have health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, or whose lives are changed by the protections in the ACA that benefit every Frankly, they are scared, hard-working people for whom this is literally life or death. If their health insurance is taken away, they do not know what they are going to do.  Today, on their behalf, I have one request for my Republican colleagues: Show us your health care plan. You must have one. We would like to hear it. We would like to see it now. You can understand the question, right? If your child had cancer and the Affordable Care Act was the reason you could get health insurance, you wouldn't want to rip up the ACA before knowing what would replace it. I am not the only Senator with constituents whose lives are on the line here, so I know that you don't intend to rip up the Affordable Care Act and leave them with nothing. You have to have a plan, right? So let's just see it.  Last week, President Obama said that if Republicans produce a plan that is ``demonstrably better than ObamaCare,'' he would support it, and so will Just show it to me. President-Elect Trump clearly has a plan. He laid it out, laid it all out during his campaign. His plan was, he said, to ``repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something terrific.'' That is what he said. Then he went into a little more detail and explained that ``something terrific'' would be ``so much better, so much better, so much better.''  So much better. That sounds great. Let's see it. One of Trump's top advisers said on MSNBC: ``We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.'' Neither do we. Speaker Ryan said that there will ``be a bridge so that no one is left out in the cold, so that no one is worse off.'' That is wonderful. No one being worse off is exactly what we want to see.  I am sure Speaker Ryan's staff was mistaken when they later told a reporter that the ``no one worse off'' applied only to the transition period, not to the replacement period. Show me the plan, please. Please show me the plan that keeps coverage for the 20 million people who have gained coverage that would continue to bend the cost curve so the cost of the entire health care system continues to grow less quickly than it did before ACA was adopted, the plan that would ensure that nobody gets denied coverage when they need it or has to unfairly pay more than someone else because of their gender or a preexisting condition. Show me that plan.  I know Republicans have put forward some different plans, a lot of different plans, but a lot of plans is not a plan. A lot of plans is not a plan. We want to see the plan, you know, the one you have been working on for 6 years. I was here in 2009 when we passed the I know how hard it was. If I could, let me offer you something. Some of your Republican friends actually did come up with a health care plan a while ago. It all started at the Heritage Foundation, which is a bona fide conservative think tank.  Over at Heritage, they did not like the idea of single-payer health care insurance, where the government is everyone's insurer. So what they wanted to come up with was a way to use the magic of the marketplace to solve the problem of providing everyone access to insurance.  Here is what they came up with, a three-legged stool. The first leg is, insurance companies can't deny coverage to people with a preexisting condition. They can't charge them more. We can all agree on that, right? President-Elect Trump and I agree on that, for sure. It is a great idea--great idea--but there is a catch. If you can not turn people down because of preexisting conditions, you cannot charge them more, well then everyone would just wait to buy health insurance until they get sick and need care. But the whole idea of health insurance is that at any given moment, most of the people paying premiums are healthy. So their premiums cover the cost of the people who are sick.  If the only people with insurance are sick, the premiums will skyrocket. So you need a way to get healthy people into the system to bring the cost of insurance down, which brings us to leg 2. Everyone has to be insured, otherwise known as the individual mandate. Everyone has to be insured. The Heritage Foundation said that. They called it the free rider syndrome. They said, no, everyone has to be insured.  This is what conservatives now say they hate; that the government says everyone has to buy insurance. But if you have to sell everyone insurance, then everyone has to buy it or the cost explodes. Now, look, if you have a better way to keep people covered and keep costs down, show me the plan. Show me the plan. But this is the best one the Heritage Foundation could come up with.  But wait, what if someone can't afford that health insurance? That brings us to the third leg. The government will subsidize insurance for people who can't afford it. There you have it, the Heritage Foundation plan, which a Republican Governor then implemented in a State to huge success.  Let me ask you, my Republican friends, is that your plan? Because if it is, it works for me. Guess what. Then we don't even have to repeal the Affordable Care Act in order to replace it with this plan because this plan was the model for the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Premiums went up a lot this fall for people buying insurance through the marketplace.  It is often ignored that subsidies cover the cost increases for about 70 percent of those folks, but for many those increases genuinely hurt. That is a real problem. Then the solution to it is to recognize that subsidies don't provide enough help and don't go to enough people. Let's fix that. There are places where there is not enough competition. The best and most direct solution that I know of is to introduce a public option.  If my Republican colleagues have another idea about how to address these costs and competition issues that would ensure that people don't lose their coverage, I am ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work. While we are honest about the shortcomings, let's not forget the bottom line. As a primary care doctor for Indiana University's Health Physicians said, ``I've been a registered Republican my whole life, but I support the Affordable Care Act because it allows patients to be taken care of.''  For 6 years, you have been blasting the ACA, promising to replace it with something better. Let's see what you have, but don't just tell me your plan. I want you to join me on a trip to Minnesota to see Dolly is one of my constituents who wrote to me about her husband's pulmonary embolism. Before the ACA, she and her husband both had jobs that did not offer health insurance, but once the ACA passed, they were able to buy insurance and go to the doctor.  The doctor discovered her husband's embolism and saved his life. I would like you to look Dolly in the eye and explain how your plan--your plan--will ensure that her husband's life will not be endangered.  I would like you to join me in talking to Before the ACA became law, Gina's father was undergoing treatment for leukemia. Then one day he was told he had hit the lifetime maximum on his insurance coverage. From that point on, the family would have to[[Page S149]]pay for his treatment out of pocket, but they did not have the money so they stopped treatment. Gina's father died 3 days later.  Since then, Gina's fiance was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. So I want you to explain to Gina how exactly under your plan Gina will not face the same kind of impossible financial situation with her future husband's condition that she did with her dad. Sit down with Gina and tell her that.  Now, once you are done calming Gina's concerns about what your plan might do to her family, we will go over and talk to Leanna's 3-year-old son Henry has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His treatment will last until at least April of 2018. He often needs around-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain, and sleepless nights. Little Henry's immune system is so compromised that he is not supposed to go to daycare. So Leanna has left her job to take care of him. They are supported by her spouse, but they could not pay for his treatment on one salary.  Leanna says:       It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper health      care. Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to      maintain his health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is      still with us because of the  Let me say that again. ``Henry is still with us because of the ACA.'' I want you to sit down with Leanna, as she holds her precious 3-year-old son, and explain how Henry will still be with us under your plan. Show us your plan. Show us your plan.  I yield the floor.

People want to know what is happening in  I suspect a good many of us are trying to figure out what the next steps are. It seems like every other moment something new is erupting from the White House, another tweet or another executive order, and we have had a lot of them. And so what I want to do today is to kind of go back and take a look at what has transpired over these last 2\1/2\ weeks. What has happened in Washington these last 2\1/2\ weeks?  Besides a lot of confusion, angst, and concern, some very, very important things are happening, and here is my take on it. I am going to kind of put a title on today, and I am going to say: What has Washington done to you, not for you. What has Washington done to you?  Let's start with the very first day that President Trump was inaugurated. Well, it was all about the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as So he set out to begin the repeal of ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care  Oh, by the way, they are one and the same. It depends which way you are looking at this thing, but the repeal of the Affordable Care Act has dire consequences on  Some 30 million Americans could be affected, according to the Congressional Budget Office, or in my State, we are looking at maybe 5 million people could lose their health coverage, their insurance, as a result of that. There is $16 billion that immediately flows to the State of California for the expansion of the Medicaid, Medi-Cal program in That would be gone. And those people that are on that program would simply not be able to get care.  It goes beyond just those who are in the exchanges. The exchange in California is working quite well. Maybe a 1\1/2\ million people in California are covered through the exchange, and they have options in most every part of the  In my part of the State, there are some shortcomings because services are not readily available, but there are 34 clinics managed by nine organizations that provide medical services in my district. Every one of those clinics rely upon ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, for the services that they render. If the Affordable Care Act disappears, we repeal ObamaCare, those clinics are out of business.  And what does that mean? It means that thousands, literally hundreds of thousands of people in my district would no longer be receiving medical[[Page H1060]]services through the clinics, through the Affordable Care Act's expansion, or through the Medi-Cal program. This is serious business.  There is another piece to this, and I would like to put up some charts on that, but let's just go back and quickly review the benefits. The benefits are:  5.1 million seniors receive savings on prescription drugs. You know that famous drug doughnut hole; it has almost disappeared as the result of the ObamaCare Affordable Care  32.5 million seniors receive free annual preventions, health checkups, every year. What does that mean? It means their blood pressure is checked out, their potential for diabetes, for other chronic illnesses, and they get the medicine for diabetes. They get better health care, and the cost of Medicare is reduced.  Also, it strengthens consumer protections for seniors in Medicare part D, and at least 85 percent of Medicare Advantage Plans' revenues go back towards providing senior services. That is just for seniors.  So there are many, many benefits in the Affordable Care Act beyond just those that are getting new insurance policies. It is a big deal for seniors. They are able to get an annual checkup. They are able to get their drugs much cheaper, able to provide them with the necessary pieces of it.  One of the very first acts that has been taken up here by Congress is the budget resolution passed by both It is now in effect, the first budget resolution, and that budget resolution tells the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means Committee: Repeal the taxes that are associated with the Affordable Care It is a lot of money, somewhere between $700 million and $1 trillion of tax cuts directly associated with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,  Who gets the benefit of those tax reductions? Well, the top 1 percent would receive some 70 percent of the benefit.  What does that amount to? Well, it amounts to--did I say 1 percent? The top one-tenth of 1 percent would receive the great majority of the benefit, or $200,000 tax reduction for the super-superwealthy. The rest of them, the top 1 percent, get 57 percent of that $700 billion, and that is over a 10-year period. And everyone else, that would be the other 99 percent, will share in a much smaller portion, the remaining 43 percent.  For an average family, it probably amounts to maybe a tax reduction of $160. However, those are the people that are able to get their insurance through the exchanges, and so they are getting a really bad deal because the average exchange, for example, in California, is somewhere over $2,500.  So this is the tax repeal. It is a massive tax cut for the super-superwealthy.  It turns out that to pay for the Affordable Care Act, a very progressive tax was put in place, and it does provide benefits for those who are uninsured, the Medicaid population across the Nation, as well as providing the buy-down of the insurance policies that are available through the various exchanges.  Keep in mind, when people talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act taxes, what they are talking about is a massive redistribution of wealth in this Nation and a furtherance of this income inequality that has been such a problem in our society and in our economy.  So the repeal of the Affordable Care Act does many, many things, most of which would be quite a problem for working men and women, for the seniors, for the elderly.  I didn't mention here that a good portion of that Medicaid population goes to provide long-term care in nursing homes for seniors who are not wealthy. I don't have the exact percentage, but some people say it is 50, 60 percent of Medicaid benefits across the Nation wind up providing services in the long-term care facilities.  Is that important to seniors? Oh, yeah.  Is it important for children of seniors, you know, those people that are in their forties and fifties whose parents are in their seventies and eighties? They are deeply concerned about this particular issue of the Medicaid expansion being eliminated by a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and then they wind up in a situation of having to take care of Mom and Dad, trying to figure out how to do it on their insufficient income.  So we need to understand that the very first act undertaken by the President was to set in motion a very serious rejiggering, a reoperation of the entire healthcare system in this Nation, so much so that the standard insurance companies that provide policies to the great majority of Americans are going: Whoa, wait a minute. You eliminate the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, and we don't know how to price in the marketplace for the coming year.  Right now, those insurance companies are in the process of figuring out what their policies are going to be, how they would price them.  One of the things the Affordable Care Act does is to provide an opportunity for those that have preexisting conditions, serious healthcare problems, for those people to be able to get insurance; therefore, the risk is spread. Now, if the Affordable Care Act disappears, would this be part of the replacement? We don't know.  Our colleagues on the Republican side keep talking about repeal and replace. We don't have a replacement plan yet, but what we do have is a probability of a massive tax cut for the very wealthy. We are also looking at chaos in the insurance system.  So let's be aware of what is going on in Washington when we talk about repeal and replace and when you talk about ObamaCare--which, by the way, is also known as the Affordable Care  I have, today, some of my colleagues joining us.

I doubt that I will take all that time, unless my colleague from Iowa wants to engage in a colloquy about some issues of the day which we might find a very exciting and interesting thing to do, Mr.I see you await your turn here.  Over the last week, Congress--the last 2 weeks now, 3 almost--has enacted a series of repeals of regulations that had been passed in the Obama administration. On the floor today, not more than an hour and a half ago, three additional repeals of regulations took place. These were under the Congressional Review Act, a law that is some 25 years old now that allows the Congress to literally repeal regulations that are out there.  I will give you a couple of examples. Today, one of them dealt with the planning process for the Bureau of Land About a quarter of a million acres of land are under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land This is public land. It belongs to all of us. This land is your land. Well, this is the land that belongs to the American people. The repeal today of a new public review process on land planning is--I don't understand it. I was once deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior, and I oversaw the Bureau of Land I was operating under the law that was old in the 1990s.  But here we are with this repeal of a new process, a process that actually invited into the land planning for the Bureau of Land Management where are the roads going to go, how are they going to manage the various uses of the land, whether it is agriculture, for cattle, or for recreation, or hunting, whatever, that they invite into that process all of the local agencies. The county, the State, environmental groups, hunting, fishing, cattlemen, agricultural groups, whoever would have a stake in that, they were invited into the process. It shortened the process from 8 years down to something probably in the 2-or 3-year range to go through this entire thing, and, for reasons that I will never understand, the repeal eliminated the use of good science and economics.  So I don't understand what is going on here. This is a good process so that the public would be invited. Yet, the Congressional Review Act--should the Senate agree and the President sign this particular review--the Bureau of Land Management will never be able to go back and enter this process of land planning again.                              {time}  1800  They cannot issue a new regulation. What is happening here is nonsense. There is mountaintop removal in coal country, where mountains are simply wiped off the face of the Earth and all of that dirt is piled into the nearby streams. We have that regulation.  Providing clean water for the communities and the rivers for recreation or fishing or any other thing is gone and no longer available to protect the communities. It goes on and on.  I know one thing that the President did the very first day was an executive order to eliminate the reduction in the mortgage guarantee fee. This is a fee paid by homeowners--usually low-income homeowners--who, because of their income, because of their financial status, cannot get a regular mortgage unless there is a guarantee. He said this was for the benefit of the homeowner. This was for the benefit of the bankers.  We already know that he has appointed three people to his cabinet that are from Wall Street, particularly from Goldman Sachs, and another one from another agency on Wall He was going to do away with Wall No, he brought Wall Street into the cabinet. We are going backwards on this.

It is a small amount, but it is an additional $500 a year that an individual would have to pay, assuming they had to have a mortgage guarantee.

First of all, let's remember that the Congressional Review Act being used to repeal these regulations has two parts to it. One, it has the ability of Congress to repeal regulations, which I think is a good idea. The second part of it, I think, has some real shortcomings. And that is, once that regulation has been repealed, both Houses vote before the President signs it, then the issue cannot be revisited by that administrative agency.  I gave the example of the BLM, but it applies across the board. Regulations that deal with smoking on airplanes is a regulation. If we repeal that regulation, suddenly there is smoking on airplanes.

We will never know now because the Congress has passed a regulation that required oil and gas companies to disclose any fees, any money that they have paid to a foreign government for the opportunity to extract oil or gas from their country.  We happen to know that many of the countries in which these American oil and gas companies operate are rife with corruption. So this is a way for us to do an anticorruption program around the world that involves our national oil companies. That is on the way to being repealed.  How about mentally ill people being able to get a firearm?  I suspect 80 percent of Americans--maybe 100 percent--think that somebody who is seriously mentally ill ought not to be able to get a firearm.  Well, there is a mechanism. It is a national database. We call it the NICS database. It is a database that gun shops have to inquire if an individual is on that database for domestic violence, criminal activity, or for mental illness.  We have had a problem with the mental illness part of this because many mentally ill people do not get on the database for a variety of reasons. The counties, cities, States don't provide that information. In some cases, it is deemed to be proprietary or confidential.  But there is a way. It exists in the regulations today that would require the Social Security Administration--when it makes a payment for disability for severe mental illness to an individual, that individual's name goes on this database. When that individual may want to go down to the gun shop and buy a weapon, the gun shop would query the database and, lo and behold, the individual comes up and he won't able to get a gun.  It makes sense. It enhances the database. It adds to the database individuals that are so severely mentally ill that they are able to get Social Security disability payments.  Who is to object to that?  Well, apparently a majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate does object to that. Probably the National Rifle Association also. So now we have a situation in which we have a protection for Americans being protected from the mentally ill individual that could not buy a gun now suddenly being able to not be on the national database for those people that are mentally ill. One more protection is gone.  There are others, and I am going to run through them as quickly as I can here.  I don't know whether you believe in climate change, global warming. I certainly do. I have worked on this for[[Page H1064]]more than 30 years now, and it is a real issue. We know--there is no debate about this--that methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. In fact, it is far more powerful than carbon dioxide.  So the emissions of methane are one of the things that we would want to reduce going into the atmosphere to add to those elements in the atmosphere that creates global warming, climate change.  Well, the House of Representatives has passed a resolution through the law that allows it to do so--to roll back a requirement that the Bureau of Land Management put in place that requires oil and gas companies that are drilling for oil, drilling for natural gas, to control the leakage of methane from the gas well.  Wow, that is a terrible thing to do. Really? To require that an oil company, a drilling company that is going after natural gas on government--excuse me, your land, the American public's land--that they, in the process of drilling for that natural gas or oil, control, capture the methane that would otherwise leak from that well?  Well, that regulation is gone. The protections of Americans are gone. Greenhouse gas emissions are emitted without regulatory control. Many of these gas wells are in communities and in neighborhoods that will also enjoy more methane emissions.                              {time}  1815  One more--or maybe more. Oh, yes, labor violations. Labor laws have been on the books for well over 80 years. The labor laws are health and safety, worker safety, requirements on hours, working conditions, hazardous circumstances. There are many different regulations that affect employers. They have to provide a safe working environment for their workers. Some do. Well, I would say most work at making sure that their workplace is safe. Some do not. Some of those who do not provide a safe workplace have been fined by the Federal Government for those labor violations. It is a good thing. It causes those companies to provide a safe working environment for their employees.  A regulation was put forward by the Obama administration that said that if a company wants to contract with the Federal Government, they must disclose their labor violations, where they have violated the various labor laws. It may be hours of work, overtime pay, working conditions, hazardous circumstances, safety. They would have to disclose it. It didn't say they couldn't get a contract, but it did say that they would have to disclose to the public that they have not provided sufficient awareness of the various labor safety and workplace laws. That is on the way to being repealed.  What I want to do tonight is to simply say to the American public: Pay attention. There are many things going on here in Congress and in the administration that are harmful to you, the American public. The kind of protections that you have counted on--worker safety, environmental protections if you live downstream from a coal mining operation, any of those things--are in the process of being repealed, and your protections along with them. So be aware of what the new administration and the Congress is doing to you, not for you.  I could talk about the wall and about the $15 billion to $30 billion that is going to be spent if Mr.Trump gets his way here and builds a 1,400-mile wall. I want to just end with this, and that is choices. Your representatives, myself, 434 of my colleagues here and 100 Senators and a President, we make choices about how your tax money is going to be spent.  Should it be spent on a wall?  Well, let's consider for a moment spending it on a wall. This is $15 billion, the minimum amount of money, and it is not going to build much of the wall. But for $15 billion, what could you do for it?  I am from I was once a regent of the University of California and on the board for the California State University, so I am familiar with this system. $15 billion could fund the entire California State University system for 3 years, and that is nearly a half a million students. You could replace all of the water pipes in Flint, Michigan, 270 times over for $15 billion.  Do you want safe drinking water in Flint and other communities around the United States or do you want a wall? Are you concerned about the American military, the Navy, five Virginia-class submarines, or one Ford-class aircraft carrier plus a submarine? Or how about scholarships for undergraduate programs at the University of California, which I had the privilege of graduating from a few years ago?  27,777 4-year, full-time scholarships. That is the undergraduate population at the University of California Davis, which I have the privilege of representing.  There is one more place you could spend $15 billion or even one part of $15 billion, and it is on this. These are the deadly diseases in Let's see. Breast cancer, over the last decade we have seen breast cancer actually decline. Prostate cancer has declined by 11 percent, heart disease by 14 percent, stroke by 23 percent, HIV/AIDS by 52 percent. Alzheimer's has not declined. It has increased by 471 percent, and it is going to go even more.  What could we do with $15 billion of research on a disease that affects every American family?  We could almost assuredly find a cure for Alzheimer's. I thank my colleagues here in the House of Representatives for increasing the budget for Alzheimer's research from around $500 million to just under $1 billion. That was done last year. If we can increase that funding another $1 billion a year, the researchers indicate to us that we have a high probability of delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years. With another $1 billion after that, we probably could find a cure for this disease that is going to bust the American bank. Medicare and Medicaid, that is where the big money is going to be spent.  So my plea to our President and those who want to build a wall is: We have choices. You want to do something for the American public? Let's spend that $15 billion to $30 billion on education. You want to do something for every American family? Spend some portion of that $15 billion to $30 billion by doubling the amount of money that we are spending annually on Alzheimer's research. You want to do something for the security of our Nation? Meet those critical needs that our military has. Whether it is a new submarine or an aircraft carrier we can debate, but we do know that we have expenditures that are necessary in that area.  So, Mr.President, don't waste our money. Don't waste our tax money on a wall. By the way, we know Mexico is not going to pay for it. Don't get in a fight with our trading partner and our neighbors to the south and  Be aware, Watch closely to what is happening here in If you are concerned, so am I concerned about where we are headed and about what this government is doing to you, not for you, but rather to you.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1059-3.txt,1973,OBAMACARE,2017.0,7.0,January
9907,topic-id,586,"Mr.Speaker, in 1947, Senator Arthur Vandenberg famously stated that politics stop at the water's edge. What that meant was that partisan fighting and attacks should cease when they compromise America's role in missions abroad and, indeed, when they compromise the safety and security of Americans abroad as well.  Yesterday, Mr.Speaker, I sat in the Homeland Security Committee and heard over two dozen references from my esteemed colleagues across the aisle to a Muslim ban. When President Obama expanded its own screening for refugees for majority Muslim nations, he said it was because of ``the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters,'' and nary a peep was heard.  Our colleagues across the aisle said this Muslim ban will endanger Americans and serve as a recruiting tool to Mr.Speaker, I agree, except there is no Muslim ban.  Talk of a Muslim ban makes Americans less safe at home, true; it makes Americans less safe abroad, true; and if politics stop at the water's edge and there is no Muslim ban, then why use partisan politics to perpetrate falsehoods that do just those very things.  Let's look at the facts:  Of the 2.3 billion Muslims on the planet Earth, 11 percent live in the countries named in Mr.Trump's executive order. Nine-tenths of 1 percent live in Syria, a single nation pulled out for heightened scrutiny.  The duration of the heightened scrutiny held to the Syrian refugee population is one-half that of the same action taken by Mr.Trump's predecessor, President Obama, as it related to Iraqis in 2011 when nary a peep was heard because politics are supposed to stop at the water's edge.  We hear questions: Does the President have a constitutional right to do this? I say, no, he has a constitutional duty to do this.  We look at Article II and see the clear and present danger clause. We hear the language of the Obama administration speaking of growing terrorist threats from abroad. We see in Article II and in the oath that the President takes that it is his duty to protect Americans from all threats, all enemies, foreign and domestic.  So what we know is that the executive order affects a scant 7 of well over 50 majority-Muslim nations. There is no religious test because it also affects millions of Christians living in these nations. It affects about 11 percent of the global Muslim population. There are exceptions granted.  We know that ISIS is using the refugee system to infiltrate Western nations. We know that first- or second-generation radical Islamists have killed over 70 Americans since Boston and wounded over 300 on U.soil.[[Page H883]]                                {time}  1015  We know that, just over a month ago, a dozen innocent individuals at a Christmas market in Berlin were murdered and 50 more were injured by a refugee. We know that the fallacious concept of a Muslim ban inflames and enrages our enemies and serves as a recruiting tool.  So the question then becomes: Why do some Members of this esteemed body continue to perpetuate what is willful ignorance at best and a falsehood at worst? Why say there is a Muslim ban when there is not?  Mr.Speaker, if politics stop at the water's edge, then Members won't play loose with the facts to score political points. Members won't advance a false narrative that endangers Members will support this President, as they did the last President, as he seeks to discharge his duty to defend the United States, its citizens, and our Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH882-2.txt,1737,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,2.0,February

9894,topic-id,1460,"Mr.Speaker, I am so grateful that Representative Chris Smith is a Member of the United States Congress because of his leadership, because of his enormous heart, and his enormous caring.  It is amazing--those of us who believe in God--the way our lives develop. I was a guy that grew up; I never liked to hug anybody. But when we had three beautiful incredible girls added to my wife's and my life, I became a hugger. Fox has a show named ``Outnumbered,'' but that has been my life for years now.  I know there are so many people that say you are a man and you have no right to speak about this. I guess, when I was a judge, there were those who thought, since I was not a person that had been on both sides of a civil lawsuit or had been a defendant in a case, maybe I should not be able to say anything about or pass sentence. But we have laws, and laws are there to protect people.  I do believe, as our Founders did, in nature's God, that we have a Creator who provided us inalienable rights. But in this world, you have to fight for any inheritance, including your inalienable rights.  It does appear that nature gave a greater percentage of women a nurturing greater sense of loving and caring than most men. That gets changed for some of us when you have a house full of girls.                              {time}  1800  But I could identify with the doctor who had performed, I think he said, over 1,000 abortions, who came before our Judiciary Committee and testified about how it was just a procedure, how it was nothing to him, and how he would go into the uterus.  Of course, the pregnant mom was not dilated and not going to be able to deliver a baby that had begun forming, had a heartbeat. But that is why he would go in with his instrument, feel around with his clamps for something that felt long, and when he found it, he knew that it was either a leg or an arm, and he would grab it and pull it out from the baby's body, and continue till he did that four times, and then reach in and find something that felt bulbous, and he would--he knew the head could not come out in a bulbous form, and so he would crush it and pull out the baby's head. And that was the way he went about beginning the abortion of a child that had begun developing like that.  He never thought a thing about it until his daughter died, and then he became nauseated, and he was never able to do another abortion like that, and it became such a burden that he had done what he had done.  I know from my years on the bench as a judge, I know from my years as an attorney helping people, if something is built on a lie, the chances are that the outcome will not be good for a majority of people. I also know that if someone encourages and perpetuates a lie within some other person's life, they are not that person's friend.  So I would like to quickly reference an article published by WND called ``The Real `Jane Roe' '' and just hit some of the highlights about the real Jane Roe, the woman.  I was talking with my friend, Chris Smith, about Norma He is quite familiar with her, and I believe he said he had talked to her and had come to know her. Being the Christian that Chris Smith is, he cares deeply about people, and that included Norma  But this article says: ``At the age of 21, McCorvey was pregnant with her third child. She had given her other two children up for adoption and McCorvey did not want to say good-bye to her offspring a third time. So she decided to have an illegal abortion, but the Dallas clinic she went to had been recently raided and shut down. So McCorvey made up a story--she had been raped, she told her doctor and two lawyers. She signed an affidavit on condition of anonymity, and the lawsuit began.''  And she told WorldNetDaily: `` `I considered abortion and, because of this, I was put in touch with two attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda They had just recently graduated from law school and were interested in challenging the Texas abortion statute.' ''  She says: `` `Plain and simple, I was used.' '' This is Norma `` `I was a nobody to them. They only needed a pregnant woman to use for their case, and that's it. They cared, not about me, but only about legalizing abortion. Even after the case, I was never respected--probably because I was not an ivy-league educated, liberal feminist like they were.' ''  But she goes on and says--well, this was from a New York Times interview: ``McCorvey describes her meeting the two young attorneys. . . .  `` `Sarah Weddington sat right across the table from me at Columbo's pizza parlor, and I didn't know then that she had had an abortion herself. When I told her then how desperately I needed one, she could have told me where to go for it. But she wouldn't because she needed me to be pregnant for her case. I set Sarah Weddington up on a pedestal like a rose petal. But when it came to my turn, well, Sarah saw these cuts on my wrists, my swollen eyes from crying, the miserable person sitting across from her, and she knew she had a patsy. She knew I wouldn't go outside of the realm of her and I was too scared. It was one of the most hideous times of my life.' ''  She says: `` `My experience with pro-abortion leaders is that they are snobs. They claim they care about women and their rights but, in my experience, they care for nothing, not even themselves in a way,' '' McCorvey said.  ``McCorvey said in a 1990 New York Times interview that the rape lie caused her to be `terribly depressed.' ''  `` `I was brought up not to lie and, because of this story, I had to lie all the time. And the depression periods got deeper and longer until the night I cut my wrists.' ''  Well, it is one of the difficulties that attorneys have: when you represent someone and you are sworn to do the best job you can, it should be more than simply about getting the legal result that a lawyer wants. It ought to be about helping the client. You can't always do that.  But it is rather tragic that Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, now looks back on that as the most hideous time of her life, and that she was taken advantage of by people that didn't care about her. They had an agenda.  I heard someone here on the floor talking about the Women's March and how that was for all women, except the hypocrisy of that march was it was not about all women because there were pro-life women that tried to march. It was about women that think exactly like they do, and nobody else gets to participate.  It is the same kind of mentality that would--when in the majority here in this body say: We want everybody to participate in debate, except we are[[Page H672]]going to have a record-setting number of closed rules so nobody can debate. We don't want your input on We don't care that you support what we do on preexisting conditions and on kids living with their parents.  Heck, some of us said 30 would be a better number than 26. They didn't care. They could pass it without our votes. They didn't want our input.  So then to hear people who treated us like that say we care about open debate, knowing that some of those same people came down here and grabbed microphones and, for the first time we can find in congressional hearing, prevented the majority from starting into session; and then they want to lecture us on openness and kindness and open debate? Really?  Let's go back to the Norma McCorveys of the world. Let's minister to them individually, as my church, as a number of ministries with which I am greatly familiar do. Let's help the real person. Let's help that child so that that little boy or that little girl doesn't have its arms and legs jerked out of the uterus. Let's help that child have a life that will be so full they will never think about slitting their wrists, as Norma McCorvey did. Let's vote for life.

9788,topic-id,608,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In 2008, our economy suffered one of the most significant financial crises in history. In the midst of the crisis and in response to a fear that some financial firms' failures could cause severe harm to the overall economy, the Federal Government provided extraordinary taxpayer-funded assistance in order to prevent certain financial firms' failures.  In the ensuing years, experts from the financial, regulatory, legal, and academic communities have examined how best to prevent another similar crisis from occurring and to eliminate the possibility of using taxpayer moneys to bail out failing firms.  The Judiciary Committee has advanced the review of this issue with the aim of crafting a solution that will better equip our bankruptcy laws to resolve failing firms, while also encouraging greater private counterparty diligence in order to reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis.  Among others things, this effort responded to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that called for an examination of how to improve the Bankruptcy Code in this area.  During the past two Congresses, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act, legislation that improved the Bankruptcy Code to better facilitate the resolution of financial firms.  That legislation was the culmination of a bipartisan process that solicited and incorporated the views of a wide range of leading experts and relevant regulators. In both instances, the bill passed the House by a voice vote under suspension of the rules.  This Congress, Chairman Marino of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law introduced the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act as H.1667. Following its introduction, the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law conducted a hearing on the bill. H.1667 is identical to previous legislation, with one minor change to refine the director liability protection provision. Last week, the Judiciary Committee approved the legislation by a unanimous voice vote.  The bill before us today is the product of a careful, deliberate, and thorough process, and reflects a diverse range of views from a variety of interested parties.  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act makes several improvements to the Bankruptcy Code in order to enhance the prospect of an efficient resolution of a financial firm through the bankruptcy process.  The bill allows for a speedy transfer of the operating assets of a financial firm over the course of a weekend. This quick transfer allows the financial firm to continue to operate in the normal course, which preserves the value of the enterprise for the creditors of the bankruptcy without a significant impact on the firm's employees, suppliers, and customers.  The bill also requires expedited judicial review by a bankruptcy judge randomly chosen from a pool of judges designated in advance and selected by the Chief Justice for their experience, expertise, and willingness to preside over these complex cases. Furthermore, the legislation provides for key regulatory input throughout the process.  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is a bipartisan, balanced approach that increases transparency and[[Page H2719]]predictability in the resolution of a financial firm. Furthermore, it ensures that shareholders and creditors, not taxpayers, bear the losses related to the failure of a financial company.  I would like to thank Chairman Marino, who chaired the hearing on this legislation and who is the lead sponsor of the bill. I am also pleased that Ranking Member Conyers and Subcommittee Ranking Member Cicilline joined in introducing this important legislation. I want to thank them and their staff for their efforts in developing this bill.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

9961,topic-id,575,"Mr.President, before we vote on the resolution of disapproval, I want to reiterate several very important facts.  This resolution of disapproval is bipartisan. The resolution is also supported by 23 groups, mostly disability rights groups.  The disability groups believe that this agency--the Social Security Administration--and its regulation will unfairly stigmatize those with disabilities. Of course, they are right.  The American Civil Liberties Union has said this:       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should      not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection      between the need for a representative payee to manage one's      Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward      gun violence.  The ACLU goes on to say:       Here, the rule automatically conflates one's disability-     related characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money,      with the inability to safely possess a firearm.  The agency regulation is defective in many ways. Namely, the regulation does not require the agency to prove a person is dangerous or mentally ill. The regulation also provides no formal hearing or due process before a person is reported to the gun ban list.  Supporters of the gun ban have said that repeal of this regulation will interfere with the enforcement of the gun prohibition laws. I want to say plainly and simply: This is hogwash. We should not let baseless scare tactics confuse this important issue.  Important Federal gun laws are still on the books, even if the agency rule is repealed. We aren't repealing any laws.  The new regulation is inconsistent with these existing Federal gun laws.  The agency still has a duty to report anyone who has actually been adjudicated as dangerously mentally ill to the gun ban list. That is also true of anyone convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence or involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  The Federal law requires this:       If a Federal department or agency . . . has any record of      any person demonstrating that the person falls within one of      the categories . . . shall . . . provide the pertinent      information contained in such record to the Attorney  This law remains in effect.  Repealing this regulation will merely ensure that disabled citizens' Second Amendment rights are, in fact, protected.  Those rights will no longer be able to be revoked without a hearing and without due process. It will take more than a personal opinion--just a personal opinion of a bureaucrat--to abridge one's Second Amendment rights.  An existing statute requires agencies to report the individuals to the gun ban list who are ineligible to possess firearms. That requirement remains intact even if this regulation is repealed.  So it is plainly wrong to claim, as has been said, that if the regulation is disapproved, agencies will no longer have to report prohibited persons.  If the supporters of this regulation want to take away people's gun rights, then they need to acknowledge the government must carry the burden to actually prove a person--prove a person--is dangerously mentally ill. And the government must provide due process in that process.  They need to go back to the drawing board, in other words, because this rule is inconsistent with the very important Second Amendment rights to bear arms, own, and possess guns--buy and possess guns. Therefore, it must be repealed, and this resolution must be approved.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1167-2.txt,457,BOOSTING RATES OF AMERICAN VETERAN EMPLOYMENT ACT,2017.0,15.0,April

10056,topic-id,1371,"Mr.President, I am here tonight to join my colleague the senior Senator from New Mexico and all my other colleagues on the Senate floor to stand up for hundreds of thousands of my constituents in New Mexico who will lose their health care coverage if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw our Nation's health care system into chaos.  It is absolutely criminal for Republicans to strip millions of their health care without even a conceptual replacement plan in place. To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I want to make it clear that ``we will fix it later'' simply doesn't cut it.  They promised repeal and replace, and now they are giving us repeal and run, and that will cause chaos in our health care system. In my home State of New Mexico, according to the Urban Institute, an estimated 266,000 people will lose their health care coverage. This is not a change to their plan or a different premium. They will lose their coverage in its entirety. Thousands more of our State's 2 million residents will lose access to birth control and other preventive services and Medicare prescription drug coverage. Nearly everyone will be subjected to higher costs for lower quality insurance, especially those with preexisting conditions. Dismantling our health care system would also put at risk many of the gains we made in protecting the 860,000 New Mexicans who have preexisting conditions like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. These individuals will be forced to pay more for their health care coverage and possibly lose access altogether.  This is not a game; this is a matter of life and death. Without any plan in place, this repeal and run maneuver will cause health care costs for all Americans to skyrocket. Dismantling our health care system literally means taking hundreds of dollars each month away from hard-working families. In my book, that is highway robbery. How? It is simple. This reckless Republican repeal and run will strip away the tax credits that help many working Americans afford their premiums. More than 32,000 New Mexicans rely on those tax credits, which average about $200 a month--well over half of their monthly premium for health care coverage. Many of the sickest, oldest, and the poorest of our neighbors and family members will lose their health care coverage altogether.  Over 20,000 New Mexican seniors will be forced to pay $1,000 more per year for their prescription drugs. Fixed income seniors can't afford to pay more for prescription drugs.  Dismantling our health care system is particularly problematic in our Nation's rural areas, including much of the State of New Last fall I went on a multiday rural health care listening tour across communities throughout Northeastern New Rural hospitals like those in Raton, Clayton, and Santa Rosa are often the only health care providers for hundreds of miles in any direction. Under the Affordable Care Act, rural hospitals agree to exchange higher rates of insurance coverage for their patients for a reduction in reimbursement rates. In other words, they aren't being paid as much per patient as they once were, but the number of patients who come in without any insurance is dramatically lower. Now Republicans are going to take away coverage from a quarter million New Mexicans, but they aren't going to give rural hospitals their higher reimbursement premiums back. This repeal and run maneuver will cause many rural hospitals that already are operating on the margins to shut their doors or to simply turn away sick patients.  Nationwide, nearly 700 local hospitals in rural communities face the risk of imminent closure. Think about that. That is nearly one-third of the Nation's hospitals. Almost all of them would be forced to turn away patients if the Republicans move forward in dismantling our Nation's health care system. In New Mexico, that would mean forcing many of my constituents to drive for hours to access critical lifesaving care. It would also shake our State's economy to its core.  Health care jobs were one of the few economic bright spots in New Mexico over the past 6 years, particularly in rural communities, but this reckless plan--or I should say lack of one, to be accurate--throws our Nation's health care system into chaos and scars New Mexico's rural communities for years to come. A community whose hospital shuts down may never recover. That is what is at stake here. Denying a family health care, denying a whole community health care is reckless and immoral.  You might hear Republicans say they want to tear everything apart now, but we shouldn't worry because they will fix it later. Let me be clear: We have the capacity to fix and improve our current health care system in a bipartisan way without throwing it all into chaos, but Republicans have to make that choice before it is too late. I would welcome honest attempts to find ways to improve our Nation's health care laws, to make them work better for all  In the past, I have taken the lead on commonsense fixes to our Nation's health care policies. In 2010, in the House of Representatives, I led the fight to extend coverage to the children of military families covered by TRICARE up until the time they are 26 years old. After hearing from many small businesses in New Mexico, I fought to repeal unnecessary 1099 tax reporting requirements for small businesses. To this day, I continue to work with Republicans like Dean Heller of Nevada to eliminate the so-called Cadillac tax that would place an incredibly unfair tax burden on employer-provided health insurance that many working families rely on.  Republicans need to put partisan politics aside and remember why Congress passed the ACA in the first place: To expand access to quality health care for all Before we passed health care reform, New Mexico had the second highest rate of uninsured citizens in the entire  I have heard from a lot of New Mexicans who have told me how access to health care coverage has impacted their lives, even saved their lives. I would like to tell you just one story of one of those New  Karen from Santa Fe is a registered nurse, and she is a breast cancer survivor. As a nurse, Karen has seen how health care reform and the reduction of uninsured and uncompensated care has helped community hospitals better serve their patients. But the real impact of health care reform for Karen has been personal. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, Karen's insurance company dropped her coverage. When she had to pay out of pocket for her coverage, her costs doubled. As she went through several more recurrences of cancer, Karen went bankrupt. She lost her home.  In a letter to me, she said: ``Cancer is hard enough, but not to be able to afford my co-pays and appointments caused me so much stress it made me more vulnerable for complications.''  Today, Karen is able to afford health care coverage even with her preexisting condition. But Republicans are threatening to take that all away from her and from hundreds of millions of other  Karen went on to say in her letter:       No one should go without health care because of income.      Good health is not a privilege for a wealthy few, but a human      right.[[Page S148]]  It is hard to say it any better than that. No American has sent their elected representative to Washington to score political points and threaten the health and finances of hard-working Republicans need to realize that is exactly what they are doing. What they are doing means chaos. It means less health care. It is that simple.

In the spring, Friday can find us catching a baseball game, the American pastime.  Mr.Speaker, last Friday night, I was in Cairo, Egypt, and what I saw was that same joyous, happy experience of families sharing their successes of the week; celebrating a great soccer victory; clapping to wonderful, warm local music; and witnessing the squealing of their kids running around their parents, celebrating a birthday or just a good week at work or school.  The streets of the Khan el-Khalili Bazaar in Cairo were chock-full last Friday, Mr.Speaker, with the living and the loving, just going about that weekly experience pursuing their own version of happiness and  Friday night in Cairo, the land of the Pharaoh, the land of the beginning of much of human education and civilization, there was dining and bargaining in the bizarre that has been the centerpiece of trading and manufacturing and merchandising for half a millennia.  Mr.Speaker, my trip to Egypt was marked not just with witnessing the joy of Egyptian family life and seeing and sharing what we have in common. It was a reminder that the 91 million Egyptians are on the front line of the global war on terror, a war that unites the leadership of Egypt and the United States arm-in-arm to design and implement the most effective strategies we can to defeat the malevolent evil enemy of ISIS, al-Qaida, Boko Haram, and their bloody cohorts across the globe.  In my view, after the approach of the past 8 years, our enemies are stronger and engaged more broadly than ever before. Nothing has driven this point home more than a visit in Cairo to the Peter and Paul's Coptic  Located on the plaza adjacent to the offices of His Holiness Coptic Pope Tawadros II, there was joy there last Saturday morning, Mr.Speaker, listening to the chants of the priests, the reverence of the families in the pews, the kids again squealing and smiling in their parents' arms.  But, Mr.Speaker, on the periphery of that joy was a stark reminder of the destruction there on December 11, when a male ISIS jihadist suicide bomber entered that church disguised as a woman and detonated his vest, murdering 25, mostly women, splattering the walls and the floors of God's House with their blood.  As I walked through that same entrance last Saturday, Mr.Speaker, the church has developed a reverent shrine to those who were lost.

Best summarized by the wise Pope of the Coptic church--Mr.Speaker, we have to remind ourselves that the word ``Coptic,'' of course, comes from the Greek word ``aigyptios,'' which means The Coptic church is as old as Mark's arrival in Alexandria in the first century.  That wise old Pope told us, and I think really, Mr.Speaker, captured the whole spirit of the Egyptian people and the resolve that is taking place in that country under President el-Sisi when he said, Egyptians take two things from the Nile River on which they have lived some 5,000 years. They take water, and they take moderation in their beliefs.  Mr.Speaker, tonight I wanted to come to the House Chamber and pay tribute to the Egyptian people for being on those front lines in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism, pay tribute to the Christian and Muslim people of Egypt working together to defeat this ideology. I want to commend President el-Sisi for his courageous leadership in the Muslim world.[[Page H1296]]  Coinciding with the birthday celebration of the Prophet Muhammad on New Year's Day 2015, President el-Sisi went to the Islamic world's most respected institution, Al-Azhar University, and called upon the world's 1.6 billion faithful Muslims and the faith's imams to support a religious revolution. He called on the leaders to reject the mindset of death and jihad.  Mr.Speaker, in both Egypt and America, we come from dust and to dust we shall return. We are made in God's image, and God has granted us such unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While we are breathing, each of us has an obligation to serve our fellow man, work to value our societies and make them the best that they can be.  In January, we witnessed a change in leadership here in the United We had a former President who grew up in Hawaii and grew up riding the waves in He rode a wave into the White House and then drifted along, bobbing on top of those waves for 8 years. Now, Mr.Speaker, we have a President in the White House who is not riding the waves; he is making waves. It is my hope that he will execute a new direction and take new actions to win the global war on terrorism.  I have to say, Mr.Speaker, whether it takes 3 months or 30 years, I won't rest until we unify the civilized world to reject jihad, reject the terror we saw at Peter and Paul's Church in Mr.Speaker, we need to condemn those who condone it. We need to condemn those who finance it. We need to reject it when we see it taught in the mosque. We need to reject it on We need to reject it in the media. We must condemn those who say it is wrong but stand silent.  Mr.Speaker, there are no bystanders in this fight, and there is no substitute for victory. Mr.Speaker, all across the world tonight, we Egyptians, we Americans, we want our Fridays back. TGIF, Mr.Speaker,  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1295.txt,2223,1415,2017.0,16.0,February

It is why we are fighting tooth and nail to prevent any cuts that would jeopardize these social safety net programs.  The Hirono-Donnelly amendment would prevent any partisan attempt to harm Medicare and Specifically, it would block congressional Republicans from using budget reconciliation to privatize Medicare or increase eligibility standards.

Today's action on H.66 and 67 illustrates this unfortunate reality.  Congressional Republicans once again are putting the financial industry ahead of average American workers. Their attempt to roll back President Obama's Department of Labor rules, which expanded working families' abilities to save their own retirement money through State- and large-city-administered retirement savings programs. The Republican proposal restricts saving options for working people.  For years, Republicans have hawked a false crisis about Social Security solvency; meanwhile, now they are proposing a very real retirement security crisis for America's seniors. We are nearing a boiling point. The difference between what average Americans have saved for retirement and where their savings should be is staggering: more than $6 trillion in shortfalls.  Roughly half of all U.families have no money set aside for retirement. Thirty-nine million Americans don't have access to a workplace retirement savings plan. Even Americans who work diligently to save for retirement are falling behind. With 10,000 American seniors reaching retirement age every day, enormous strain on the Federal budget is mounting to make up the difference.  Today most workers don't have a pension. Those that do, can't be so sure it will be there throughout their golden years. There has been a dramatic decline in guaranteed retirement benefits through employer support.  Without access to easy and affordable savings vehicles, far too many American workers will retire into poverty. This leads to overreliance on Social Security and other State and Federal assistance programs. It surely isn't the American  President Obama identified this crisis. He spoke to Congress about trying to work together to address it through bipartisan action, but our Republican colleagues said ``no.'' Their failure to act drove President Obama to coordinate with States, eight of which have already passed laws to create State-administered retirement programs for private sector workers, which H.66 and 67 would roll back.

The FCC's broadband privacy rule, a midnight regulation adopted by executive order in the waning days of the Obama administration, unnecessarily targets internet service providers and does very little to protect consumer privacy.  The rule adds costly and unnecessary innovation-stifling regulations to the internet and is another example of the Federal Government's picking winners and losers.  When passed, the FCC claimed that the rule would provide broadband customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and strong security protections for their personal information collected by internet service providers.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and want to address an issue created by the Federal Communication Commission's misguided privacy rule in a recent Ninth Circuit case.  For decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been the privacy cop on the beat for most industries, including the technology sector, protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Federal Trade Commission has brought over 500 privacy and data security cases to protect consumers. These include cases against internet service providers and some of the largest edge providers.  The Federal Communications Commission is a regulatory body focused on regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.  The Federal Trade Commission's work in privacy and data security has long been held up as a model by both parties, praising the agency for strong enforcement without overly burdensome regulations. During negotiations with the European Union to finalize the U.S.-European privacy shield, the Obama administration held up the Federal Trade Commission as the premier privacy enforcement agency.  Unfortunately, in a midnight action, the Federal Communications Commission jammed through its own privacy rule that is very different from the framework that the Federal Trade Commission has been enforcing for decades.  While we can reverse the poorly constructed FCC rule today, we must still address a recent court ruling. The Ninth Circuit recently ruled that the common carrier exemption in the Federal Trade Commission Act exempts an entity in its entirety from the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction if it engages in any common carrier activities, even if the company also engages in non-common carrier activity.  I have introduced legislation to address the court's ruling with the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Olson). It is my hope that our colleagues will join us.  S.34 makes clear that the Federal Trade Commission has authority over common carriers when they are acting outside the scope of the common carrier.

His compassion and leadership have contributed to a vibrant college campus and has inspired those beyond its borders. As a member of the Society of Saint Edmund, whose members founded the college in 1904, Father Ray has embodied a commitment to social justice throughout his lifetime of service.  Father Ray first came to Michael's as a 17-year-old freshman. He spent his college years as both a student and an athlete, gracing the baseball program with his talents as pitcher before graduating in 1951. Father[[Page S967]]Ray then served as a staff sergeant in the U.Marine Corps during the Korean conflict. It was there that Father Ray saw the importance of loyalty and strong leadership, leading him to join another brotherhood following his discharge.

He is, by all accounts, a much-loved and admired presence on      the campus.       ``What I look for in leadership is a good example,'' he      says, paraphrasing Francis: ``It's not so much what you      say as what you do.'' Father Ray can't help but point out      that in this election season these words took on special      meaning.       ``Great leaders think of the common good,'' he says. ``They      aren't in it just for themselves.'' Here at Saint Michael's,      he says, ``We are blessed with the opportunity to lead by      example.''       Father Ray believes that making people feel safe is an      important part of good leadership. He admires the leadership      of Pope Francis ``He is a man of action,'' Father Ray says,      recalling a time when Pope Francis embraced a man with a very      disfigured face. ``He didn't hesitate. This is an example of      actions being more important than words.''       Humility is another raw ingredient of leadership, and      Father Ray sees this quality on campus in many places,      including the leadership of President Jack ``He is      extremely humble--always stands in the back for group      photographs!''       Was the leadership Father Ray saw in the Marines different      from the leadership he has experienced in civilian life?      ``The training was strict,'' he says, ``but I might never      have become a priest if I hadn't had that opportunity to      think about things.

9791,topic-id,538,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and my current new ranking member, Mr.Cicilline, for their work on this important legislation. I further thank my colleague across the aisle, Congressman Schneider from Illinois, for helping us manage this.  This is a bipartisan bill that is better for having gone through the regular legislative order. It was a pleasure to work with such knowledgeable and professional colleagues.  In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection That legislation was intended to address, among other things, the potential failure of large financial institutions.  While the Dodd-Frank Act created a regulatory process for such an event, the act states that the preferred method of resolution for a financial institution is through the bankruptcy process.  However, the Dodd-Frank Act did not make any amendments to the Bankruptcy Code to account for the unique characteristics of a financial institution. The legislation before us today fills that void.  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is the product of years of study by industry, legal, and financial regulatory experts. It is also the result of bipartisan review over the course of four separate hearings before the Judiciary  The legislation includes several provisions that improve the ability of a financial institution to be resolved through the bankruptcy process. It allows for a speedy transfer of a financial firm's assets to a newly formed company. That company would continue the firm's operations for the benefit of its customers, employees, and creditors, and ensure the financial stability of the marketplace.  This quick transfer is overseen by and subject to the approval of an experienced bankruptcy judge, and includes due process protections for parties in interest.                              {time}  1330  The bill also creates an explicit role in the bankruptcy process for the key financial regulators. In addition, there are provisions that facilitate the transfer of derivative and similarly structured contracts to the newly formed company. This will improve the ability of the company to continue the financial institution's operations.  Finally, the legislation recognizes the factually and legally complicated questions presented by the resolution of a financial institution. To that end, the bill provides that specialized bankruptcy and appellate judges will be designated in advance to preside over these cases.  The bankruptcy process has long been favored as the primary mechanism for dealing with distressed and failing companies. This is due to its impartial nature, adherence to established precedent, judicial oversight, and grounding in the principles of due process and the rule of law. We are here today as part of an effort to structure a bankruptcy process that is better equipped to deal with the specific issues raised by failing financial firms.  I want to stress again the bipartisan support that went through this process--at the subcommittee level and at the full Committee on the Judiciary level chaired by Chairman Goodlatte, my colleague on the other side of the aisle who is helping us manage this and the individuals in this House who realized what had to be done to protect the law abiding citizens of this country from a financial disaster.

It is something that is completely and totally detached from the reality of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, as they have in fact already positively affected tens of millions of families inside the United  This week we are about to have an incredible battle waged against the Affordable Care Understand this, right in the crosshairs are the hospitals of our country, not just the famous, big hospitals we all know the names of but Catholic hospitals across our country, hospitals that provide the service for people now under a much more orderly system than they would have done if we had never put the Affordable Care Act on the books in the first place.  At the forefront of all these issues, though, is this largest of all public health epidemics that has ever faced the country, the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic, like OxyContin, which is claiming the lives of more than 90 people every single day across this country. In Massachusetts alone, when all the final numbers have been gathered, 2,000 people will have died in the State of Massachusetts in the year 2016, and 1,500 of them will have been found to have had fentanyl in their blood system. This is an epidemic of unbelievable proportions. Fentanyl is the Godzilla of opioids. It is powerful and deadly and knocking people down the streets all over Massachusetts, all over New England, and all over our country. People are being robbed of their potential and God-given abilities from this epidemic that knows no socioeconomic, ethnic, or political boundaries, and Congress has recognized the importance of tackling the Tsunami of heroin and prescription opioid addiction that is laying waste to these communities.  Just 1 month ago, on the Senate floor, Republicans and Democrats came together and passed a bill to provide $1 billion in new resources to States to address the opioid crisis, resources that can be and are being dedicated to increasing access to treatment for opioid use disorders. Yet, today, pending before the Senate is a Republican budget whose entire premise is to repeal coverage for the exact same vulnerable people who need access to treatment. Not only is that nonsensical, it is downright cruel for all those families and individuals who finally felt a sense of hope, the hope that new resources could mean the difference between life and death for their loved ones. If you kicked this policy in the heart, you would break your toe. That is how heartless it is going to be in terms of its impact upon ordinary families. With this budget, Republicans are repealing the hope that has given families a reason to ensure that they will have the coverage. This is going to make the problem even worse.  Medicaid pays $1 out of every $5 for substance use disorder treatment in the United Without Federal investment in the Medicaid program, States like Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, which are bearing the brunt of the opioid epidemic today, will have to find even more money in their already dwindling State budgets to aid those who need treatment. We all know what happens in this scenario when States cannot find that money. The most vulnerable among us, the ones who don't have a voice, are the ones who will suffer the most.  The repeal of Medicaid expansion would rip coverage from an estimated 1.6 million newly insured individuals with substance use disorders. At the same time, repeal will put big insurance companies back in charge. If the Republicans have their way, insurance companies would be able to discriminate against people, including individuals with a preexisting condition like an addiction disorder. OxyContin, heroin, fentanyl coverage--gone under the proposal the Republicans are making on the Senate floor this week.  Let's recognize that the Republicans are not just repealing ObamaCare; they are repealing hope. Those suffering from addiction don't have time for Republicans to come up--possibly, maybe, potentially soon, sometime, in the indefinite future--with a replacement plan.  There are 1.6 million people who have insurance for substance disorders right now for heroin, for OxyContin, for fentanyl. These are the people who could potentially die because they don't have medical coverage. What is the plan the Republicans have to deal with these 1.6 million people who are already under a substance disorder medical coverage plan? What is their plan for these families who are already desperate for the medical help they are going need in order to stay alive, in order to get the help they and their families need? Those families know that any delay in a replacement being put on the books could be the difference between getting clean or getting buried.  This repeal effort is the worst kind of bait and switch. It is happening at a[[Page S128]]time when the American people can least afford it. Repeal is being done at the same time the Republican budget gives billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations and to the wealthy in tax breaks. So look at that as the balance we are talking about: 1.6 million people who have an addiction, a substance abuse problem, lose their coverage, but billionaires and corporations get the money through tax breaks that are going to be saved from cutting those programs for those who have a medical problem. That is immoral, ladies and gentlemen. That is plain and simply immoral.  You cannot give tax breaks to the wealthiest in our country until you take care of those who are the sickest, until you take care of those who are most in need, until you take care of those with substance abuse disorders in our country. It is immoral to cut the programs so you can give tax breaks to the wealthiest within our society.  We will not save lives and stop this scourge by paying lip service to providing treatment, but this is not the only casualty of this misguided budget before us. The hospitals that each and every one of our constituents depends upon are also at risk. The Affordable Care Act became law in no small part due to the support of those hospitals across the country. During that debate they knew full well the impact that a lack of insurance had not just on individuals but on the entire health care system.  The hospitals are on the frontlines of witnessing the financial burden that uninsured patients have on the system. We tell them they can never turn away a patient in need; then, when these patients cannot afford to pay for the care, it is up to the hospitals to foot the bill. So the hospitals told us that if we worked to reduce the number of uninsured they had to care for, then they would help us pay for improving the entire system.  They did pay, in no small part. That is why we have a new system in our country. As part of the ACA, the hospitals agreed to give up over $150 billion in payment reductions between 2010 and 2019. Those payment reductions came largely from Medicare and were attacked relentlessly by opponents of ObamaCare as an act to destroy the program, but the prophesied destruction did not occur, and the impact on Medicare has been quite the opposite.  Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare has seen its lowest per-member rate of spending growth in its 50-year history. Premiums paid by enrollees in Medicare Parts B and D have gone down. Perhaps most importantly, the savings have contributed to keeping our promise to America's seniors by ensuring that the program will continue to be there for them. Medicare's projected insolvency in the year 2017 has been extended for over a decade. All of this is possible, thanks to America's hospitals.  Here is what the Republicans are saying to Grandma and Grandpa: Yes, the Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of Medicare 10 years beyond 2017. We are repealing that bill. So, insolvency comes almost immediately to the Medicare system. What a great signal to send to Grandma and Grandpa this year with this bill on the Senate floor: insolvency of the Medicare system, the one thing that Grandma and Grandpa, and, by the way, everybody else inside every family in America is depending upon to take care of Grandma and  So will the budget before us return the savings they are expecting from this bill to the hospitals to help them cover the cost of Grandma and Grandpa? For that to happen, Medicare costs will go up. Higher costs will lead to higher premiums for every enrollee in Medicare Parts B and These higher costs will also be realized in the entirety of the Medicare Part A program, reducing the time of insolvency from 2028, down to 2024, 2023, 2022, or even earlier.  Those results are unacceptable to the Members of this Chamber and to their constituents, so it is now going to be a historic debate that we have. We can decide instead to simply not cut off the 20 million Americans from the insurance they need. We can ensure that hospitals have the resources to focus on the care for patients when it matters most. We can keep the promise to America's seniors that Medicare will be there to cover their needs when necessary.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

10051,topic-id,1308,"Mr.President, I come to the floor of the Senate tonight with my colleagues to share the stories of families in our home States whose lives are now healthier or have even been saved because of the Affordable Care Act, including those who depend on Medicare and Medicaid, people whose voices now more than ever need to be heard here in Washington,  But first, I am going to make clear how the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act will rip apart our health care system. And after what came to light late last week, I also come to the Senate floor tonight to stand with the millions of women, men, and families nationwide who are rightly outraged that this reckless and harmful effort also includes a plan to defund Planned  For 7 years now, congressional Republicans have made all kinds of empty promises about how undermining families' health care isn't going to hurt anyone; that if the Republican-controlled Congress privatizes Medicare, cuts Medicaid, defunds the Nation's largest provider of women's health care, and guts public health and prevention programs, somehow families are going to be magically better off.  Well, let me be clear. Ripping apart our healthcare system with no plan to replace it will create chaos. This is a view shared not just by the Senate Democrats who are here tonight but by independent experts. In fact, it is a view shared increasingly by State Republican leaders across the country, including some Senators and Congressmen.[[Page S141]]  Last Friday, just to cite one example, the Republican Governor of Arizona urged his party in Congress not to rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying: ``I don't want to see any Arizonan have the rug pulled out from underneath them in terms of changing this law.''  Mr.President, if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, it is women and kids and seniors and patients with serious illness and people with disabilities who will bear the burden. Premiums will skyrocket. Out-of-pocket prescription drug costs will rise, and overall health care costs will increase. It is a perfect storm to make America sick again and is absolutely the wrong direction for our families and our economy.  Mr.President, I have to say, I have never seen a start like this to a Congress, where the majority is jamming legislation through on a fast-tracked basis with no hearings for public debate or actual legislative text. As a former chairman of the Budget Committee, I have to say I have never seen such an abuse of the budget process.  What many of my Republican colleagues are doing right now is unprecedented, but it gets worse. As if all of their harmful plans weren't enough, House Republicans announced last week after meeting with Vice President-Elect Pence that they plan to defund Planned Parenthood in this budget. In other words, congressional Republicans are not only trying to undo a law that protects women from being charged more than men for their health care and ensures birth control is covered without a copay, they are also going after the Nation's largest provider of women's health care as well. They are doubling down on their shameful and tired obsession with undermining women's access to health care, and it will have devastating consequences for women's health and rights and economic security.  So I am here with a very clear message: not on my watch. I, along with my colleagues and women and men across the country, have fought this fight before in 2011, in 2013, in 2016, and we will fight it in 2017. We know what Planned Parenthood means to millions of patients--men and women--who have trusted it for over 100 years for cancer, STD screenings, for HIV tests, birth control, and so much more. We are not going to let extreme politics get in the way of their health care. So if Republicans think causing chaos in our health care system, heightening economic uncertainty, attacking women's health and rights, and burdening our seniors and their families with higher health care costs somehow makes our country ``greater,'' they are obviously not listening to millions of families who did not vote in November for higher premiums or a health care system thrown into chaos.  I have gone back to my home State of Washington, and I have heard from moms and dads and grandparents who are finally experiencing some stability and are able to cover their families with quality, affordable health insurance--many for the very first time. There was a mom from Bellingham, WA, who sent me a story about how the Affordable Care Act helped save her son's life when doctors found a life-threatening blood clot during a routine physical. She was not only able to afford the preventive check-up that found the clot because of her new coverage, but her son's treatment was then covered by the Affordable Care Act through the Medicaid expansion.  I heard from a small business owner from Spokane, WA, who told my office about his wife, a retired nurse of 62, and how she was able to get a better plan thanks to the Affordable Care He told us what this meant for his wife and his family. You bet he gets upset when he hears Republicans say the law hasn't worked for anyone or that they want to privatize Medicare by turning it into a voucher program.  Finally, I want to share the story of Kalon, who is a software engineer from Seattle, and his son Kalon reached out to my office right after the November election. Two years ago, his son Bryce was kayaking in West Virginia and he injured his back. The pain in Bryce's back didn't go away for months. What doctors first suspected as a stubborn muscle strain ended up to be a rare type of bone cancer called Ewing's sarcoma, a horrible illness. Thankfully, his family had health insurance.  Today Bryce is getting excellent treatment at Seattle Children's Hospital, where doctors have been able to ease some of his pain, and he is responding well now to chemotherapy. Bryce, who is now almost 18, will need care--expensive care--for many years to come, and Bryce's dad, Kalon, is greatly concerned that, if the Affordable Care Act goes away, the preexisting condition protection that we fought so hard for in this law will go away, and his son will not be able to afford health care or get the benefits or treatments he is going to need in the future.  Those are just three stories, but they represent many of the more than 600,000 people in my State who are part of the 30 million Americans across the country who are benefitting from this law today. Of course, there is more we need to do. I said it before. The work didn't end when the Affordable Care Act was passed--far from it. Democrats are ready. We have always been ready to work together to make health care more affordable and more successful and better for our families.  I hope Republicans reverse course right now and agree to work with us on improvements to the health care system. That is the path to take if they are truly serious about helping families. If they don't, and if they continue rushing to take away families' health care with no alternative plan, they will be fully responsible, and they certainly will be held accountable. The real impact will be on millions of families across our country, families like the ones I just talked about and those you are going to hear about throughout tonight--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents who do not want to see this law repealed and want us to work together to improve it instead.  I hope Republicans are listening. I urge them to make the right choice.  Thank you. I yield the floor.

10106,topic-id,482,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the doctor for that Webster's dictionary. That dictionary was published in Springfield, Massachusetts, and I am glad that the doctor from Tennessee sees it as the last word.  Mr.Speaker, let me rise in opposition to the CRA resolutions we are debating today that would block Department of Labor regulations on State-run retirement programs. Our country is in the midst of a retirement savings crisis, as duly noted. To address this issue, we should be working together to help people get into a responsible retirement savings plan. Half the people who get up to go to work every single day in America are not in a qualified savings plan for retirement.  This opportunity here is to begin a history lesson. In July of 2007, a decade ago, I introduced the Automatic IRA Act with my Republican Ways and Means colleague, Phil That same year, Senators Bingaman and Smith introduced a companion bill in the U.The Brookings Institution and The Heritage Foundation scholars jointly developed my auto IRA concept. So conservatives and liberals came together on a commonsense proposal to make it easier for working families to save.  However, fast forward to 2017. I can't find a Republican to join me in sponsoring the auto IRA legislation. Remember, The Heritage Foundation worked with me to construct this initiative. If we can just keep it amongst ourselves here, being a Democrat from Massachusetts and having a plan that is endorsed by The Heritage Foundation is not one of our easier endeavors. But between Brookings, a liberal think tank, and Heritage, a conservative think tank, we came up with a pretty good plan.  Today American families struggle to prepare for retirement. To make matters worse, 55 million Americans work for employers who don't offer a retirement plan. As I noted earlier, that is half the workers between 18 and 64.  Because of Congress' failure to act on any legislation and address the retirement savings crisis, many States implemented their own auto IRA plans based upon the Neal-English bill. In fact, 30 States have moved to implement or are considering a State-facilitated retirement plan. Credit unions would love this, community bankers would love this, and insurance agents would like to sell these plans, but here we can't find a Republican to sign on.  So today they are trying to block the guidance that provides clarity and flexibility to States that want to launch their own initiative. This is troubling. If these resolutions become law, it would have a chilling effect on State efforts. The States are the laboratories of experimenting on these retirement plans because the Federal Government doesn't get it done. If Republicans are looking for a single national effort, let's work together to develop a Federal auto IRA legislation piece that would work in the interim and work in the future and help people set up, Mr.Speaker, a responsible retirement savings plan.

9827,topic-id,680,"Mr.Speaker, nearly every day now, we hear about new ways our enemies are trying to steal Americans' information. Just a couple weeks ago, two Russian hackers were indicted for stealing personal information from millions of us.  American consumers visit billions of internet destinations through a multitude of devices. Broadband providers potentially have access to every bit of data that flows from a consumer. The American people are rightfully concerned about companies selling their personal information, including sensitive information like their location, financial and health information, Social Security numbers, and information about their children.  Late last year, the FCC took steps to protect every American citizen's data and privacy, and the rules were simple: first, broadband providers had to ask their customers before selling any data; second, the companies had to take reasonable measures to protect that data; and third, the companies had to let people know if their data was stolen.  That was a good first step, Mr.But Congress also has a role in protecting our data, and we should be working in a bipartisan fashion to discuss ways we can better protect the American people's data. Instead, the Republicans have decided to spend this time wiping out the few privacy safeguards that we already have.  The FCC's cybersecurity rules are, in my opinion, not burdensome. They simply tell the network providers to be reasonable when protecting the data. That is all. The FCC left it to the companies, themselves, to use their best judgment about how to get the job done. They just needed to be reasonable.  It seems being reasonable is still too much for the Republicans--first in the Senate, and now here in the This resolution tells the companies charged with running the country's broadband networks that they no longer have to be reasonable when it comes to their customers' data.  So I say, Mr.Speaker, make no mistake: This resolution is a gift to countries like Russia who want to take our citizens' personal information. And if the House passes this resolution, it will go straight to the President's desk, a President who will be more than happy to sign his name to this gift to the  This resolution also gives large corporations free rein to take customers' data without anyone's permission. This debate is about whether Americans have the freedom to decide on our privacy.  We hear all kinds of complicated arguments about jurisdiction, implementation dates, and who knows what else, but these arguments just muddy the water.  Republicans will say that the FCC's rules are confusing to consumers, people won't know what to do if they are asked first before broadband companies sell their sensitive information. If that were the case, we would have heard from people who oppose the rules, but we simply have not heard any of those concerns. The facts speak for themselves. Consumers want more privacy protection, not less.  Seventy-four percent of Americans say it is very important that they be in control of information, and 91 percent of people feel they have lost control[[Page H2495]]over their own information. There are real consequences to these feelings. Nearly half of Americans say they limit their online activity because they are worried about their privacy and security. That is why they overwhelmingly support stronger protections.  The FCC listened to the American people and adopted reasonable rules. Despite Republican claims to the contrary, the rules were not hard to follow. The rules still allow broadband companies to offer services based on their customers' data, and they can still customize ads or send reminders.  The FCC's rules simply required companies to ask people first before selling their sensitive information. That is it. In fact, I had hoped the FCC would have gone even further, but the agency chose this more moderate approach.  So as this debate proceeds, we should be asking one simple question: Should the American people have the freedom to choose how their information is used or should the government give that freedom away?  I think the answer is clear. I stand with the American people, and, therefore, I strongly oppose this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2489.txt,887,1415,2017.0,28.0,February

This budget that will be presented as an alternative also allows us to repeal ObamaCare at the same time. We have taken the identical language from the underlying budget, put it into the replacement budget, but we have done something different. Instead of allowing spending to continue to grow unabated, instead of allowing spending to grow at such a rate that we will add $9.7 trillion to the debt, we do something novel--something that I consider to be the conservative vision for our country. We actually freeze spending. We just say: no more spending. Interestingly, the budget will balance. The country's budget would actually balance, and we wouldn't add $9.7 trillion if we simply freeze spending. I think there is something in my version of the budget for both Republicans and Democrats because mine calls for a freeze in spending but would allow the different Appropriations subcommittees to decide where the spending would be cut.

You might not know that the Department of Commerce really could be eliminated and you really wouldn't notice that it was gone.  We look at the budget and we look at the spending every year, and we recount all of these terrible wasteful episodes of spending. Yet they never get fixed. Why? Because we continue to give government more money. The current budget that we will vote on will increase spending at about 5 percent a year.  You will hear from people this ``Washingtonese''--this language that says: Well, we are just holding to the baseline. All this is the baseline. Son, just vote for the baseline. Jump on the team and vote for the baseline. The problem is that the baseline is not flat. The baseline is inclined, and that increase in spending every year is what is bankrupting the country. Spending is going up 5 percent a year. That is what the baseline is. So when people say that we are going to cut trillions of dollars or this is a frugal budget, they are talking about cutting spending from the proposed increases in spending.  To illustrate that, the budget I am offering isn't even a cut of any kind. It is a freeze. Has anybody in America ever had their income frozen? Has anybody in America ever had to take a cut? Why shouldn't government? Why shouldn't we force government to look at their finances and say: You know what, this spending is good, and this is not so good.  I will give you an example. We spent $700,000 last year studying Neil Armstrong's statement on the moon. Neil Armstrong landed on the moon and said: ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' Your government, in its infinite wisdom, spent $700,000 to study that to determine whether Neil Armstrong said ``one small step for a man'' or ``one small step for man.'' After spending $700,000, your government concluded that they still don't know.  They spent $500,000 studying selfies. If you take a selfie of yourself and you smile, will you feel better later? They spent $2 million studying whether or not if you are standing in a food line at a buffet and the guy in front of you sneezes on the food, are you more or less likely to eat the food.  You can't make this stuff up. Yet the budget that we are being offered does nothing to fix any of that. It just puts a stamp down and says: We are going to keep doing things the same way we have always done them. Well, my friends I think we should do things differently.  I think a $20 trillion debt is alarming. I think it is the 1 problem we face as a country, and someone ought to do something about it. So I didn't have much luck saying: You know what, guys, we should produce a balanced budget.  So what we got is $9.7 trillion, and I can't support that. So I offer an alternative for people who believe that debt is a problem. They can vote for my alternative, and it still maintains the exact same language that the underlying budget has for repealing You can do both. Why should it be an either/or? Why should it be that, well, we have to vote for a crummy budget, but that is the only way we can get to Why don't we vote for a budget that balances? I thought that was what we were for.  I remember a time when Republicans talked about not only freezing spending, but some actually said we should reduce the size and scope of government. That is what Ronald Reagan said. Yet government grows inexorably. Over and over, year after year, government grows. We had Republicans in charge about 10 years ago. Remember? George Bush was We controlled, I think, both branches for at least one period of time, and yet the debt doubled under George Bush's administration from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Under President Obama, it has gone from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now you have Republicans saying: Put us in charge. Put us in charge of the You did, in 2010. Put us in charge of the You did, in 2017. Put us in charge of all three branches, and we will make a conservative vision for the country. We will balance budgets. We will reduce spending. Yet this is an all-Republican Congress where only Republicans will vote on the budget today, and yet we will be voting on a budget that will add $9.7 trillion.  I am told by some: This really isn't a budget; we are going to call it the vehicle to repeal  That is not what it is called. It is sitting right here. It is called the concurrent resolution on the budget for 2017--because, whoops, we didn't get to it last year, but we are getting to it this year.[[Page S137]]  This is the budget. It does have numbers in it, and I think the numbers in the budget are of significance. I think, when we look at the numbers, we should make them mean something. But people say to me: Well, numbers don't mean anything. Just vote for it so we can repeal We have to repeal So just vote for the numbers, no matter what they are.  I guess my response is this: If the numbers don't mean anything, why don't we put good numbers in there? If the budget is inconsequential and means absolutely nothing and only Republicans are going to vote for it, why don't we put numbers in it that lead to balance, because then we can go home to the people who voted for us and said they wanted us to balance the budget and wanted us to restrain ourselves and we can say we did what you told us to do. Instead, I have to go home and tell people that the Republicans introduced a budget that allows $9.7 trillion. I am told that we are going to do a better job, and 3 or 4 months from now we will do it again. I fear that in 3 or 4 months, when we come back, they will say: Well, you already voted for it once. Why don't you vote for it again? It is the same thing you voted for last time, and it is just a baseline. Well, the baseline is not flat. The baseline is increasing at 5 percent a year, and that is a problem.  We have to look at spending across the board. All of the spending has to be looked at. The great thing about what I offered as an alternative is that, whether you are a liberal or conservative, it doesn't define exactly where you have to have the cuts come from. It says what the overall number will be, and it will keep us from increasing spending. What you could do to get to a freeze is you could cut or eliminate some parts of the government, like maybe the $700,000 we spent studying Neil Armstrong's statement, which could be eliminated completely, and maybe the $30 billion we spend on corporate welfare in the Department of Maybe that can be eliminated and not one poor person would go hungry. Maybe a couple of rich CEOs will have to fly in their own jet instead of flying in a taxpayer jet when they are flying around the world. You could eliminate the Department of Commerce and you could keep spending for other items. If you think the military is bloated, you can actually cut money in the military and spend it on other items in the budget.  The bottom line is, if you vote for this amendment, you will be voting for fiscal conservatism that says: Enough is enough. We have a $20 trillion debt. We are borrowing $1 million a minute, and enough is enough. If you are a fiscal conservative, if you are worried about the debt of the country, I hope you will support my amendment, which replaces the underlying budget with a Federal on-budget spending freeze and actually leads the budget into balance in the near future.

It is a problem that Republicans should remember when they plan to raise costs on seniors, when they work to slash Medicaid and they destroy the sacred guarantee of  Yet, once again, Republicans have come to this floor not with the retirement security of hardworking families in mind, but with a greedy Wall Street first agenda.

The gentleman is talking about--some of these savings didn't even exist when we had the majority.  In States across the Nation, the great laboratories of our democracy went to work just as they should. My State of California decided to create something called Secure Choice, a State-run retirement plan that allows employees to be auto-enrolled into an IRA if they work for a business with five or more employees.  In doing so, California will give almost 7 million workers access to retirement savings--no substitute for a pension or a 401(k), but a vital step toward a greater retirement security.

On Friday, it will be 4 weeks since President Trump took office.  Let's go back 8 years to when President Obama took office. On January 20, 2009, President Obama stood on the steps of the Capitol and asked for swift, bold action now to create good-paying jobs, to establish education for the 21st century, and the list goes on for swift, bold action now.  One week and one day later, the House passed the American Recovery[[Page H1217]]and Reinvestment One week after that, the Senate passed the bill. And on February 17, which would be Friday of this week, 4 weeks since the inauguration of President Obama, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which created or saved around 4 million jobs of the American people, stopping the loss of jobs that existed in the Bush administration. That is something that is so remarkable.  So where is the jobs bill from the Republicans? Wasn't this election about jobs? Where is their jobs bill? Where is the infrastructure bill?  By the way, President Obama also passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act even before the American Recovery and Reinvestment He also signed the SCHIP program, which had bipartisan support in the Congress and much more.

9863,topic-id,1257,"Thank you so much, Mr.Thank you for convening us to talk about the first month of the Trump administration. The attacks on our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the rule of law are coming fast and furious, so it is hard to collect all of them, and I appreciate the effort to try to inventory them today.  I represent the wonderful people of Montgomery County, Frederick County, and Carroll County, Maryland, the Eighth Congressional District, and I am, by training, a professor of constitutional law which I have done for the last quarter century at American  So in reviewing the highlights--or the low lights--of the last several weeks, Mr.Garamendi, I thought I would start, actually, with my very first day on the job. I went to sign up for health insurance in the basement of the Longworth House Office Building, which I was delighted to do because my job entitles me to sign up for health insurance, and I recognized how fortunate I was. As I was down there, a number of other new Members began to form, and I looked at them.  Then, as I was going through, at the same time, some memoranda that my office had received, I noticed that some of the first bills we were going to be looking at were to set the stage for dismantling the Affordable Care Act, for voucherizing Medicare, for pulverizing Medicaid and downsizing it, for demonizing Planned Parenthood, and for making it impossible for hundreds of thousands of citizens across the country to get basic health care.  I said to myself: Tell me that it is not the case that I am entering Congress with other Members who are going to be signing up for health insurance that they get as part of their job, and then they are going to go upstairs to the floor of the House and vote to strip 22 million Americans of their health care in the Affordable Care  But, believe it or not, this is precisely what has transpired, and there is a very clear move on to try to dismantle the Affordable Care The majority has voted more than 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but America has woken up to the fact that it is for real this time, and we have hundreds of thousands--millions--of citizens mobilizing across the country to defend the Affordable Care Act and to demand accountability from their Member of I am thrilled to see that.  Also, during the last few weeks, we all read a report from 16 intelligence agencies of the United States, including the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and a dozen more, all of them expressing their confidence and their very strong belief that Vladimir Putin, the KGB, and the Russian Government worked a campaign to undermine and sabotage American democracy in the 2016 Presidential election. It included acts of cyber sabotage, espionage, fake news, and propaganda that all entered into American political discourse and our institutions in order to change the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election.  What we have gotten from the President of the United States is a series of blithe dismissals of the whole thing saying repeatedly: Other people do the same.  I think it was yesterday that commentator Bill O'Reilly said that he needed to criticize Vladimir Putin, who was a killer, to which the President responded: Lots of people are killers. And, essentially: Have you looked at what America has done recently?  That kind of talk is absolutely outrageous and scandalous that the President would say that.  The point is not to join the killers of the world. The point is not to participate in the league of bandits, bullies, dictators, despots, and rightwing movements that are forming all over the world. The point is to take them on and to stand up for democracy, human rights, and the real ideals of the country.  So back in the home office, in Moscow, they must be chortling that the President of the United States would establish a moral equivalency between the first democracy--the first constitutional democracy ever created on Earth--and a thug who is presiding over essentially a kleptocratic, authoritarian regime in Russia, a man who has said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the single greatest catastrophe of the 20th century.  So we have that to deal with.  Meantime, instead of taking on the real authoritarians on Earth, the President summons up all of his courage with Steve Bannon, and they impose a ban on people coming to America from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; and they invoke 9/11 several times in the course of establishing this unprecedented refugee ban. The only problem is that the terrorist hijackers who came to attack[[Page H1062]]the country on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab The vast majority of them came from Saudi Arabia, which is the stronghold and the organizing center of Wahhabism, fundamentalism, radical Islamic terrorism on Earth which has been promoting and disseminating militant Islamist ideology all over the world. Yet, the Trump administration did nothing about that, either because they were too powerful for them to take on or because Mr.Trump has had extensive business dealings with Saudi Arabia, as well as in other countries that were passed over in this ban.  Now, of course, because this is a religiously oriented Muslim ban that is meant to whip up propaganda, hysteria, and chaos in the country and has nothing to do with national security, it has been struck down in different parts or in whole by five or six Federal district courts, most recently by the United States District Court in The case is now in the Ninth Circuit Court of  There are so many problems with the executive order in terms of due process, equal protection, free exercise of religion, and so on, that there are multiple judicial decisions that are striking down different aspects of the executive order.  Well, what else do we have going on? Today, in one of the committees that I serve on, the House Administration Committee, there was a 6-3 vote to dismantle the only Federal election entity, the EAC, which is charged with trying to promote the cybersecurity of our elections. That vote was along party lines--6-3--to dismantle the Election Assistance Commission which had been created and established on a bipartisan vote many years ago. That was just taken down.  So I would say that there appears to be an effort to plunge America into a certain kind of chaos at this point. That, of course, has been the explicit wish of Steve Bannon, who has described himself as a Leninist who wants to tear down our system of government and demolish the politics of the country to replace with something else which has gone un-named.  So, my fellow Americans, Mr.Garamendi, these are very serious times. I am thrilled that the people of America are organizing in every State of the Union and in every community to build up the capacity to resist these attacks on our Constitution, on our Bill of Rights, and on the rule of law. The majority of the people who did not vote for this President are mobilized, they are galvanized, and they understand that eternal vigilance is, indeed, the price of liberty, and people are going to remain eternally vigilant--and passionately so--during the course of this administration when the attacks continue to come fast and furious on our Constitution and our Bill of  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1059-3.txt,99999999999999,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,7.0,January

10052,topic-id,2759,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the budget resolution that the Senate will vote on this week. We are nearly half way through the fiscal year, and the Republicans have offered this budget resolution not to set a path forward for spending for the year but to give them the ability to repeal the Affordable Care Act through the budget process, requiring less support than is needed under regular order. This budget is nothing more than a sham, being used to take away health insurance from more than 20 million What is worse is that my Republican colleagues intend to do so without any plan in place to mitigate the impact and protect the people who will be harmed.  The uninsured rate is at its lowest point in recent history. Since the implementation of the ACA in my State of Rhode Island, the uninsured rate has fallen from 12 percent to under 4.5 percent. In real terms, that means that over 100,000 people in Rhode Island have gained coverage because of the That is about 10 percent of my State's population. Over 30,000 middle-income Rhode Islanders get tax credits averaging $250 a month to help them afford coverage on the State's health insurance marketplace.  We cannot go back to a system that allows private insurers to deny coverage for preexisting conditions or charge more to those who need insurance the most. In fact, the Republican plan for repealing the ACA means that nearly half a million Rhode Islanders with preexisting conditions, about half the State's population, will be denied coverage or will be charged more. Again, as Senator Murray described so eloquently in the case of a young man who needs years of expensive treatment, if preexisting conditions are once again possible and if that young man is dropped from his parents' plan at 21, both of those factors will probably deny him the coverage that he enjoys today, and that is not what we want to do. I hope that is not what we want to do.  In my State, there are over 106,000 Rhode Islanders with diabetes, over 112,000 with asthma, and nearly 63,000 cancer survivors who will be forced to pay more for coverage. These are huge numbers in my State--roughly 1 million people in population. They have these conditions, and insurance companies said in the past: We won't cover[[Page S142]]you, or, by the way, you will be spending 2, 3, 5, 10 times as much for the coverage we extend to someone else.  We have also been able to improve coverage through the ACA for those who are getting their care through their employer. Before the ACA, insurance plans, including employer-sponsored health coverage, could impose annual or lifetime limits on coverage, meaning that coverage could end when it was most needed. You could have a job, and you could have insurance at a job, but if you have a serious condition, when you reach that limit, that is it--no more responsibility by the company. That is exactly the time you need the help because you have already either exhausted some of your own resources or you are in a position where you have been sick for so long that your ability to go back into the workplace is practically nonexistent. The ACA prohibits these limits, along with ensuring free preventive care and coverage of dependents up to age 26, ensuring real coverage for nearly 600,000 workers in Rhode Island with employer coverage.  There is a perception out there that the ACA doesn't apply to employer coverage and that it has no effect--that if it is repealed, it is fine because I get my health insurance from my employer. That is not the case. The impact will be there, and it could leave many people devastated.  Additionally, the ACA strengthened the rate review processes to help control premiums. Prior to the ACA, double-digit increases were always the norm. When I served in the House and in my first years in the Senate, invariably, when trade associations came to visit me, the first or second issue on the list was this: Our insurance coverage just went up 20 percent. We can't afford it anymore. We are dropping coverage or telling our workers: Do you want a raise, or do you want coverage? You can't get both.  Well, we have to do more to keep premiums under control and bring down costs, but there has been an improvement under the ACA in my State and in many other In 2 of the last 3 years, premiums actually went down from the previous year in Rhode During open enrollment for 2017, Rhode Islanders saw decreases of as much as 5 percent in their premiums. In fact, due to the ACA, consumers in Rhode Island have saved nearly $220 million since 2012, according to the State resource.  This program has done something that we were feverishly trying to do, which was to somehow bring costs under control and reduce them if we could but certainly eliminate the double-digit growth, when every year every employer group was coming in and saying: We can't afford this. We want to cover our workers, but we can't. We are giving them that choice, or we will have to sadly say we can't give you insurance anymore. Repealing the ACA would end all of these consumer protections and put insurance companies back in charge.  One other thing that it has done is that we actually required that a significant amount of the premium be used for health care, not overhead. We actually built into the law that, if you are going to charge a premium, it better go to help people get health care, not just to boost your profits, dividends, or anything else. That is another factor that has helped positively this rate and premium structure.  Then, of course, there is a huge economic impact of ACA repeal. For years I have heard my Republican colleagues very sincerely and adamantly declare that the ACA is a job killer, that it was going to destroy millions of jobs. That was one of the refrains that echoed throughout this Chamber as we were debating the ACA for months and years afterwards. But what has happened? We have had an unprecedented 75 consecutive months of job growth--something we haven't seen since 1939. Repealing the ACA would wreak havoc on this progress. Premiums for everyone, not just those in the individual market, will skyrocket. Large businesses will see their health care costs go up, which means workers will forgo pay increases as their employers struggle to simply maintain health care coverage or they will drop the coverage entirely.  We have come a long way since the economic downturn in 2008, and we have much more work to do to keep things moving in the right direction, but one of the worst things we can do for the economy is to repeal the  Rhode Island stands to lose over $7 billion in Federal funding over the next 10 years with repeal. Again, that is a staggering number in my State--$7 billion. That would be devastating for the State because they would have to step up as best they could, and frankly, they don't have the kind of resources to replace that loss. It would have an effect on hospitals and other health care providers. Hospitals in Rhode Island stand to lose nearly $2 billion in funding on top of the added expenses of emergency room care for the newly uninsured. We remember the old model of health care. The old model was that, if you didn't have insurance, you went to the emergency room. Those emergency rooms were crowded with people. They were much more expensive to treat because they were there without any previous experience with the physicians and without health records, in many cases. They had to do diagnostic tests that were not available and that are now available at the health care facilities because they have insurance. All of that would come undone. It will be a huge impact on the economy.  One of the largest employers in the State of Rhode Island is the hospital system. I don't think we are alone. If you go out into the rural parts of the United States, in many cases, the biggest employer in many counties is the health care system, the hospital system. When they can no longer make their books balance, they are going to have to start closing down operations, laying people off. That is what is going to happen. This is not farfetched. We have seen it before. We have seen struggling hospitals struggling under emergency room uncompensated care. We have seen all these things happen before. Repealing the ACA would lead to a combination of all these factors--skyrocketing premiums and the loss of Federal funding in health care for States, which would have a ripple effect throughout the country.  If Rhode Island or any other State has to step in and partially make up for the loss of Medicaid funds or any other aspect of this program, where are they taking it from? Where are they taking it from? Education, infrastructure, public safety. They will suffer. Ultimately, it is the jobs--the jobs of the people in my State and the jobs of people across the  So there are things we can do to strengthen the bill. Senator Murray was very clear about attempts we have made. She has been one of the great leaders in this effort to make improvements. We have been working on and improving Medicare since 1965, and we still have some work to do, but that was a different program. That was a program that was a bipartisan program, one that was embraced and developed and supported. In fact, one of the ironies today is some of the staunchest supporters and protectors of Medicare are Republicans, as well as Democrats, but that was a program that took several decades to work through, and we are still working through issues with respect to We are prepared to do that with the Affordable Care Act in a principled, thoughtful, practical, pragmatic way, not to score political points, but to make it a system that is more affordable, more effective, and that gives more American families a chance. Frankly, you don't have much of a chance for a good education, a good job, or a secure retirement when your health is in jeopardy and your finances are equally in jeopardy.  At this point, the Republicans have offered no plan to replace the ACA, and it is a tough task. I served on the HELP Committee as we were drafting this, and we spent over a year on this law. We spent countless moments reaching out to our colleagues on the Republican side asking: Can we make this better? What improvements can we make? We had numerous folks in the mix. It is tough work. To suggest that we can just repeal this and something will magically appear, I don't think that is particularly logical, obvious, or will happen.  Roughly, 7 years have gone by since the passage of this bill, where the Republicans have had a chance to prepare a detailed plan to replace aspects of the ACA or replace it. I don't think that plan is out there. It is certainly not being communicated.  We have to ensure--and Senator Murray was very effective in making this point--that we can improve ACA,[[Page S143]]not demolish it, that, if we get into a legislative process, we produce a better outcome for the American people, not an outcome of denial of health care and financial uncertainty and perhaps even financial ruin.  So we have to get to work. I think we are prepared to do this but in the context of something pragmatic and productive for the benefit of the American people.  Let me switch gears, just for a moment, and talk about Medicare and Medicaid because, when people talk about Medicare and Medicaid, they usually don't make an association with the They think that is something else. I can recall being in a public discussion in August of 2009, when we were discussing ACA before it became law, and something came up that was very critical about the program because they didn't want publicly funded insurance in any way, shape, or form, and I asked: Where do you get your health care?  Well, I have a private provider.  Again, I asked: Where do you get your health care?  I am on  Medicare is, as I recall, a single-payer national system of health care, a funded entitlement by the government, with some copayments by participants.  Medicare and Medicaid are effective in a significant way. We made historic improvements to these programs, enhancing benefits. Indeed, we added 9 years of solvency to the Medicare trust fund. One of the great issues that reverberates throughout this Chamber is we have to control entitlements. We have to prepare for the future. We have to make sure these social programs like Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and others are solvent. We added years of solvency to the program in the If it is repealed, subtract 9 years of solvency from the Medicare trust fund. Tell seniors and people in their fifties who are getting ready to enjoy the benefits: Just take 9 years off your expected benefits, or at least a portion of the benefits.  The ACA made a number of other improvements. They closed and are closing the doughnut hole for prescriptions, they eliminated cost sharing for cancer screenings, for example, for Medicare recipients. Over 15,000 Rhode Islanders saved $14 million on drugs in 2015. That is an average of $912 per Medicare beneficiary because of what we did with respect to the doughnut hole. In the same year, over 92,000 Rhode Islanders--huge numbers in my State--took advantage of free preventive services, representing over 76 percent of the beneficiaries. Seventy-six percent of the Medicare beneficiaries in my State took advantage of free services. Otherwise, they would have paid out of their pocket, and, frankly, many seniors don't have the resources to do that. Repealing the ACA means these benefits go away, and it shortens the trust fund by about a decade.  Repeal would also mean cutting $270 million in Federal funds to help pay for health coverage for low-income adults, children, seniors, and people with disabilities through The ACA expanded eligibility and streamlined enrollment and made it easier for the most vulnerable to access quality health care coverage. As a result, approximately 70,000 Rhode Islanders were able to access coverage for the first time through Medicaid--their previous source of health care: most times, the emergency room, if they could get there.  I want to point out a couple of things about Medicaid has become a program for our senior citizens that happens to also help struggling Seniors make up a small percentage of the Medicaid population but account for approximately half of Medicaid spending nationwide. Nearly 60 percent of nursing home residents are covered by Think about that. Sixty percent of all nursing home residents need The next time you hear someone casually suggest drastic cuts and changes to Medicaid, think about that. Those cuts will work their way back to nursing homes throughout your Those families of those seniors are not all people who have been poor and on the margins all of their lives; they are our neighbors, and they will feel it.  In Rhode Island, over 30,000 seniors access health care coverage through My colleagues across the aisle want to make drastic cuts to Make no mistake, cuts to Medicaid mean cuts to nursing home services for seniors and a return to pre-Medicaid times when the elderly had few options. In the 1950s and 1960s, before Medicare and Medicaid, your grandmother or grandfather was in your living room in a hospital bed being taken care of by typically your mother. That is the way you grew up back in the 1950s and 1960s in most middle-income neighborhoods. That was at least my experience. If you want to go back, that is what would happen, in some respects, if we repeal this law.  If Republicans want to come and work with us, we are ready--more than ready--but we can't stand by and allow them to do the damage they propose: to take away coverage from 20 million Americans and cut benefits to seniors. That is not the right direction for America and for our country.  With that, I yield the floor.

This is, obviously, in the context, like the gentlewoman from California pointed out, of the fiduciary rule, which we are familiar with. That was an effort by the Obama administration to promulgate a new rule to create a new standard that would have an impact, Mr.Speaker, on investment advice.  It was clear that the net result of that was to do what? It would have crowded people out at the lower end of the economic spectrum, not give them access to the coverage or the advice that they needed, because the advice, Mr.Speaker, would have been too expensive, and it would have created the self-fulfilling prophecy, unfortunately, where wealthier people, who can afford it, are able to get good advice.  It was a terrible idea. We worked on a bipartisan basis. The administration[[Page H1213]]wouldn't have any part of the bipartisan solution. They jammed the rule down. It was a bad idea.  Yet, the same administration, Mr.Speaker, is now saying to the entities that we really shouldn't have confidence in, that is States and localities on these pensions, you have more flexibility.

They come because they are motivated by the transcendent truth that was captured in our Declaration of Independence that everyone is endowed by a Creator with an inalienable right to life--a right that no one can take away.                              {time}  1830  Everyone in this Chamber has that right.

Here we are in the world's greatest deliberative body--the world's greatest deliberative body--and there really are so many talented individuals who come from county counsels, who come from State assemblies, who come from State senates, who come from the U.House, and find themselves in the U.Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body. And here we are debating one of the biggest public policy issues over the last decade, arguably over the last generation. Here we are.  I am thinking about my early days in the Hawaii legislature and what we would do. If we wanted to move a bill along but we weren't sure exactly what to do, we would flaw the effective date because we knew the language didn't work yet, but we wanted to take it to conference committee. We didn't want it to be enacted into law, but we wanted it to move through the process. So what we would do is we would flaw the effective date. We would say ``Effective year 2100,'' so that even if it were accidentally enacted into law, it wouldn't have the force of law.  Yet once in a while, a staffer or a member would make a clerical error and actually enact something with a delayed effective date into law, and they were humiliated. This was a mistake. This was a clerical error, and this showed that it was amateur hour. This showed that somebody didn't know what they were doing. This showed that somebody wasn't a very serious legislator.  Yet here we are in the Nation's legislature, here we are in the world's greatest deliberative body, and we are doing that on purpose. We are doing that right away. We are doing this with the Affordable Care Act after 7 years of blasting this law because they know they can't repeal the parts that are popular. So what they are going to do is eviscerate the revenue attached to the bill and leave themselves, as one of my colleagues said, in a ``box canyon'' so the only thing they can do is shovel money to insurance companies--borrowed money--to maintain the benefit because they don't want to deal with the political ramifications of what they had done to their constituents on preexisting conditions, on coverage for people up to the age of 26, on prevention.  This is the most unserious effort I have seen in this legislative body. This is absolutely unserious. And whatever your political persuasion is, you should ask every Member of the Senate to stand up and be counted and say what they want to do about health care in the United  The answer can no longer be because it is an article of faith that because the Affordable Care Act has ``Obama'' in its name--it is ObamaCare--it must be bad, and it must be repealed root and branch. That is no longer acceptable.  This President is only President for another 10 days, and we have an obligation to our constituents to say what we are going to do about this law. We all know that we should get a regular check-up from our doctor, eat fruits and vegetables, and exercise as much as possible, as difficult as it is for all of us at times. Why do we do this? Any doctor will tell you that it is better to stay healthy and prevent disease than to get sick. It is not just common sense. It is not only less painful for people, but it is less costly to prevent illness than to treat it.  The same is true for public health. If we can prevent drunk driving or the spread of diseases such as Zika, we could save lives and save the public money. That is why Senator Cassidy and I introduced the Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act last Our bill, on a bipartisan basis, recognized, basically, that we should be able to respond quickly to public health threats before they spread and harm more Americans and cost more money.  That is what the ACA does through its Prevention and Public Health The fund serves a very important dual purpose, investing Federal dollars in effective programs that prevent disease and also it saves money.  It is a simple concept. We should stop diseases from developing or spreading before they start. This sounds like common sense to almost everybody, but here is the problem. In the partisan battle around the ACA, even a really good idea within the Affordable Care Act must be bad because it is part of This is insane.  This is the Prevention and Public Health Fund that provides money to the Centers for Disease The CDC did an incredible job with the U.Public Health Service, with the U.military in addressing the Ebola crisis. The CDC did an incredible job, again, with the National Institutes of Health and others in addressing the potential Zika crisis, which looks to have abated. The CDC does incredibly important work in tobacco prevention and cessation, and this Prevention and Public Health Fund has gotten 1.8 million individual smokers to call and try to quit smoking. That is hundreds of thousands of lives saved, not just in blue or purple States but all across the country. This Prevention and Public Health Fund helps our elderly to avoid falls. It helps our elderly to avoid falls. I know there are people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle. I know that we are all responsive to our senior citizens in our individual communities, and I know that this is a smart and humane use of public health money. If we can prevent an elderly citizen from falling in their own home or falling on the way to a bus stop or to church or to a family member's home, that is money well spent, not just morally but fiscally.  This is my great regret when it comes to the Affordable Care Act and the debate that is happening. The only time I hear a serious-minded, good-faith debate between a Republican and a Democrat in the Senate when it comes to the Affordable Care Act is in private, because if you look at this side of the Chamber, there is only one Member of the Republican caucus who is here. We are not having the world's greatest deliberative body deliberate over the Affordable Care We have an empty Chamber, full of Republicans who are absolutely bound and determined to walk off this cliff and take 22 million Americans with them.  Public health prevention works. Public health prevention is fiscally prudent, and it is the humane thing to do. That is just one of the many attributes[[Page S151]]of the Affordable Care Act that ought to be preserved.  If there is to be a good faith conversation about how to improve upon the Affordable Care Act, we are all ears. I can guarantee you that there are 48 of us who want to have that conversation, but do not put the whole country into this box canyon. Excuse me for mixing my metaphors.

9789,topic-id,464,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.1677, Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017.  I commend Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Chairman Tom Marino and Ranking Member David Cicilline, as well as Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, for their leadership on this bill.  I support this legislation for several reasons. To begin with, H.1667 addresses a real need recognized by regulatory agencies, bankruptcy experts, and the private sector that the bankruptcy law must be amended so that it can expeditiously restore trust in the financial marketplace as soon as possible after the collapse of a systemically significant financial institution.  This need is perhaps best illustrated by the collapse and subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008. As a result of that firm's failure and the rampant uncertainty it generated, a worldwide freeze on the availability of credit quickly developed. This, in turn, triggered a near collapse of our Nation's economy and clearly revealed that current bankruptcy law is ill-equipped to deal with complex financial institutions in acute economic distress.  H.1667 would establish a specialized form of bankruptcy relief specifically designed to facilitate the expeditious resolution of a large, systemically significant financial institution, such as Lehman Brothers, while minimizing its impact on the financial marketplace.  Under the bill, the debtor's operating subsidiaries would continue to function outside of bankruptcy, while the debtor's principal assets, such as its secured property, financial contracts, and the stock of its subsidiaries, would be transferred to a temporary ``bridge company.''  The bridge company, under the guidance of a trustee, would then liquidate these assets to pay the claims of the debtor's creditors. The bill would also temporarily prevent parties from exercising their rights in certain qualified financial contracts.  Each critical step of this process would be done under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge and subject to appeal.  Another reason I support this bill is that it appropriately recognizes the important role the Dodd-Frank Act has in the regulation of large financial institutions. Without doubt, the Great Recession was a direct result of the regulatory environment at the time. Fortunately, the Dodd-Frank Act has done much toward reinvigorating a regulatory system that makes the financial marketplace more accountable and more resilient.  In particular, title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a mandatory resolution process to wind down large financial institutions, which is a critical enforcement tool for bank regulators to ensure compliance with the act's heightened regulatory requirement.  H.1667 is an excellent complement to the Dodd-Frank Act's resolution process and will help facilitate the rapid administration of a debtor's assets in an orderly fashion that maximizes value and minimizes disruption to the financial marketplace.  Accordingly, I support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

9948,topic-id,3189,"Mr.President, first, I want to thank my friend the majority leader. As this is the first time offering opening remarks with the Republican leader, I will speak a little longer than he did today. After all, it is my first speech.  I want to start by extending my sincerest wish to him that we be able to work together to get things done for the American people. The Republican leader is my friend. He is also a great believer and defender of the Senate and the important role it must play in our national life and around the world. I look forward to working with him to[[Page S8]]preserve that legacy. Coming from the swearing-in ceremony, as we just did, I thank the people of my home State of New York for entrusting me with the most sacred obligation to represent them, to be their voice in the United States It has been the honor of my life to serve them, to use what ability I have been given on their behalf, to endeavor to make their lives and the lives of their fellow Americans better, safer, more prosperous, and more free.  I could never have done this job I love if not for my family, my wife Iris and two beautiful daughters, Jessica and Allison, my parents, age 93 and 88, Abe and Selma, who came down from New York for this occasion, and my new son-in-law They support me. They keep me going through the good times and the bad and, maybe most importantly, they tell me when I am wrong. They are my rock and the light of my life.  I would also like to acknowledge, in this my first speech as Democratic leader, that I am honored and humbled by my caucus for the trust they placed in me to lead them in this new We are like a second family. We watch each other's backs, we seek unity, and like a family, while we at times may have disagreements, we always move forward together. We are a big, diverse group from all walks of life and political perspectives, from all corners of this great country, but at the end of the day, we are family. To have earned their trust and support means the world, and I will try every day to deserve it.  To my staff, another second family of mine, thank you. Most of them are working, I guess. They are not here anymore. There are so many hard-working, dedicated, and brilliant men and women who over the years have put their shoulders to the wheel to help New York, this country, and me. There are too many to name. I wish I could name them all, but I must mention two, Mike Lynch and Martin Brennan, who have been with me since the 1998 campaign, the twin pillars of my office. Whatever success I have had in my campaigns, it can be traced back to them. So I thank them and all of my staff, past and present, from the bottom of my heart.  Finally, although he is no longer a Member of this esteemed body, I salute the outgoing leader, my predecessor, mentor, and friend for life, Harry Thank you.  Now is a time to look forward. We Democrats lost the election. It is a result many of us did not expect. It was a result none of us hoped for. When you lose an election like this, you can't flinch, you can't blink. You have to look it right in the eye, analyze it, learn from it and, most importantly, make corrections and move forward. It is easy to blame the results and elections on outside forces, and it is true that any one of them or a few in combination could have been responsible for the outcome of an election which the Democrat candidate won by nearly 3 million votes but lost by slim margins in a few States that decided the electoral college.  It is easy to look back and place blame, but now is the time to look forward. I believe the Democrats must take a hard look at what we can do better. It is clear that many Americans felt the economy was rigged against them and that their government wasn't looking out for them. It was too beholden to Big Money and special interests. Democrats did not do enough to show American workers we are the party that has their backs, that our positions are much more in line with their needs than the Republican positions, and so, as we look to this new Congress and a new Presidency, Senate Democrats will once again recommit ourselves to a set of principles that has always been at the core of our party, what my beloved friend and mentor Senator Ted Kennedy called economic justice. It is what our party has stood for since the days of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson through FDR, whose enduring New Deal is now almost a century old. It has been reaffirmed and deepened by passionate advocates like Susan Anthony, Cesar Chavez, and Martin Luther King, Jr., a commitment to the common man, to economic fairness for the American worker, to opportunity and prosperity for the American middle class and those trying to get there.  What is needed from we Democrats is a bigger, bolder, sharper-edged economic program that addresses how those struggling to stay in the middle class can stay there and those struggling to make it into the middle class can get there more easily and deals directly with the unfairness so many see and experience in our economic system. That is a mission that unites our caucus, from my friend from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, to my friend from Vermont, Senator Sanders, and one that appeals to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia and Michigan just as deeply as the college student from Los Angeles who is struggling with student debt. It appeals to the factory worker in the heartland just as much as to the immigrant family in New York City and the single mom in Cleveland trying to make ends meet on minimum wage.  There are a great many things we Democrats would like to do in the Senate to help these people, to ease the burden on the middle class and those struggling to make it--creating more jobs by investing in infrastructure and education, science and medicine, making college more affordable, increasing the minimum wage, changing our trade laws and so much more.  We will be making proposals we hope our Republican colleagues will join us on. As the year wears on, and it becomes clear that Democratic proposals are what the American people want and need, I hope many will. But we are not in the majority. Therefore, we cannot delude anyone that this Congress will start tomorrow taking up priorities of the Democratic minority. But we can raise our voices to present an alternative way forward, and we can rally the American people to support this program.  As Republicans return majorities to both Houses of Congress and we prepare for a Republican in the White House, the Democratic minority in the Senate has a very important task ahead of it.  There are those who suggest our baseline posture should be to work with the President-elect and have him pass his whole agenda, but it is not our job to be a rubberstamp. It is our job to do what is best for the American people, the middle class, and those struggling to get there. For instance, if the President-elect proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure and trade and closing the carried interest loophole, we will work in good faith to perfect and potentially enact it, but when he doesn't, we will resist. What we will always do is hold the President-elect and his Republican colleagues in Congress accountable--accountable to the working people to whom the President-elect promised so much; accountable to the people of all colors, creeds and sexual orientations in this country for whom he is President; accountable to the millions of Americans who voted for him even though many of the Republican policies he now, postelection, seems to be embracing are inimical to their interests; and perhaps most importantly, accountable to the law.  The Senate has a rich, bipartisan tradition of being a constitutional check on Presidents of both parties. Many in this body have long observed that in America we are a nation of laws, not men. That sacred constitutional duty of holding the President accountable to the law must continue, and Democrats will make sure of it. Sometimes it will mean pointing out where rhetoric and reality diverge, and sometimes it will mean resisting the President and Republicans in Congress when they propose legislation that we believe will hurt the American people. This will be an accountable Congress, and we will be a caucus that makes sure the President-elect keeps his commitment to truly make America great again in its finest sense and tradition.  We know what makes America great, a fundamental optimism, a belief that the future will bring every child more opportunity than their parents, a conviction that this American dream can be shared by all of us, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation. We will hold President-Elect Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great, but we will fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness, instincts that have too often plagued this country and too often plagued his campaign, and we will have benchmarks throughout the campaign. The President-elect said he could push GDP[[Page S9]]growth to 5 percent or 6 percent. He complained that the real unemployment rate was too high and he would bring it down. We will hold him accountable to that. What does he think he can achieve in a year or two or four? What policies does he propose to achieve those goals? He promised to be much tougher on China, even though many Republicans for years have resisted legislation in Congress to do that. We will hold him accountable for it and demand he keep his promise. He promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, but tapped an avowed critic of Medicare, a man who has spent his career advocating for its demise as his Secretary of Health and Human We demand that he keep his promise not to cut Social Security or He says he wants to build a strong America and earn respect around the world but seems to be marching in lockstep with the bullying, despicable autocrat who has caused a great deal of trouble around the globe and here in America, Vladimir We will hold him accountable to that.  We will hold the President accountable if he doesn't nominate a mainstream Supreme Court President Obama nominated a mainstream candidate in Merrick President-Elect Trump should do the same. The President-elect said a great many things about rebuilding our infrastructure. Democrats welcome that discussion, but how is he going to do it? We have thousands of bridges and tunnels and highways and schools, waste water systems, airports in need of repair, not only in our big cities but in rural and suburban communities throughout A program of tax credits isn't going to get the job done no matter how large. We need significant direct spending. How does the President-elect plan to get that done? The President-elect has said there are several parts of the Affordable Care Act he favors. We will hold him accountable to that. The ACA extended affordable health care to 30 million We ask the President-elect, if you repeal the ACA, what are you going to do to protect these 30 million people? How are you going to ensure that a kid right out of college can stay on his parent's or her parent's plan, that the mother with a child who has a preexisting condition can get health care for her child, that women everywhere are not charged more for their care simply because they are a woman? It is not acceptable to repeal the law, throw our health care system into chaos, and then leave the hard work for another day.  Mr.President-elect, what is your plan to make sure all Americans can get affordable health care? We will hold the President-elect accountable for actually creating jobs and raising incomes, growing our economy and lowering our trade deficit, for protecting voting rights and civil rights, for safeguarding our clean air and clean water, for maintaining our commitment to our Nation's veterans and troops and their families, for giving that worker in Michigan, that college student in L.A., that single mother in Cleveland a real opportunity and a ladder up. What could be fairer? After all, his biggest and most consistent pledge was that he would, ``Make America Great,'' make the lives of Americans better. We, the Democrats of this Senate, will hold him accountable to that, and we will resist him if he breaks that promise. While we respect the Office of the Presidency, we will not hesitate for a moment to call out the person occupying that office if he demeans women or Muslims or Latinos or our friends in the LGBT community, and if allies or aides to the President demean a group of Americans, we will not hesitate for a moment to demand that our new President condemn these comments, not sidestep them, not simply distance himself from them, condemn them, pointedly and roundly, as Presidents of both parties--every President of both parties--have done throughout the decades. We will hold President-Elect Trump accountable to the finest instincts of what America has always stood for, e pluribus unum.  The bottom line is, the President-elect ran as a change agent. He ran against the establishments of both parties. He promised to change the way America operates, to oppose elites, drain the swamp, pay attention to working families, but, my friends, since the election, he seems to have forgotten that.  Looking at the Cabinet, which is stacked with billionaires, corporate executives, titans of Wall Street, and those deeply embedded in Washington's corridor of power, it seems that many of his campaign themes are quickly being abandoned.  He said he was going to unrig the system. So far, it still looks rigged. Too many of his Cabinet picks support the same hard-right doctrinaire positions that many in the Republican Party have held for years, policies that the American people have repeatedly rejected. If President-Elect Trump lets the hard-right Members of Congress and his Cabinet run the show, if he attempts to adopt their timeworn policies which benefit the elite, the special interests, and corporate America, not the working man and woman, his Presidency will not succeed--maybe not in the first 90 days but certainly in the first 2 years. Unfortunately, that seems to be the path he is following throughout the transition.  So Mr.President-Elect, if there is one part of my speech that I hope you listen to and take to heart it is this one. I mean it with the best of intentions. If you abandon change and simply embrace the shopworn, hard-right, pro-corporate, pro-elite policies diametrically opposed to the many campaign themes that helped you win working class votes and get you elected, your Presidency will not succeed.  We Democrats will hold you accountable to the working people of America, not to the conservative ideologues in Washington who seem to have great number in your We will hold your feet to the fire every time you abandon your pledge and work instead as an ally of the hard right.  The issues facing this country are many. We have a lot of work to do--creating jobs, raising incomes, making college and health care affordable, rebuilding our infrastructure, making trade laws work for the American worker, keeping Americans safe from threats of violence and terrorism, taking care of our vets. Each one takes serious thought and action. These issues are too important for mere words.  Our challenge is too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter We have real challenges, and we have real needs to get things done. Many Americans are afraid, Mr.President-Elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices.  There is nothing wrong with using Twitter to speak to the American people. It is a good use of modern media. But these issues are complex and command both careful consideration and action. We cannot tweet them away. For instance, a tweet bragging about the 800 jobs that were saved at the Carrier plant does not solve the underlying problem. While it is good the 800 jobs were saved, even at Carrier, 1,300 jobs are still leaving. Hundreds more jobs are leaving from the nearby Rexnord plant down the road; they are going overseas.  Most importantly, thousands more jobs each month leave our shores from every part of Tweeting about 800 jobs you saved is not a remanufacturing policy. That is not an economic policy. We are going to hold the President-elect accountable for a real policy to stop jobs from leaving this country, not just one half of one plant, not just one tweet, even if Republicans in Congress oppose it.  Similarly, tweeting ``very smart'' to Vladimir Putin for ignoring American sanctions is not foreign policy. America does not conduct foreign policy by tweet, least of all by flattering Putin after our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia interfered in our election.  Conducting foreign policy by tweet while spurning vital intelligence briefings that lay out the real emerging threats around the world should alarm Democrats and Republicans alike. It is utterly amazing that our Republican colleagues who have spent years lambasting President Obama for not being tough enough on Putin are now, with a few rare exceptions, utterly silent on this and so many other issues.  The President-elect must be held accountable on both sides of the aisle. On January 20, we will not be on reality TV; we will be in reality. We Democrats will make sure government works[[Page S10]]for every American in reality, not just on TV and on  So to those who wonder what the Democratic minority will do in the 115th Congress, the answer is simple: We will fight for our principles, we will fight for our values, and we shall fulfill our solemn constitutional duty to hold the other branches of government accountable.  To the extent that the President-elect and the Republican majority pursue policies that help America and are consistent with our values, we stand ready and willing to work with them. But if they propose policies that will hurt America, deny health care, cut their benefits, unleash irresponsible Wall Street risk-taking at the expense of consumers, their efforts will crash and break apart like waves upon the rocks of the Senate minority. That is our challenge. That is our charge. We rise to meet it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Barrasso).

10053,topic-id,1846,"Mr.President, I am here to join so many of my colleagues to oppose efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Outright repeal without a replacement plan will hurt hundreds of thousands of people in New Hampshire as well as millions across this country. The estimate is anywhere from 20 million to 30 million people who will lose their health insurance coverage.  There are all kinds of reasons why this is a bad idea. Many of those have been addressed by my colleagues very eloquently. I wish to speak about a couple of those reasons.  The first is one Senator Durbin alluded to earlier; that is, what repeal of this law will mean for the heroin and opioid epidemic that is facing New Hampshire and so many States across this country. Repeal will dramatically worsen that epidemic because it will deny treatment for people who are abusing substances, and it will also deny them access to mental health services. That will mean a surge in overdose deaths, and it will reverse so much of the progress we are beginning to make.  I understand that sweeping health care reform is not easy. We all know the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. It needs work. The way to address it is not to repeal it, it is to work together to make it better. Rather than rush to destroy the Affordable Care Act with no replacement in sight, we should be working together, on a bipartisan basis, to make commonsense improvements to the law. It can be done. I know, because Tim Scott and I worked together to pass the PACE Act last year to make it easier for us to control health care insurance increases and to allow States to make the determination about group size for health insurance plans.  One of the things I am hopeful about is that President-Elect Trump, in the course of many visits to New Hampshire over the last year, again and again pledged to take robust action to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across Yet, by repealing the Affordable Care Act, President-Elect Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress will make the opioid crisis so much worse. This would be a broken promise to communities all across this country that are struggling with addiction.  The Affordable Care Act has given millions of Americans access to treatment and recovery and saved countless lives, and repealing it would deny treatment to people suffering from substance use disorders. It will cost lives. It will take a terrible toll on communities across  In New Hampshire alone, health care reform has helped over 100,000 people gain access to health care coverage--people like Keith from Rindge, Keith was one of the thousands of Granite Staters able to access quality, affordable health insurance through our State's Medicaid expansion program.  Keith told my office that the Medicaid expansion literally saved his life. Keith was suffering from several health issues when he went to see his doctor after he signed up for the New Hampshire Health Protection Plan, which is what we call our expansion of He told us that had he not had insurance, doctors likely would not have caught his kidney cancer early like they did, but because he had that health insurance, Keith was able to afford and quickly access treatment for[[Page S144]]his cancer. He is thankfully now cancer-free, and he credits having insurance through Medicaid expansion with saving his life.  As I said, New Hampshire is in the midst of a heroin and opioid epidemic. We have talked about the grim statistics frequently in the last year as we have come to the floor. In 2014, we lost 47,000 Americans due to heroin and opioid overdoses. In New Hampshire, when all of the analysis is in for 2016, we are expecting to have lost almost 500 people due to overdose deaths. As Senator Durbin pointed out, we have one of the highest percentages of overdose deaths in the country.  It doesn't have to be that way because addiction is an illness. It is an illness that doesn't have a cure, but we have made progress in treating it. The Affordable Care Act ensures that substance misuse services are covered by insurance. As a direct result of the Affordable Care Act, many of those suffering finally have access to counseling and therapy like medication-assisted treatment.  In addition to covering substance misuse counseling, the Affordable Care Act is also built on mental health parity provisions that require group health plans and insurers offering coverage of mental health services to provide comparable coverage to what they provide for other medical care when it comes to substance misuse.  The Affordable Care Act extended these parity goals by requiring mental health services to be covered as essential health benefits, and it also helped expand access to these services by insuring more patients.  We worked very hard, in a bipartisan way, over the last year in this Chamber to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and to pass the 21st Century Cures Act that provided $1 billion to address heroin and opioid problems in this country. Both of those bills provide significant benefits to people who are suffering from substance misuse. If we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to undo all of the progress we have made through these supplemental pieces of law because it would reverse the treatment access so many people in New Hampshire and across this country have. Why would we deliberately take away access to this lifesaving treatment from so many people who are struggling to overcome addiction?  Repealing the Affordable Care Act will affect people like Ashley Hurteau of Dover, who said her access to health care as a new Medicaid enrollee was critical to her addiction recovery. She told our newspaper, the Union Leader: ``I am living proof that, by giving individuals suffering with substance use disorders access to health insurance, we, as a society, are giving people like me the chance to be who we really are again.''  I had the opportunity last Friday to visit a program called Hope on Haven Hill in Rochester, It provides help for women with substance misuse issues who are pregnant or who have just delivered babies. It works because these young women are enrolled in our Medicaid expansion program. Without that, they would lose any opportunity for treatment for their substance misuse. When I visited them, they talked about what it was like to be in a place where it was like a home, where people wanted to help them so that they could provide a better life for themselves and their children.  Without access to lifesaving addiction treatment, many people like Ashley and like those young women at Hope on Haven Hill would succumb to their addiction. Again, what is so frustrating about this situation is that it is completely preventable. It is not only the right thing to do, but it is the economic thing to do because the cost of failing to provide treatment for people who have substance misuse disorders is to make sure that they cannot become profitable, taxpaying members of our society.  One other benefit of the Affordable Care Act that, as Senator Murray said, is so critical to 50 percent of our population is access to health care for women. Before the Affordable Care Act, women paid more for health insurance, and contraceptives were something that made insurance cost more. Particularly for women who don't have the economic means, the Affordable Care Act has, for the first time, made contraceptives available to women without cost-sharing requirements like copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. Study after study has shown that access to contraceptives is one of the greatest indicators of success for women. When women are able to plan their pregnancies, they are more likely to graduate from high school, to enroll in college, to have stable and higher paying jobs, and to make sure that their health outcomes are better for themselves, their children, and their families.  It is especially frustrating that last week our Republican colleagues in the House leadership announced that they are going to use the budget processes not only to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the help that it provides to women for contraceptive coverage, but they are also going to use this vehicle to defund Planned This is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous.  Just this morning, Senator Hassan and I visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in Exeter, We talked with women who have benefited from the vital services this center provides to thousands of Granite They talked about how 94 percent of the services provided in New Hampshire Planned Parenthood clinics are related to prevention. This is what one of the volunteers said in talking about the women with whom she had met who had come to Planned Parenthood clinics: What they tell me is that Planned Parenthood saved me.  For so many women who have economic challenges, for low-income women who need access to services in New Hampshire and across the country, they don't have any other place where they can get services if we close down Planned Parenthood clinics. Two counties in New Hampshire don't have community health centers and a place where women can readily go. So defunding Planned Parenthood, closing the doors to Planned Parenthood health centers--in New Hampshire and across this country--would put millions of women in a situation where they have nowhere to go to access basic health care services. This will cost women and their families access to preventive care, and, ultimately, it is going to cost the lives of women.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act is going to actively worsen health outcomes. It will provide less access to care for our most vulnerable populations. It will increase unplanned pregnancies. It will mean that people who have preexisting conditions will not be able to access health insurance in the future. The list goes on and on. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act will not only throw millions of people off their health care, but it will also impact the coverage of millions of others because millions of Americans will see their premiums rise. They will see reinstatement of lifetime limits. They will see reinstatement of expensive cost-sharing requirements, higher deductibles, a reinstatement by health insurance companies of coverage denials, or sky-high premiums because of preexisting conditions. Why would we go back to those exclusionary and detrimental practices? Why would we go back to a time when we had over 20 million fewer people in this country who had access to health insurance?  Now is the time for us to come together. Instead of scrapping this law, we should be working together to improve it, to make it work for all  Make no mistake, repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan, stripping away health insurance for tens of thousands of Granite Staters and over 20 million Americans is not only counterintuitive but it is dangerous.

I have grave concerns with this effort. Our agenda here should be working on behalf of our constituents to protect their privacy and give them, not their service providers, data security. Instead, this effort would eviscerate any real online privacy protections and would limit data security.  Some of my colleagues have claimed that this commonsense rule has created challenges for consumers. I have found just the opposite. My office has been inundated with calls demanding that Congress protect their privacy and data security by opposing S.34. To everyone who has called, I hear you and I stand with you in opposing this harmful and misguided effort.  Back at home in New York's capital region, I have been hearing from many people who are frightened by the thought that S.34 will become law and the last shred of their online privacy will be lost forever.  They know how much information their internet service provider has mined from their search and browsing history, including financial, medical, and other very personal and sensitive details. They rightly believe that they should have a say in when that information can be bought and when it can be sold.  They understand that gutting these privacy protections would mean that internet service providers could sell their private information without their permission. It means their private internet browsing and search history, the text of their emails, and their mobile app usage can all be sold without their permission.  They have a right to control what they search for, their financial information, their health insurance, and information about their children. They have a right to protect their Social Security numbers and the contents of their emails. These rights are enshrined in our  Privacy rules also require providers to use reasonable measures to protect consumers' personal information, a clear and commonsense standard that all who do business online should be required to uphold.  Finally, internet service providers must notify customers if hackers breach the system and may have access to their private data. With hackers from Russia and elsewhere running rampant across the net, this is a critical provision for our American families.  This is not too much to ask. The American people deserve to know that their data will be protected and that they will be notified if their data is compromised.

10055,topic-id,1642,"Mr.President, I rise, along with Senator Warren and my other colleagues this evening, to oppose this action by President-Elect Trump and congressional Republicans to take health care away from tens of thousands of New Mexicans.[[Page S146]]  Let me be clear. What President-Elect Trump and Republicans are doing now will throw health care into chaos. It is reckless. It will hurt thousands of New Mexicans and millions of The worst part is, the Republicans have no plan to replace care they will take away.  The Affordable Care Act is not a perfect law. I have always said we should work to improve it. It has helped thousands of people in my home State of New Before we passed the Affordable Care Act, New Mexico had a high rate of people without health insurance. It was one of the highest in our region and in the country. Since 2010, that number has gone down 44 percent--pretty incredible.  Countless people have written me, called my office, and stopped me on the street to tell me how relieved they are to have health care. Others tell me we can't afford to go back to having insurance companies in charge, we can't go back to caps on coverage, back to allowing corporations to deny care because of a preexisting condition, and back to lifetime limits.  Tonight I want to share what just a few of my constituents have told me.  ``Save my daughter.'' That was the heartbreaking plea that came to me from one of my constituents, Kevin from Kevin's 33-year-old daughter Amber has multiple sclerosis. It is a tough disease, as we all know.  To treat her MS, Amber must follow an exact and rigorous drug regimen, coupled with regular visits to her neurologist and annual The retail cost of her drugs is $60,000 per year. Her doctor visits and MRIs would run into the thousands of dollars.  Amber works. In fact, she has a good-paying job, but her employer does not provide health insurance. Amber purchases health insurance through the individual open market without Affordable Care Act subsidies. Amber is able to work because she gets the medical care she needs through insurance. Kevin fears his daughter will lose the right to health insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. The ACA makes it illegal for an insurance company to deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition such as  The Affordable Care Act provides assurance that Amber will get the coverage she needs to remain healthy, to lead a normal life, to work, to contribute to society, and to stay off public assistance, and to survive. This one provision protects an estimated 861,000 New Mexicans and an estimated 134 million It is a safe bet that all of us here know at least one person like It isn't surprising that the vast majority of Americans--close to 70 percent--want to keep this protection.  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates more than one-quarter of all adults under age 65 have health problems and that could make them uninsurable without the Affordable Care If President-Elect Trump and the Republicans get their way, all of this will be at risk. Kevin is also scared because the cost of treating Amber's disease is so high. Without the ACA, any insurance company could cut off her health coverage if her medical expenses exceeded the company's lifetime limit. This provision protects an estimated 550,000 New Mexicans and an estimated 105 million  People who need medical care the most, people with serious medical problems, have some of the highest medical costs. If President-Elect Trump and Republicans have their way, care for people like Amber would be wiped away. I am the father of a daughter, and I am angry this father has to worry about whether his daughter will get the medical care she needs to live a healthy and productive life.  Let me tell you about Pam and They are a husband and wife from They own a small business. They signed up for an insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act as soon as they could because premiums before the ACA were too expensive and Pam had a preexisting condition. Using their new preventive care, they found out that Mike had an aggressive form of cancer. Thankfully, doctors caught the cancer at an early stage. Mike was treated at the New Mexico Cancer Center and is now cured. Pam says there is no question that the ACA saved her husband's life.  Because of the ACA, private health plans must cover a range of free preventive services--everything from cancer screening to flu shots. Over 730,000 New Mexicans now benefit. Discovering a disease early saves lives and reduces health care costs, but preventive care is expensive if you are uninsured or poor.  An overwhelming majority of Americans--83 percent, in fact--support making preventive health care free. What would President-Elect Trump and Republicans do to make sure Pam and Mike and millions of others can keep getting cancer screenings? They have no plan. They talk but no plan.  Next, I want to tell you about Karen from Albuquerque, the mother of two college-aged children. Karen's son graduates next May and turns 23. She is worried he will not get health insurance for an entry-level job. Her concern is well-founded since young adults have the lowest rate of access to employer-based insurance. Young adults do get sick, and one in six has a chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes, or asthma. Karen wants her son to have medical care if he needs it.  Today, the ACA allows him to stay on her insurance policy until he turns 26. This is one of the ACA's most popular provisions. The vast majority of Americans--85 percent--want young adults to be able to get insurance, but President-Elect Trump and congressional Republicans would leave an estimated 15,000 New Mexicans, like Karen's kids, and an estimated 2.3 million Americans without coverage because they have no plan to replace the Affordable Care  New Mexico is not a wealthy A lot of working people qualify for New Mexico wisely adopted the Medicaid expansion under the ACA, allowing 82,000 more people to get health care. Before the ACA, the only place many New Mexicans could get health care was in the emergency room. Now many are scared that President-Elect Trump and Republicans will take their health care away.  Take Amy, her husband, and her four boys--ages 13 to 19. Amy and her husband own a family business in Sante Before the ACA, they went without health insurance because they couldn't afford it. They just hoped nothing catastrophic happened to them. As soon as she could, Amy applied for health insurance under the Medicaid expansion. It covers her, her husband, her oldest son. Amy says she is grateful that because of the ACA, medical bills will not ``drain us financially.''  There are 8.4 million people across this country like Like Amy, many are low-income workers. They have jobs but no health insurance. They couldn't afford health insurance before the ACA, and they will not be able to afford it if President-Elect Trump and congressional Republicans have their way and repeal it with no plan to replace it.  These hard-working Americans deserve good medical care. Americans agree. Eighty percent favor the Medicaid expansion for low-income, uninsured adults.  Finally, we have 19 pueblos--Indian pueblos--and 4 tribes in New Native Americans make up more than one-tenth of our population. As vice chair of this body's Indian Affairs Committee, I represent all of Indian Native Americans are eligible to receive care through the Indian Health Service, but it is severely underfunded.  Long delays are common. As a result, many tribal members rely heavily on Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA health exchanges. More than 132,000 tribal members are enrolled in Medicaid in New Mexico alone. The All Pueblo Council of Governors, which represents all 19 pueblos, tells me, without the ACA, more tribal members will go back to the days of long delays, many will see their coverage cut.  This is also the subject of an amendment I will be offering. Indian Health Services' hospitals are heavily dependent on third-party collections for clinical services. In fact, current Federal funding covers less than half of their operational costs. Fortunately, increases in revenue from the Medicaid expansion have offset those annual costs. But without that revenue, necessary services may no longer be available throughout Indian country. This is unconscionable. My amendment would protect the Indian Health Service from any cuts in Federal funding if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.  There are tens of thousands of stories in New Mexico like those of Kevin,[[Page S147]]Pam, Mike, Karen, and Over 360,000 New Mexicans have gained health care since the Affordable Care Act was passed, and over 21 million Americans have health insurance because of I have heard from New Mexicans who are terrified because there is no plan to replace the Affordable Care Act's protections, benefits, and rights.  Republicans have called to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act for years. They have had years to figure out how to replace it, and they have not. They have no plan. Repeal and replace is not a sound public policy. It is only a sound bite.  Health care is a basic human right. Providing adequate medical care for everyone should be our guiding principle for health care policy. What is the guiding principle of repeal and replace? Act now; figure it out later.  I have said it before: The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it was historic--the biggest expansion of health care since the 1960s. It has helped millions of Americans get care. Many of them now can see a doctor regularly for the first time ever.  We need to work to improve, not repeal the Affordable Care  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

10102,topic-id,566,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise today in strong support of H.66, a resolution to protect retirement savers.  During the final days of the Obama administration--in fact, the final hours--the Department of Labor created a regulatory loophole that threatens the retirement security of working families. We are here today to use Congress' authority under the Congressional Review Act to close that loophole by blocking a misguided regulation from taking effect.  The regulation paves the way for States to force certain employers to automatically enroll their employees into government States would be allowed to skirt Federal law and deny workers important protections designed to safeguard their retirement savings.  The Obama administration's action is somewhat perplexing. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, has enjoyed strong bipartisan support for decades. As President Ford said when he signed the law, the American people have ``greater assurances that retirement dollars will be there when they are needed.'' Yet, over 40 years later, the same administration that frequently touted the importance of consumer protections moved to exempt States from                              {time}  1430  The question is why. To facilitate the creation of government-run plans that[[Page H1210]]would lack basic protections for retirement savers? As a result, workers and retirees would have nowhere to turn if their savings were mismanaged.  Let's be honest about what this regulation is really about. It is part of an assault on small business retirement plans that began under the Obama administration. First, small businesses were hit by the fiduciary rule that would make it harder for them to access the financial advice they need to set up retirement plans for their employees. Then the Obama administration created a last-minute regulatory loophole that could discourage small businesses from offering retirement plans in the first place. As a result, many families could soon realize, If you like your 401(k) plan, you may not be able to keep it.  Because of this loophole, taxpayers also are at risk. Many of the States leading the charge on these government-run plans have a long history of mismanaging public employee pensions. Today there is an estimated $5 trillion in unfunded State pension promises--$5 trillion. That figure is completely unsustainable. It begs the question: Will taxpayers or retirement savers foot the bill if these government-run IRAs are similarly mismanaged?  However, we are not here today to debate the merits of State policy. To be clear, States should be free to experiment with new retirement options, and more options are certainly needed. It is up to the voters in each State to hold their elected officials accountable. The point of this debate is that States should not be exempt from a law that has, for decades, provided important protections for retirement savers. If States want to come up with new ways to help workers save for retirement, they can. But they should follow the law in the process.  The goal of this resolution is simple. It is to uphold protections Congress--including Members of both parties--have long afforded retirement savers. Today we can close a regulatory loophole that would be detrimental to the retirement security of hardworking Americans, and we can ensure retirement savers in every State continue to have the same protections under Federal law. I urge my colleagues to support strong protections for retirement savers by voting in favor of H.66.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

February 13, 2017.       To the Members of the United States Congress: The      undersigned organizations, representing thousands of      businesses, express our support for H.66 and H.     67, resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional      Review Act (``CRA'') to invalidate the Department of Labor's      (``DOL'') ``safe harbor'' regulations on Savings Arrangements      Established by State and Political Subdivisions for Non-     Governmental       These ``safe harbor'' regulations allow states and cities      to mandate private employer participation in state-sponsored      automatic IRA programs. It also provides that states that      offer these programs are not subject to ERISA despite      considerable opinions to the contrary. Thus the DOL is      encouraging state and local governments to provide private      sector employees retirement programs that do not have the      same high-level protections as other private employer-     sponsored plans.       Below we highlight a number of our concerns with the ``safe      harbor.''       Lost worker protections--States offering these plans to      private sector employees are not subject to ERISA, therefore      limiting the protections for workers in these plans.       Different standards from state to state result in an      administrative quagmire for employers--States can and will      have different rules for their programs, so employers      operating in multiple states, or just with workers from      multiple states, will have to track the complex web of      varying rules to ensure compliance.       Fewer employer plans, especially among small businesses--If      a state mandates auto-IRAs, some employers will decide to      avoid taking on the work of offering their own plans and let      the state take it on instead, resulting in the loss of      significant retirement savings opportunities for their      workers.       Mismanagement of state pension funds--Many states have      mismanaged their public employee retirement systems, and it's      not clear they'll do a better job controlling assets of      millions of small private sector savers. Also, some state      pension funds restrict investments to favor state initiatives      or engage in politically motivated investment and divestment      schemes instead of investing in the economic interest of the      workers.       Imposes a mandate on private employers--The ``safe harbor''      requires that the state program mandate employer      participation even though retirement savings plans are      traditionally voluntary.       We urge Congress to take timely action under the CRA to      vitiate these misguided regulations. We thank you for      addressing this important issue.

Yet, now, when we stand with great concern because of a midnight rule that was put through that takes away the security of retirees in programs that will be, as I said earlier, foisted upon employers to automatically enroll their employees into government-run IRAs--allowing the same States to skirt the Federal law of ERISA--and deny workers important protections, we are pushed back on.  I have some concern about that. When the opportunity to do what they say they want to be done could have been done with both Houses under control of the same party and the White House, this was not undertaken. Yet we are called out and told that we are hurting retirees when, in fact, we are giving assurances to retirees that you will come under the same protections regardless of where you go, and we expect that to be the case because it has worked. That is decried. I find that less than objective in its honesty.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1206.txt,1855,OBAMACARE,2017.0,15.0,February

It is good for the opportunity to make it very clear that retirement security is a significant challenge facing this country. We have said that. I am glad that on the floor of the House today both sides of the aisle indicated concerns for that. Far too many men and women are struggling to save for their retirement years.  Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen regulations like the fiduciary rule that will make it harder for low- and middle-income families to save for retirement. And we have seen a regulation that would strip away important protections for retirement savers.  As policymakers, we must do more to expand retirement options for workers. That is a given. That we can agree on. However, the regulatory loophole created by the Obama administration is clearly not the answer.  I want to remind my colleagues that this resolution does not prevent States from coming up with new retirement options for workers. That is not what this resolution is about, and simply reading it will assure you of that.  This resolution is about ensuring every American has strong protections for a secure retirement.

9821,topic-id,465,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their good work on this legislation.  As we increasingly rely on technology in nearly every area of our lives, one of Congress' most important responsibilities is to strike the right balance between protecting consumers' privacy while also allowing for private sector innovation and the new jobs and economic growth that accompany it.  The resolution before us today reverses overreaching, shortsighted, and misguided rules adopted by unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications These rules do little to enhance privacy, but clearly add a new layer of Federal red tape on innovators and job creators. This is exactly the type of government overreach that the Congressional Review Act was meant to stop.  The Federal Communications Commission, frankly, overstepped its bounds on many issues during the Obama administration, including privacy regulations. After stripping the Federal Trade Commission of its authority over the privacy practices of internet service providers, ISPs, the FCC adopted shortsighted rules that only apply to one part of the internet. Despite the FTC's proven case-by-case approach to privacy enforcement that, frankly, has protected consumers, while simultaneously allowing ISPs to innovate, the FCC opted to abandon this model in favor of an approach that assumes the Federal Government knows best what consumers want.  Simply put, the rules that the FCC applied to ISPs are illogical. The regulations would require companies to apply the same privacy protections to consumer data, regardless of its importance or sensitivity. It hardly makes sense to treat a local weather update and personal financial information the same way.  In addition, the FCC's approach only protects consumer data as far as the internet service provider is involved. An entirely separate set of rules applies to providers of edge services. That means the giant search corporations, one of which controls up to 65 percent of your searches on the internet, don't live by the same set of privacy rules as your small town  What America needs is one standard, across-the-internet ecosystem, and the Federal Trade Commission is the best place for that standard.  The impact of these rigid regulations has the potential to stifle one of the most innovative sectors of our Nation's economy, and it is consumers who will suffer. These rules, which Congress will repeal, only lead to higher costs, less competition, and fewer service offerings. This approach is particularly burdensome for small businesses, which do not have hallways full of lawyers to navigate these tedious and unnecessary rules.  The benefits of the FCC's privacy regulations are questionable, but the harms are certain, which is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And once these rules are reversed, the FCC can turn back to working together with the FTC to ensure that our privacy framework allows the internet[[Page H2493]]to flourish while truly protecting consumers.

Both parties agree it is unacceptable that men and women returning home from our most recent conflicts don't have good, reliable jobs waiting for them. We can start right here in the Federal The VA establishes long-term contracts with private companies for medical equipment, construction, supplies, services, and more.  Currently, the VA gives preferences to veteran-owned small businesses. That is great. What this piece of legislation does is expand this contracting preference to allow the VA Secretary to give a preference to companies that actively search out and employ veterans, a policy that would incentivize companies to even hire more veterans. This is already a smart approach for those companies because veterans bring to a job the skills they have learned over the years and make the company even stronger.  This bipartisan piece of legislation adds no cost to the taxpayers. It allows for debarment of any company that knowingly misrepresents its portion of veteran employees in order to receive the contracting preference.  The BRAVE Act represents a win-win for the private sector, the Federal Government, and, most importantly, for our veterans.  Again, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice), who will tell us a little more about this in a few moments, and Chairman Roe of Tennessee and Vice Chairman Bilirakis for continuing to bring good pieces of veterans legislation to the floor.

Miss Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.974, the Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, which I introduced along with Congressman and Colonel Paul Cook of  The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will authorize the VA Secretary, when awarding Federal contracts, to give preference to contractors with high concentrations of full-time veteran employees. This bill will cost taxpayers absolutely nothing.  It will, first, reward companies that actively hire and invest in our veterans, companies that seek out veterans and give them opportunities to bring their unique skills, training, and experience to the civilian workforce.  Second, it will create an incentive for other companies to do the same and bring more veterans into their workforce.  Most importantly, as more and more companies hire more and more veterans, they will ultimately see that investing in veterans is good for business. That is the real incentive here. It is not just an advantage in securing Federal contracts; it is getting the benefit of employees who have worn the uniform, who have been trained by the greatest military in the world, and who have learned to get the job done, no matter what that job is.  We need more businesses in the private sector to recognize the value of investing in the men and women who have served our country. It is not an act of charity. Veterans are not looking for a handout; they just need an opportunity. The BRAVE Act will help ensure that more veterans have those opportunities.  I want to thank Chairman Roe of Tennessee, Vice Chairman Bilirakis, and Ranking Member Walz for supporting this bill and for helping to bring it to the floor today.

10054,topic-id,1455,"Mr.President, for 8 years Republicans have complained about health care in They have blamed everything in the world on President They have hung out on the sidelines, name-calling, making doomsday predictions, and cheering every stumble that they could blame on someone else. They spent a lot of energy rooting against families who needed help paying for health insurance or who wanted coverage but were frozen out because of preexisting conditions. They jeered and carried on. But what they didn't do--ever--was lift a finger to try to improve health care[[Page S145]]in But they are in charge now. They get to call the shots.  So what is the first thing on the Republican agenda now that they are in control? Is it working to help improve health care in America, working to bring down premiums and deductibles, making fixes to expand the network of doctors and the number of plans that people can choose from--any of those? No, the very first thing on the Republican agenda in the 115th Congress is to shatter health care in The first thing is to rip health insurance out of the hands of millions of Americans who need it. The first thing is to massively raise the cost of health insurance for everyone who has it. The first thing is to create chaos for hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies, and send their costs spiraling out of control. The first thing is to abandon the people they were elected to represent. The first thing is to repeal and run away.  Republicans have been rushing around Capitol Hill for the past couple of weeks, huddling in meetings and trying to come up with a plan to replace the Affordable Care They are shocked--shocked--to discover that guaranteeing Americans access to health care is a complex business, and they don't have any good ideas.  Now, after 8 years of complaining, they are trying to convince each other that it will all be OK if they just repeal health care access, with nothing to replace it. They are trying to reassure each other that they know what they are doing.  Get real. They don't have a clue what to do next. For 8 years they have had no plan, and they don't have a plan now.  Let's be very clear about what is going on here. Republicans want to tear apart our Nation's health care system--a health care system that protects kids with cancer, protects women getting mammograms, protects independent contractors, protects new moms, protects college kids, protects grandparents, protects disease survivors, and protects so many of America's families. They want to tear it apart, and they don't have the first clue what to do with it afterwards. Repeal and run, that's the Republican plan.  In Massachusetts, we know how important health reform is because we have been working on it now for years--long before the Affordable Care Act was even a spark on the horizon in  My Republican colleagues could learn a lot from our work in In Massachusetts, the belief that everyone should have access to affordable health insurance coverage is a shared value that Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, hospitals, insurers, doctors, consumers, and advocates have all worked to implement over the past decade. It is not just the lip service we are hearing right now here in It is real commitment, and, because of it, in Massachusetts we got real results.  Just because we are all behind this effort together in Massachusetts doesn't mean that health care reform has been a cake walk. Finding ways to cover more people and bring down costs, all while improving the quality of care, is a tough job. You have to be in it for the long haul. That is why, in Massachusetts, we didn't just pass one health care law in 2006 and then just run away. We came back a couple of years later with additional legislation to make fixes and adjustments. We formed commissions to study how things were working and to make recommendations for more changes. We passed amendments. We revised our regulations where they needed to be changed to support implementation. We worked to make coverage more affordable. We set standards to make sure insurance is a good value. We invested in prevention programs to keep people healthy in the first place. We got more coverage for more people, and we lowered health care costs.  We kept working month after month, year after year because we knew what it meant for a family to have the peace of mind that comes with affordable, high-quality health insurance coverage. We kept working because we knew it was the right thing to do. We kept working because we knew that is what Massachusetts residents expected us to do. Once we started something, we had to see it through. When it got tough, we worked harder. We didn't repeal and run.  When the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, Massachusetts went all in. We expanded our Medicaid program. We used Federal funds to cover people who still lacked insurance even after our State reforms. We set up a State health insurance exchange, the Health Connector, and we combined Federal and State dollars to make sure that insurance was truly affordable.  Just 2 months ago, we signed an ambitious new Medicaid agreement with the Federal Government that will allow us to set up innovative partnerships among health providers, insurers, and community organizations so we can better serve Medicaid patients in our  We have a great deal to be proud of in More than 97 percent of our citizens are insured. People have coverage. They have good coverage--coverage they can afford. This wasn't something we got done overnight, but it is something we worked at, and it is something we can achieve in every State if we are willing to do the work.  Democrats and nonpartisan government officials have worked for years here in Washington to try to make this health system work, and we have made real progress. Now Republicans in Congress are ready to throw away these years and years of progress. They are ready to threaten the collapse of our insurance markets. They are ready to threaten the health and the safety of millions of Americans simply to make a political point. They are ready to repeal and run.  In Massachusetts, right now, families are watching this debate, and they are worried about what happens to them. Kids with diabetes and moms with cancer are worried. Hospitals and insurers are watching, too, and they are worried--worried about an irresponsible Republican Party that is more interested in political stunts than in helping Americans get access to health care.  I don't blame them for being worried because this isn't a game. There is no magic replacement plan that will suddenly make everything all better. In Massachusetts, we can't just snap back to our old health insurance system if Republicans decide to rip up the Affordable Care Other States across the country are also facing the terrifying prospect that they will be left high and dry as a result of the Republicans' reckless actions.  Every Senator here has ideas about how to improve health care in America, but no Democratic Senator will vote to destroy it today based on the vague assurance that maybe at some point Republicans might think up some kind of replacement plan later on. The Republicans' strategy is repeal and run. Repeal and run. That is not governing. That is not leadership. It is one of the most reckless and irresponsible things that has ever been proposed in this I know some Republican Senators agree with that. I know they are worried about whether this is the right move forward, given all that hangs in the balance. I hope their consciences get the better of them and they scuttle this plan before it is too late. I hope they remember that every single Senator who votes to destroy health care in America will be responsible for the disastrous consequences that come next.  If Republicans actually want to improve health care in America, let's talk about how to do that. That is what we were sent here to do. That is what voters--conservative and liberal, Republican and Democratic--expect us to do. If Republicans want to destroy health care in America, I will fight them every step of the way. The stakes are too high for the millions of Americans whose futures are about to be sacrificed so one party can make a political point.

9964,topic-id,535,"Mr.President, whenever the discussion in the Senate turns to gun violence, we often hear Senators say: We shouldn't be talking about guns; we ought to be talking about mental health. That is exactly what we are trying to make sure is the focus of this debate because this proposed rule is about mental health, and it is about background checks; it is not about taking away anyone's constitutional rights.  Here is how the proposal works. If there is an individual with a severe mental impairment--that means that another person, perhaps a family member--is in charge of their Social Security benefits, then the background check is to be informed by Social Security that the person with a severe mental impairment is ineligible to buy a gun.  Having listened to the debate yesterday, I think everybody is going to be a little confused about what happens then because the reality is that anyone who thinks they have been unfairly affected can appeal, and the likelihood is substantial that they are going to win. If the appeal goes the other way and the individual believes the decision is wrong, then that person can take the matter to court. It is not true to say this rule deprives any American of due process. It is a rule aimed directly at the two areas in this debate--mental health and background checks--where there is enormous support from the American people.  The reality is you can talk to people in virtually any community--you can go to a townhall meeting in any part of the United States--and you will hear enormous support for background checks. One recent poll found that 92 percent of gun owners supported expanded background checks. Ninety-two percent of gun owners supported background checks. So not only is the position I am articulating not extreme, opposing background checks is the position that, in fact, has become increasingly out of the mainstream.  As the courts continue to interpret the language of the Second Amendment, one matter has been clear: Background checks are a constitutional part of the exercise of those rights.  I have heard some saying that the rule can be improved, that it ought to be tailored. I am very open to having a debate around those kinds of questions. That is not going to be possible if this resolution passes. This will preempt debate. The resolution doesn't just scrap the rule, it blocks any further step on this issue for years. In my view, that would be the wrong way to go, even if you have suggestions for improving the rule.  So to wrap up the debate, I want colleagues to know that this rule, this proposal that has been described on the floor--this resolution--ought to be opposed because for those who want improved mental health, for those who want background checks, for those who are just saying what we need to do in this area as it relates to gun violence--it is not about Democrats and it is not about Republicans; it is about common sense. The commonsense position today for background checks, a focus on mental health, and, most importantly, common sense is to oppose the resolution.  I yield the floor.

10034,topic-id,969,"Madam President, I am very pleased to be able to join Senator Donnelly, Senator Hirono, and Senator Blumenthal on this extraordinarily important issue that goes right to the heart of what we want health care to be in this country. I have always felt that the really big issues, the really important issues, need to be bipartisan. You need to find a path to some common ground.  As Senator Donnelly and our colleagues have pointed out, what is being discussed now is an inherently partisan process for dealing with one of the most sensitive and most important issues of our time; that is, Medicare and what it represents. I had a chance to listen to Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono discuss this issue. It made me recall my days when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, the senior citizens group. I was director of the group for almost 7 years before I was elected to This was back in the days when I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks.  We always talked about Medicare being a promise. It was a promise of guaranteed benefits. They were going to be there. They were going to be secure. They were going to be defined. In effect, all who supported Medicare said they would oppose unraveling that promise, unraveling that pledge of guaranteed benefits. It seems to me, without strong legislation, the kind of legislation my colleagues are advocating, we are putting that promise at risk.  I think when you look back at the history of what was available for older people before Medicare, you would see why this promise and this pledge is so important. For so many older people, there was, essentially, what amounted to poor farms. We had one not far from where we lived at home in When Medicare was being debated, people brought out those pictures. They talked about what it meant, in a country as strong and good and rich as ours, for older people not to have a life of dignity and security and decent health care.  When Medicare was adopted in 1965, it was all about the promise. It was all about the guarantee. That is what Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono are standing up for as part of this debate. I know that some who don't share our view are going to say: Well, there are tremendous challenges with respect to There is no question about that--10,000 people turning 65 every day for years and years--but there is so much that can be done, Democrats and Republicans, if you want to reject something that is partisan like reconciliation and come together. You can come together around updating the Medicare guarantee. I say this to my friends Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono, who have done such good work on this.  We are not saying there aren't any challenges. The fact is that Medicare today in 2017 is very different than Medicare when it began in 1965. It is dominated by chronic illness: cancer, diabetes, heart disease. But we can come up with fresh, practical approaches for dealing with those challenges, consistent with what Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono are talking about, which is keeping the Medicare promise, keeping the Medicare guarantee, not allowing the program to be privatized.  We started on that with the Affordable Care There were a number of us in the Senator Isakson was very involved. At the time, Senator Markey was a Member of the other body. We advocated for something called Independence at Home, which allowed the Medicare Program to begin to take care of those with chronic illness at home.  So I am very appreciative of what Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono are doing because what they are saying is this: Instead of gambling on the health of older people with a partisan reconciliation process, let's work in a bipartisan way to build on the promise of Medicare, the promise of those guaranteed benefits.  We can do that. We can do that by creating more options for caring for older people at home. We can do it by expanding telemedicine and using new technology. We can do it by creating more opportunities for nonphysician providers. These are all ways that we can build on the Medicare promise and the Medicare guarantee and deal with the challenges of our time. But we are not going to be able to deal with those challenges through partisan approaches like reconciliation that would privatize the program and unravel the promise.  So I am very pleased to be able to have a chance to be out on the floor with my colleagues who have been strong advocates for Medicare, who rightly put this issue front and center in the debate, because I think a lot of what is being discussed is really getting lost. A big part of this debate really seems to be about creating a Trojan horse to give tax cuts to some of the most fortunate, while, in effect, raising health care costs for millions of others and breaking the Medicare promise, which is what my colleagues are seeking to protect in their amendment 20.  We are going to be talking more about this. Certainly, as the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, we will be having significant debates about these issues in the committee. But I am very appreciative that Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono have allowed us to jump-start what this debate is really all about; and that is, keeping the promise of Medicare, keeping the promise of guaranteed benefits, working in a bipartisan way to update the guarantee to deal with chronic illness and improve options for home care.

I am going to take a few minutes as well to describe it. I am very pleased our colleague Senator Murray is here because she has really led the effort--and I have been very pleased to join her--in terms of trying to promote expanded health care services for vulnerable women in  I say to Senator Murray, I saw there was a comment made by some who advocate the repeal of the Affordable Care They said: Nobody was going to get hurt--nobody in America was going to get hurt. The reality is, that is not true for the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of women who depend on Planned Parenthood for basic health care, for preventive health services, for essential services, for example, like cancer screens.  So this notion that somehow nobody is going to get hurt by repealing the Affordable Care Act is simply contradicted, from rural Oregon to rural Maine, when you see the kind of pain and suffering this is going to end up generating for some of the poorest and most vulnerable women in our country. The fact is, what has been set in motion by Republicans here in the Senate is a scheme that I call repeal and run. It is about very large tax breaks for the most fortunate, paid for by taking health insurance away from millions of working people. Under it, the insurance companies are back in the driver's seat, health care costs skyrocket across the board, and that is true even for those who get their insurance at work.  The replacement plan our colleagues on the other side have promised for years is somehow hidden away, with tens of millions of Americans in the dark about what is coming next for their health care.  Whenever I hear about the replacement, the whole notion of what would be there for families in the future, it reminds me of what used to be the old movie house in town. It had a big marquee up at the top of it, and it would always talk about the movie ``coming soon,'' but the movie never actually got there. When I hear about the replacement, what I think about is that everybody is going to be sitting in the dark again.[[Page S140]]  What is essentially at stake here is whether America is going to go back to the days when health care was for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what health care used to be all about. If you were healthy, no problems, nothing to worry about. If you were wealthy, you could just write out checks when you had a whole host of preexisting conditions.  What the Senate is going to vote on this week is whether to green-light the first step in this scheme to go back to the days when health care was for the healthy and wealthy with a budget resolution.  I think it is fair to say budget resolutions usually aren't the prime topic at dinner table conversations in America, but this year there are serious consequences--serious consequences--personal, life-and-death consequences because of this scheme that is being pushed through the That is where I believe the focus ought to be and why I am going to spend the remainder of my time talking about persons whose lives in Oregon are going to be directly affected and, in some cases, endangered.  Maleta Christian is from Douglas County, OR, a beautiful rural community. She is a personal support worker, providing care to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. She had always carried health insurance until she was unexpectedly laid off from her job. She was without coverage for more than a year, but then she was able to buy a plan through the Affordable Care  For Maleta, having insurance meant cancer screenings that, very likely, saved her life. Doctors found tumors that had to be removed. Later, she was diagnosed with a degenerative hip and back problems that caused her pain every day, making it difficult to get through a physically demanding and grueling job.  Her prescription drug coverage, which she gets through a plan under the Affordable Care Act, is what makes it possible for Maleta to get up every morning and get through that workday. Thanks to the care she has received, Maleta made it to her daughter's wedding, and she was proud that she even baked the cake.  Another Oregonian, Rita from Salem, comes from a family who has been struggling with depression. It is a condition that has been stigmatized for far too long in this country.  I know something about this because my late brother, Jeff, faced the stigma of mental health. He was a schizophrenic, and he passed at far too early an age. Far too many of those with mental illness have been denied care and shunted to the fringes of society.  Before Rita got coverage through the Affordable Care Act, she was forced to pour a staggering share of her income into health-related expenses. It was nearly two-thirds in 2011. Even then, she didn't have access to the mental health treatments she needed. Her depression used to keep her out of work.  With coverage from the Affordable Care Act tax credits that made it affordable, Rita's costs have fallen substantially. She now gets the prescription and therapy that help her manage her condition, and she can live a healthier life.  Another of my constituents is Mary, who lives in Milwaukie, OR, with her husband and 7-year-old daughter. She has a hereditary disease known as It is a rare genetic condition that causes dangerous swelling, lasting days at a time, affecting various parts of the body. If Mary goes without treatment, attacks come on regularly, even multiple times a week. When they do, it is completely disabling.  Before she got insurance through the Affordable Care Act, she rotated through health plans and insurers to maintain coverage and avoid hitting caps on treatments. She sought out clinical studies to get free care, typically participating in one each year.  So on top of holding down a job, raising a daughter, battling a life-threatening condition that affects 1 in 50,000 Americans, she was basically out trying to cobble some decent health care together. The system was so badly broken, she basically sewed her own health care safety net, but the ACA protected patients like Mary from discrimination and guaranteed access to care.  These are three They come from different backgrounds, and they have battled different conditions, but they share a lot in common with each other and with people around the land.  Not long ago, in the eyes of insurance companies, the women who I just mentioned would have worn their preexisting conditions like scarlet letters. But the insurance they have now gives them the opportunity for healthier, more productive lives, and that is what is endangered because of the scheme that is being pushed through Congress, pushed through the Senate by Republicans right now.  Costs are going to shoot up if the plan goes forward. The premium subsidies millions of Americans count on to buy insurance could be eliminated. Even if Americans with preexisting conditions have access to health care after this repeal scheme goes through, it doesn't mean they can afford it.  What my colleagues on the other side have said repeatedly for years is that they were going to repeal and replace--no gap, no harm done to anybody. The replacement would be ready on day one.  It sure looks as though that promise is going to be broken. The replacement is still hidden somewhere, but the process of repeal is rolling forward. In the meantime, millions of Americans are left guessing what is going to happen to their care if this plays out.  The bottom line for me and my colleagues is really this. If Members on the other side want to debate how to solve this country's health care challenge, we will have that debate.  I would say to my colleagues on the other side: I have spent about as much time as anybody here in this body looking for bipartisan approaches to address health care. So let's find ways to bring down costs for families. Let's make prescription drugs more affordable. Let's uphold the promise of Medicare because that is what it is; it is a promise of guaranteed benefits. But we are not going to be able to do that on a partisan scheme called the budget resolution and reconciliation. That is not about bringing people together for a bipartisan effort. That is about tearing things down, tearing down the Affordable Care Act, so I want that understood.  My colleague Senator Murray is here. She and I work together closely because of our committees. We feel very, very strongly about how uniquely important this time is because this is a time when our country has to decide not to go back to the dark days when health care was reserved for the healthy and wealthy. That is what the other side has on offer right now. It is a proposition that my colleagues and I are going to fight with all our strength.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.
