              AMERICANS ARE THRIVING BECAUSE OF TAX REFORM

  (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share just a few 
examples of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already helping businesses 
in Georgia's Third District. It is helping them to grow, and it is 
helping them to reinvest in their workers.
  Last month, I had the opportunity to visit such a business, Custom 
Truck and Body Works, in Woodbury, Georgia. This is a unique company 
that builds specialty vehicles for first responders. Because of the 
changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this small business has been 
able to hire new workers, is beginning a facility expansion, and, in 
fact, told me they are still looking for folks to fill positions today.
  This isn't the only business in the Third District that is thriving 
because of tax reform. Another small business, Shred-X, which is a 
small business that has 10 employees and provides recycling and 
shredding services to 3,000 clients throughout Atlanta and west central 
Georgia, plans to use the additional savings to buy a new truck and 
potentially hire a new employee. For a company of 10 people, this is a 
huge difference.
  Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to see our Main Street job creators 
thriving because of tax reform, and I look forward to seeing our 
economy continue to thrive as Americans reap the benefits of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act.
