                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month, as well as all of the men, women, and 
families that have been affected by this devastating disease.
  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. 
Research, early diagnosis, and modern treatments are raising survival 
rates, but it remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality for 
women.
  During the month of October, we reflect on the lives lost and the 
families affected by this cancer, including my own family and my own 
beautiful wife, Carol, who we just lost this last spring, but we also 
bring light to the actions that we can take to fight against it.
  I encourage all women to talk to your doctor about breast cancer 
screenings for early detection.
  I admire the unmatched courage of the survivors and those currently 
suffering from this disease.
