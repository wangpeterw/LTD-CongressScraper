         TAX REFORM AND CUTS TO THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise against H.R. 1, the so-
called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and its effects on our veterans.
  H.R. 1 would cut the successful work opportunity tax credit, a 
Federal credit available for employers to incentivize them to hire 
veterans.
  In 2016, there were 453,000 veterans that were unemployed 
nationwide--16,000, alone, in Virginia.
  Mr. Speaker, today, on their behalf, I call on my Republican 
colleagues to find solutions that do not sacrifice those who have 
sacrificed enough.
  House Republicans have suggested that the work opportunity tax 
credit, at a cost of $1 billion, is simply too expensive to keep in 
place. However, I cannot help but wonder why the same is not said about 
repealing the estate tax, a $269 billion tax cut for the wealthy.
  My Democratic colleagues and I are taking a different approach by 
founding the Reinvesting in Our Returning Heroes Task Force. Instead of 
hurting, we are helping veteran businessowners and veterans who need 
jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, my father is buried in Arlington. He was a Korean war 
veteran. He said that the American GI only asked of his country what he 
was prepared to give, and that is his best.
  Mr. Speaker, this tax cut is not our best.
