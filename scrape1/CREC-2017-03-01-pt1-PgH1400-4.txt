                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We use this moment to be reminded of Your presence and to tap the 
resources needed by the Members of this people's House to do their work 
as well as it can be done.
  Send, O God, Your healing grace upon those torn nations and upon the 
Members of this assembly who struggle to see the shared hope for a 
better future in those with whom they disagree.
  For many Americans, the holy season of Lent begins tomorrow, and 
foreheads are marked this day in recognition of our limits as men and 
women and as a reminder of Your power to forgive and heal the harms 
done through our failures.
  All this day and through the week may our Representatives do their 
best to find solutions to pressing issues facing our Nation. Please 
hasten the day when justice and love shall dwell in the hearts of all 
peoples and rule the affairs of the nations of Earth.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
