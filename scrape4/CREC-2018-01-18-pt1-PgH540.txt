                      IMPENDING SHUTDOWN AND DACA

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
the midst of yet another looming government shutdown and an impending 
nightmare for DREAMers created by those who run Washington.
  Republicans control the House, the Senate, and elected the great 
negotiator in the White House, yet here we are again. It is time they 
come to the table in good faith to provide our Nation fiscal certainty 
and lay down their threats against DREAMers in this country, those who 
were brought here as children and live as upstanding members of 
communities across our Nation. Our priority should be strengthening 
American families, not ripping them apart.
  Just this week, as we have all seen on the news, ICE officials 
forcefully deported Jorge Garcia, a 39-year-old man from Michigan with 
a wife and kids. He has lived in this country almost his entire life 
and made an honest living after being brought here as a child. He has 
hardly a parking ticket on his record.
  I call on the President and my Republican colleagues to work across 
the aisle in good faith and lead for the good of our Nation rather than 
their political base.
