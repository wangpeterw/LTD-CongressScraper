                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the most 
aggressively progrowth tax reform package passed since the Reagan 
administration.
  Each day, we learn about a new business giving a substantial bonus to 
its employees, increasing wages, or reinvesting into their communities 
because of tax reform. Today, ExxonMobil announced that they would 
invest an additional $50 billion in the United States due to this law. 
Many Arizonans are seeing the benefits from businesses such as Boeing, 
Waste Management, and Arizona Public Service, just to name a few.
  According to Americans for Tax Reform: ``At least 3 million Americans 
are receiving special tax reform bonuses.'' These successes are taking 
place long before tax reform has even

been implemented fully. Most Americans have yet to learn how much more 
money they will see in their paychecks.
  Mr. Speaker, tax reform has placed us on the right course to keep our 
booming economy humming at a good clip and sets the trajectory for even 
more significant growth in the future. I predict a very prosperous new 
year.
