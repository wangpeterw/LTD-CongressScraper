                             GIVING THANKS

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give thanks. I give thanks 
to the people of California's 44th District for giving me the honor and 
the privilege to serve them.
  My district is rich with immigrants. My own mom, who turned 76 today, 
is an immigrant from Mexico who came here with a third grade education 
so her kids could have a shot at the American Dream.
  In my district, only 10 percent of students go on to college. I am 
grateful to be one of those 10 percenters who beat the odds and got a 
piece of the American Dream.
  But those numbers are unacceptable. I pledge to fight for them to 
make sure everyone, regardless of income, immigration status, or race 
has a shot at the American Dream.
