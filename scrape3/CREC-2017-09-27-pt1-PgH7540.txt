                             MUSLIM BAN 3.0

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage toward 
the latest travel ban proposed by the Trump administration again late 
on September 24. The administration issued a proclamation with new 
discriminatory travel restrictions on eight countries.
  Let me be clear: no matter how many times this administration tries 
to repackage it and sell it, a Muslim ban is a Muslim ban. It remains 
hateful, discriminatory, and goes against our American values. We won't 
be fooled by the inclusion of North Korea and Venezuela.
  This Muslim and refugee ban continues to be part of a dangerous and 
immoral agenda against a religion, people of color, and immigrants.
  This administration and this ban is fanning the flames of fear and 
anger against groups of Americans and immigrants, with policies that 
clearly undermine the Constitution that I love and our American 
principles.
  Dressed up or dressed down, this ban must not stand.
  We must address terrorism, and it is not restricted to the Muslim 
population. We must address it here on the ground in homegrown 
terrorism as well.
