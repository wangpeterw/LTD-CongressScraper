                       PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY

  (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, as vice chair of the Seniors Task Force, I 
rise in strong defense of Social Security. Recent reports that the 
White House is considering defunding Social Security and cutting Social 
Security disability benefits are troubling, to say the least.
  Nearly 61 million retirees, veterans, disabled workers, widows, and 
children rely on their Social Security, including over 186,000 in my 
district in Florida alone. On their behalf, I have a simple message: 
Hands off their Social Security.
  President Trump promised the American people he would not cut Social 
Security. That is a promise we are going to help him keep.
  Hands off Social Security.
