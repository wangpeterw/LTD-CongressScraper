                        HONORING ALBERT O. ORTA

  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the recent passing of the father of my 
district director brings me to the floor today to speak about the 
extraordinary career of Albert O. Orta and his selfless service to our 
Nation.
  He began his career in the U.S. Air Force at Lackland Air Force Base 
in 1947, where he became an expert on radar and communications 
equipment. In 1949, he married Mary Louise Guerrero, which resulted in 
12 children, 31 grandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren.
  Mr. Orta was a busy man, but he also served his country after leaving 
the U.S. Air Force. He became an expert in radar engineering and 
communications, working on the B-29, B-36, B-47, and B-52, as well as 
fighter jets F-84, F-86A, F-89, F-102, and F-106.
  His outstanding accomplishments and his willingness to serve our 
Nation faithfully and to the best of his abilities brought him praise 
from President Jimmy Carter and a host of generals all around this 
Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues and the United States House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Albert O. Orta for his 
distinguished career and his proud service to our country.
