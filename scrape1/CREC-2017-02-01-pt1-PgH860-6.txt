     SCALING BACK BURDENSOME REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE OBAMA 
                             ADMINISTRATION

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, this week, House Republicans have 
undertaken the effort to scale back some of the burdensome regulations 
implemented by the previous administration.
  The use of so-called midnight rules to slip in regulations at the 
last minute and without congressional approval was a favorite tool of 
the last President. Many of these regulations would negatively impact, 
and have, American people by destroying their jobs, hamstringing our 
economy, often for no good reason.
  That is why, at the very start of the 115th Congress, we passed the 
Midnight Rules Relief Act, which utilizes the Congressional Review Act, 
to allow Congress to review multiple midnight rules en bloc.
  Additionally, we now have the unique opportunity to utilize the CRA, 
Congressional Review Act, and express our disapproval for some of these 
harmful, burdensome regulations that hurt jobs and stunt the economy, 
in order to protect the American people from these harmful effects.
  The regulatory state has been rapidly expanding in recent years for 
too long, and I am happy to see that Congress is taking action to 
reverse this destructive behavior.
