  AMY, VICKY, AND ANDY CHILD PORNOGRAPHY VICTIM ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2017

  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 293, S. 2152.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2152) to amend title 18, United States Code, to 
     provide for assistance for victims of child pornography, and 
     for other purposes.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, 
which had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with 
amendments, as follows:
  (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in boldface 
brackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in 
italics.)

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child 
     Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2017''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because 
     it drives production, which involves severe and often 
     irreparable child sexual abuse and exploitation.
       (2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not 
     end, with child sex abuse because child pornography is a 
     permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those 
     images compounds the harm to the child.
       (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court 
     recognized that ``every viewing of child pornography is a 
     repetition of the victim's abuse''.
       (4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of 
     Children has stated that for victims of child pornography, 
     ``the sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that 
     abuse which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent 
     distribution and viewing become psychologically intertwined 
     and each compound the harm suffered by the child-victim''.
       (5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result 
     of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals 
     have viewed and will in the future view images of their 
     childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason 
     that child pornography is outlawed.
       (6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who 
     reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a 
     victim's childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining 
     and aggravating the harms to that individual victim. Multiple 
     actors independently commit intentional crimes that combine 
     to produce an indivisible injury to a victim.
       (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child 
     pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting 
     from every perpetrator who contributes to their anguish.

[[Page S472]]

     Such an aggregate causation standard reflects the nature of 
     child pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms 
     victims.

     SEC. 3. DETERMINING RESTITUTION.

       (a) Determining Restitution.--Section 2259(b) of title 18, 
     United States Code, is amended--
       (1) in paragraph (1)--
       (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting ``Except as 
     provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and
       (B) by striking ``as determined by the court pursuant to 
     paragraph (2)'' after ``of the victim's losses'';
       (2) by striking paragraph (3);
       (3) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and
       (4) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:
       ``(2) Restitution for trafficking in child pornography.--If 
     the defendant was convicted for trafficking in child 
     pornography, the order of restitution under this section 
     shall direct the defendant to pay the victim (through the 
     appropriate court mechanism) an amount of restitution 
     determined by the court as follows:
       ``(A) Determining the full amount of a victim's losses.--
     The court shall determine the full amount of the victim's 
     losses that were incurred or are reasonably projected to be 
     incurred by the victim as a result of the trafficking in 
     child pornography.
       ``(B) Determining a restitution amount.--After completing 
     the determination required under subparagraph (A), the court 
     shall enter an order of restitution against the defendant in 
     favor of the victim in an amount which is [not less than 
     $3000 and not greater than 1 percent of the full amount of 
     the victim's losses when the full amount of a victim's losses 
     are greater than $300,000.]  between $3,000 and 1 percent of 
     the full amount of the victim's losses.
       ``(C) Termination of payment.--A victim's total aggregate 
     recovery pursuant to this section shall not exceed the full 
     amount of the victim's demonstrated losses. After the victim 
     has received restitution in the full amount of the victim's 
     losses as measured by the greatest amount of such losses 
     found in any case involving that victim that has resulted in 
     a final restitution order under this section, the liability 
     of each defendant who is or has been ordered to pay 
     restitution for such losses to that victim shall be 
     terminated. The court may direct the victim to provide 
     information concerning the amount of restitution the victim 
     has been paid in other cases for the same losses.''.
       (b) Additional Definitions.--Section 2259(c) of title 18, 
     United States Code, is amended--

     suitable by the court,'' the following: ``may assume the 
     crime victim's rights under this section,''; and

     2260(a), or any offense under chapter 109A or chapter 117 
     that involved the production of child pornography, as defined 
     in section 2256.
       ``(2) Full amount of the victim's losses.--For purposes of 
     this section, the term `full amount of the victim's losses' 
     includes any costs incurred, or reasonably projected to be 
     incurred in the future, by the victim, and in the case of a 
     trafficking in child pornography conviction, as a proximate 
     result of all trafficking in child pornography offenses 
     involving the same victim, including--
       ``(A) medical services relating to physical, psychiatric, 
     or psychological care;
       ``(B) physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation;
       ``(C) necessary transportation, temporary housing, and

     one of the offenses listed in this section is charged as part 
     of a series of offenses] (in cases in which the series of 
     felony violations exclusively involves violations listed in 
     this section), or section 2260(b) [)].''.
       (c) Clerical Amendment.--Section 1593(b)(3) of title 18, 
     United States Code, is amended by striking ``section 
     2259(b)(3)'' and inserting ``section 2259(c)(2)''.

     victim's election.--
       ``(A) Election to receive defined monetary assistance.--

be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The committee-reported amendments were agreed to.
  The bill (S. 2152), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a 
third reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:

                                S. 2152

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child 
     Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2017''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because 
     it drives production, which involves severe and often

       (2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not 
     end, with child sex abuse because child pornography is a 
     permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those 
     images compounds the harm to the child.
       (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court

       (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child 
     pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting

     an aggregate causation standard reflects the nature of child 
     pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms 
     victims.

     SEC. 3. DETERMINING RESTITUTION.

       (a) Determining Restitution.--Section 2259(b) of title 18, 
     United States Code, is amended--
       (1) in paragraph (1)--
       (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting ``Except as 
     provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and
       (B) by striking ``as determined by the court pursuant to
