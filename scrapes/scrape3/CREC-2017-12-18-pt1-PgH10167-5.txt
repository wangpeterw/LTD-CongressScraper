                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Members of the House 
will cast a vote on the tax conference committee report, the final 
version of the Republican tax plan.
  The Republican leadership rushed this bill to the finish line at the 
expense of small-business owners and working families. I strongly urge 
my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  As a former small-business owner, I understand firsthand the 
importance of tax simplification. Unfortunately, this bill does the 
opposite: it complicates our Tax Code while giving companies fewer than 
2 weeks to adjust before it goes into effect. This creates serious 
uncertainty for small-business owners who create jobs and invest in our 
communities.
  I support reforming our Tax Code, but I ask my colleagues to stop 
rushing this process and to put working families first. There is simply 
too much at stake.
  We can simplify our tax system without exploding the national debt 
and spiking healthcare premiums. For the sake of our economy and our 
future, we need to kill this bill.
