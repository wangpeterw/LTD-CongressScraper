                             LET'S GET REAL

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, $1.5 trillion--no, I guess it is actually 
closer to $2.3 trillion with interest--that is the amount this partisan 
tax reform plan plans to add to our debt and deficit.
  I have had a few folks say: ``Well, we have had $10 trillion added to 
the debt over the last 8 years.'' With all due respect, Republicans 
controlled Congress during 6 of those 8 years.
  Where are my conservative Republican friends who railed for 8 years 
on the deficits? Was that just while a Democrat was in the White House? 
Are we such shallow, political, hypocritical people that we now ignore 
the greatest threat to our country, our national debt and deficit, just 
because a Republican is in the Oval Office?
  Furthermore, the idea that we will grow our way out of that $2 
trillion hole is fantasy. Let's look at the growth rate after the last 
big tax cut at the end of 2015.
  Since we have passed that tax cut, the growth rate remains steady at 
1.5 to 2 percent, no change, that huge tax cut financed with $650 
billion in debt to our kids.
  The Wharton School of Business, not exactly a liberal bastion of 
theology, now estimates that growth factor from this tax reform bill to 
be less than 1 percent.
  Let's get real. Vote against this package. Let's do real tax reform 
that is deficit neutral at least--for our kids' sake.
