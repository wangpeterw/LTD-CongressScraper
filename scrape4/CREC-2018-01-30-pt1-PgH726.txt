                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. After consultation among the Speaker and the 
majority and minority leaders, and with their consent, the Chair 
announces that, when the two Houses meet tonight in joint session to 
hear an address by the President of the United States, only the doors 
immediately opposite the Speaker and those immediately to his left and 
right will be open.
  No one will be allowed on the floor of the House who does not have 
the privilege of the floor of the House. Due to the large attendance 
that is anticipated, the rule regarding the privilege of the floor must 
be strictly enforced. Children of Members will not be permitted on the 
floor. The cooperation of all Members is requested.
  The practice of purporting to reserve seats prior to the joint 
session by placement of placards or personal items will not be allowed. 
Chamber Security may remove these items from the seats. Members may 
reserve their seats only by physical presence following the security 
sweep of the Chamber.
  All Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in still 
photography or audio or video recording in the Chamber. Taking 
unofficial photographs detracts from the dignity of the proceedings and 
presents security and privacy challenges for the House.
