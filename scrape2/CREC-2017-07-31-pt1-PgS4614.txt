                        TRIBUTE TO MARIDI CHOMA

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Maridi for her hard work as 
an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize her efforts and 
contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Maridi is a native of Casper, WY. She currently attends the 
University of Wyoming, where she is studying international studies and 
French. She has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made her an 
invaluable asset to our office. The quality of her work is reflected in 
her great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Maridi for the dedication she has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of our team. 
I know she will have continued success with all of her future 
endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.
