            RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today because the American people 
have the right to know the truth regarding Russia's interference in our 
democratic process.
  I am a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and the message 
I hear from our military leaders is consistent: Russia is a top threat 
to the United States and our interests.
  Russia has not only used its military to destabilize regions around 
the world, but it has completely undermined and disrupted the 
democratic values of this country.
  This is unacceptable. And yet my colleagues from the other side of 
the aisle refuse to do their job as an oversight body and establish a 
bipartisan, independent commission to investigate Russia's egregious 
behavior.
  We have a responsibility to be transparent with the American people. 
I strongly urge my Republican colleagues to not only immediately 
establish an independent investigation into Russia's interference in 
our election, but I also call for the release of President Trump's tax 
returns.
  America's security and values are on the line. Any treasonous and 
unlawful relations with Russia cannot be tolerated.
