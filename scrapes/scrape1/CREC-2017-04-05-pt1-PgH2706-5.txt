           HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF DEPUTY CLINT GREENWOOD

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor the life of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy 
Constable Clint Greenwood.
  On Monday morning, Chief Deputy Greenwood was tragically murdered as 
he arrived to work at the Baytown, Texas, courthouse. Chief Deputy 
Greenwood was a respected and committed 30-year law enforcement veteran 
of the Houston area.
  My heartfelt prayers go out to Chief Deputy Greenwood, his family, 
and the entire law enforcement community.
  After yet another intentional killing of a Texas law enforcement 
officer, we must do more to end the continued violence and hate-filled 
rhetoric directed at our brave law enforcement officers. We hope for a 
quick apprehension of the evil perpetrators and an answer to why.
  I stand in strong solidarity with the law enforcement community and 
offer my deepest condolences to all those impacted by the senseless 
murder of Chief Deputy Greenwood.
  Rest in peace, Brother Clint Greenwood, and may God bless your family 
and all those who wear the uniform.
