          RECOGNIZING THE RAVALLI COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing 
the Ravalli County Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Stephen Holton for 
their work to prevent an attack on the students and teachers of Darby 
School District.
  Just last week, on the heels of 17 tragic murders in Parkland, FL, a 
Darby High School senior allegedly made threatening comments and social 
media posts directed at fellow students and faculty at Darby High 
School. After receiving information about the concerning threats, 
Sheriff Holton took action, and law enforcement arrested the student on 
felony charges.
  While we will continue to investigate the tragedy in Florida and the 
performance of law enforcement in that incident, it is important that 
we commend students who speak up, school officials who respond, and 
those law enforcement officers who bravely act to keep our communities 
safe. The Darby students and school officials did the right thing.
  Sheriff Holton and the quick response of students and school 
officials may have prevented a tragedy in Montana, and for that, we are 
very grateful.
