                  CORPORATE TAX CUT SHOULD BE REJECTED

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, New York State contributes $41 
billion, annually, to the Federal Government in taxation. The House 
Republican corporate tax bill cut is being funded by tax increases on 
middle America and on western New York.
  The elimination of the State and local tax deduction would be a major 
hit on local taxpayers. In fact, in Erie County, 89 percent of middle-
income households claimed the State and local tax deduction in 2015, 
deducting $1.6 billion in already-paid local taxes. The average State 
and local tax deduction in Erie County was $12,866.
  This corporate tax cut is being funded by tax hikes on middle America 
and on western New Yorkers and should be rejected.
