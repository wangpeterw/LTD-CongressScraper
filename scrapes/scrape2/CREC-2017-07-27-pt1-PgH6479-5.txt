                     OPPOSE FUNDING FOR BORDER WALL

  (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, Americans don't want to pay a single dime of 
Federal money to pay for the President's wall.
  During the Presidential campaign, this was a very provocative claim, 
and he said Mexico would pay for it.
  So why does the defense appropriations bill have a blank check for 
this wall?
  I, like so many of my colleagues, including Republicans, know that 
this wall is unnecessary and environmentally catastrophic.
  It will require us to seize property through imminent domain. It is 
ineffective, just like Homeland Security Secretary Kelly has said.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose funding for this ill-gotten wall, to 
vote against the rule before us today, and begin to work on an honest 
conversation about the types of immigration reform that our country 
needs.
