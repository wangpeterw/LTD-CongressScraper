                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all You have done for us. 
We thank You for the splendor of creation, for the wonder of life, and 
for the mystery of love. We thank You for work that demands our best 
efforts and for the satisfaction of a job done well.
  As our lawmakers strive to please You in working to fulfill Your 
purposes, inspire them with Your Spirit to glorify You in their 
thoughts, words, and actions. Lord, endue them with courage and 
loyalty, whether their duties are large or small. Give them an eternal 
perspective on the myriad issues they face.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
