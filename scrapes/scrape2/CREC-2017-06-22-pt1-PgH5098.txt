  LET'S WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR 
                             EVERY AMERICAN

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
Republicans' ongoing plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care 
Act. Senate leadership unveiled their plan this morning and plans a 
vote as soon as next week.
  This bill was drafted in secrecy and will have massive consequences 
for the healthcare of every American. It will affect more than one-
sixth of our economy. Yet for all its impact, it was written behind 
closed doors, with absolutely zero bipartisan input.
  I have heard from more constituents on this issue than any other--
more than 5,000 letters, emails, and telephone calls: people like the 
cancer survivor in Lake Bluff who is worried whether she will be unable 
to find affordable insurance without the ACA's preexisting condition 
protections; or my constituent in Grayslake, who says he could only 
start his business because of the individual coverage he bought on the 
exchange.
  I urge my colleagues to listen to the great majority of the American 
people. It is time to end this ill-considered charade to repeal 
ObamaCare and work together in a bipartisan way to improve our 
healthcare system for every American.
