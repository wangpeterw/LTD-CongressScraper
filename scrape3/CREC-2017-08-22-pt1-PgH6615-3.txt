                                 PRAYER

  Reverend William Gurnee, St. Joseph's on Capitol Hill, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  O God most holy and kind, You revealed through the Psalmist Your 
desire that Your children find respite. You promised to be a shepherd 
to Your people by leading them to green fields and restful waters.
  The Members of this body need to spend time in their districts, and 
even more importantly, to rest with their families.
  In a special way, we humbly ask You to bring peace to our country so 
that agitation will cease and we will learn to listen to each other. 
Give to the men and women of Congress the courage to be resolute in 
their convictions, the strength to be steadfast in their mercy, and 
above all, to be certain in their knowledge that they have served their 
country well.
  Amen.
