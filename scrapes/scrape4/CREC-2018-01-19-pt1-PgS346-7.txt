                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS

  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:

       POM-156. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of Texas urging the United States Congress to 
     pass legislation or adopt policies allowing Texas to manage 
     the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery out to 200 nautical 
     miles; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
     Transportation.

                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 105

       Whereas, in recent years, the Gulf of Mexico has contained 
     the highest total allowable catch of red snapper in decades, 
     but in 2016, anglers experienced the shortest recreational 
     fishing season to date, lasting less than two weeks; and
       Whereas, the U.S. government has overseen the Gulf 
     recreational red snapper fishery for nearly four decades; 
     today, federal management systems attempt to regulate red 
     snapper fishing by the pound with tools specifically designed 
     to manage the commercial sector, despite the fact that 
     federal data collection systems are incapable of accounting 
     to such a level of specificity for recreational harvests; and
       Whereas, the U.S. government has, moreover, neglected to 
     use recent data to provide meaningful guidelines and 
     requirements for a systematic reallocation of federal 
     fisheries; except for minor adjustments to account for errors 
     in its own data collection system, the Gulf red snapper 
     fishery allocation is based on highly suspect data from 1979-
     1986 and has remained unchanged since 1991; and
       Whereas, the federal government is currently promoting a 
     management strategy to

[[Page S347]]

     privatize the Gulf red snapper fishery; approximately 50 
     percent of the fishery is already held by private businesses, 
     while another 20 percent has been designated to be sold; 
     shares of this public resource have also been given away for 
     free, based on a commercial operator's past catch history; 
     and
       Whereas, because of extraordinarily remiss requirements in 
     its conflict of interest guidelines, the federal fisheries 
     management system allows commercial operators who already own 
     red snapper shares or who may be gifted shares to serve on 
     the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and to cast 
     votes on issues that will result in direct financial benefit 
     for them; and
       Whereas, by creating a prohibitive environment for anglers 
     and ethical issues among user groups and stakeholders, the 
     U.S. government has proved itself incapable of properly 
     managing red snapper fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, and all 
     five states along the Gulf Coast have increasingly needed to 
     implement regulations and seasons that are not consistent 
     with the federal management plan; and
       Whereas, numerous studies, including some funded by NOAA 
     Fisheries, indicate that the greatest economic engine in the 
     Gulf reef fishery is the recreational angling sector, and 
     federal control should be relinquished to the Gulf states, 
     which depend most on this vital public resource: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the 85th Legislature of the State of Texas 
     hereby encourage Congress to pass legislation or adopt 
     policies allowing Texas to manage the Gulf of Mexico red 
     snapper fishery out to 200 nautical miles; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward 
     official copies of this resolution to the president of the 
     United States, to the president of the Senate and to the 
     speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States 
     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to 
     Congress with the request that this resolution be entered in 
     the Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the 
     United States of America.
                                  ____

       POM-157. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of 
     Michigan memorializing the celebration of the Republic of 
     China's (Taiwan) 106th National Day on October 10, 2017; to 
     the Committee on Foreign Relations.

                       Senate Resolution No. 103

       Whereas, Relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan) 
     and the United States are marked by strong bilateral trade, 
     education, and cultural exchanges. In 2016, bilateral trade 
     totaled more than $65.4 billion in exchanged goods, making 
     the U.S. the third-largest trading partner of Taiwan, and 
     Taiwan the tenth-largest trading partner of the United 
     States; and
       Whereas, Taiwan and the state of Michigan have long 
     benefited from this relationship. In 2016 Taiwan was 
     Michigan's sixth-largest market in Asia and Michigan exports 
     to Taiwan amounted to $298.59 million, a 20 percent increase 
     from 2015. From 2013 to 2016, Michigan imports from Taiwan 
     increased from $705 million to $867 million, a 23 percent 
     increase, making the outlook for joint economic and cultural 
     growth in the future bright: and
       Whereas, Taiwan is capable of and willing to fulfill its 
     responsibilities and to collaborate with the world to deal 
     with the challenges of humanitarian aids and disease control. 
     Taiwan's meaningful participation in international 
     organizations benefits the international community as a 
     whole, including the state of Michigan: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this 
     legislative body congratulate the government and people of 
     the Republic of China (Taiwan) on their 106th National Day on 
     October 10, 2017; and be it further
       Resolved, That we continue to support Taiwan's meaningful 
     participation in international organizations which impact the 
     health, safety and well-being of its people, and support its 
     aspiration to make more contributions in international 
     societies; and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to 
     the U.S. Secretary of State; the Taipei Economic and Cultural 
     Office in Chicago Illinois; and the members of the Michigan 
     congressional delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-158. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of 
     Michigan memorializing their opposition to violent terrorism, 
     totalitarian impulses, xenophobic biases, and bigoted 
     ideologies that are promoted by radical hate groups and 
     declaring these groups to be domestic terrorist 
     organizations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

                        Senate Resolution No. 82

       Whereas, The United States was founded on the principles 
     that all men are created equal and have the unalienable right 
     to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the more 
     than 240 years since this declaration, our nation has 
     strived, struggled, and made great progress toward achieving 
     these lofty ideals. Ending slavery, women's suffrage, the 
     civil rights movement, and marriage equality were all major 
     moments in our history where we recognized injustice and 
     inequality and worked to end it; and
       Whereas, White nationalist and neo-Nazi groups endorse 
     agendas that are in irreconcilable conflict with our nation's 
     foundational principles of liberty and justice for all. 
     Throughout the course of our nation's history, these groups 
     have promoted intimidation and violent repression of 
     individuals solely on the basis of their race, ethnicity, 
     religion, sexual orientation, or immigration status; and
       Whereas, Although white nationalism has attempted to 
     reinvent itself, self-identifying as the ``Alt-Right,'' its 
     present-day rhetoric and terrorism conjure painful memories 
     of our nation's past. Race-based hatred remains an integral 
     component of these groups' core orientations as they seek to 
     reignite social animosities, reverse improvements in race 
     relations, divide the nation, and provoke hatred, classism, 
     and ethnic eradication, and
       Whereas, The white nationalist and neo-Nazi message of 
     racial and social intolerance has led to senseless acts of 
     violence that terrorize members of ethnic and religious 
     minority communities. The tragic events that took place on 
     August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, prove that 
     white nationalism and neo-Nazism remain very real threats to 
     social and racial progress and peace in our nation, now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate, That we strongly denounce and 
     oppose the violent terrorism, totalitarian impulses, 
     xenophobic biases, and bigoted ideologies that are promoted 
     by radical hate groups and declare these groups to be 
     domestic terrorist organizations, and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to 
     the President of the United States, the Governor, and the 
     members of the Michigan congressional delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-159. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of 
     Michigan memorializing atomic veterans for their service and 
     sacrifice for our nation; to the Committee on Veterans' 
     Affairs.

                        Senate Resolution No. 73

       Whereas, Throughout the nation's history, brave Michigan 
     citizens have answered the call of duty and service, 
     defending our freedom as members of the United States Armed 
     Forces; and
       Whereas, As a result of the Manhattan Project, the United 
     States conducted the Trinity Atomic Test, the first 
     detonation of a nuclear device, in New Mexico on July 16, 
     1945; and
       Whereas, Over 200,000 American service members, including 
     those from Michigan, participated in aboveground nuclear 
     tests between 1945 and 1962, and veterans who participated in 
     the cleanup of the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands 
     between 1977 and 1980, and also those who were part of the 
     United States military occupation forces in or around 
     Hiroshima and Nagasaki before 1946, and some were held as a 
     prisoner of war during this time; and
       Whereas, These atomic veterans were exposed to radiation 
     during their military service and, due to that exposure, 
     developed several types of medical conditions that are not 
     currently listed under the Radiation Exposure Compensation 
     Act (RECA); and
       Whereas, Many atomic veterans were prevented by secrecy 
     laws or oaths from seeking medical care or disability 
     compensation from the United States Department of Veterans 
     Affairs (VA) for conditions they may have developed as a 
     result of radiation exposure; and
       Whereas, In 1996, the United States Congress repealed the 
     Nuclear Radiation and Secrecy Agreements Act, freeing atomic 
     veterans to describe their military involvement in nuclear 
     testing in order to file for VA benefits; and
       Whereas, Atomic veterans will now be eligible for free 
     medical care from the VA and compensation in the form of full 
     service-connected disability allowance, including payments to 
     a surviving spouse or children; and
       Whereas, The Michigan Veteran's Affairs Agency will provide 
     free assistance to Michigan veterans and their dependents in 
     developing and submitting disability compensation claims to 
     the VA and the Department of Justice for death benefits; and
       Whereas, The National Association of Atomic Veterans was 
     formed in 1979 to help atomic veterans obtain medical care 
     and assistance; Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this 
     legislative body find it proper and fitting that atomic 
     veterans be recognized for their service and sacrifice for 
     our nation and that they should be provided the necessary 
     medical services and compensation for their service; and be 
     it further
       Resolved, That we memorialize the United States Congress to 
     do all it can to support atomic veterans, their spouses, and 
     dependents in receiving medical care and disability 
     compensation; and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to 
     the National Associations of Atomic Veterans, the Michigan 
     Veteran's Affairs Agency, the Speaker of the United States 
     House of Representatives, the President of the United States 
     Senate, and the members of the Michigan congressional 
     delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-160. A resolution adopted by the Township Council of 
     Livingston, New Jersey, urging their delegation to the United 
     States Congress to oppose any proposal to eliminate the state 
     and local taxes deductibility provision from the Federal tax 
     code; to the Committee on Finance.
