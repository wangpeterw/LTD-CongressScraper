                  PREPARE FOR FUTURE NATURAL DISASTERS

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the first 
responders and utility workers, the linemen who have been vital in 
helping prepare for and recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
Maria.
  The road to full recovery will be a long one for many of us, our 
neighbors as well, who experienced catastrophic losses, and we must 
continue to support those in need.
  I encourage my constituents to visit my Facebook page to learn more 
about FEMA resources. I also believe now is the time to encourage all 
Americans to be properly prepared for future natural disasters.
  I have introduced the SHELTER Act, which would provide individuals 
and businesses with a tax credit for 25 percent of qualified hurricane 
and tornado mitigation property expenditures. It is $5,000 a year. So 
again, this tax credit, this bill will incentivize Americans to take 
action now in preparation for future disasters.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.
