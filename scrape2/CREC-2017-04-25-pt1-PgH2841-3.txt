               HONORING NANCY LOMBARDO ON HER RETIREMENT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Nancy Lombardo on her well-deserved retirement.
  Nancy is the executive officer for the Clearfield County League on 
Social Services in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District. For the 
past nearly 20 years, she has been instrumental in leading several 
programs that the league provides for the betterment of local 
communities.
  Nancy manages several programs, including Child Care Information 
Services of Clarion, Clearfield, and Jefferson Counties; Children 
First, which is a seminar for divorced parents to help cope with 
divorce and how it affects their children; Safe Haven, which provides a 
safe meeting place for custodial parents to have their children visit 
with the noncustodial parent; as well as the Child and Adult Care Food 
Program.
  Nancy has given her time to numerous boards to advocate for 
children's needs, day care services, child advocacy centers, children 
youth services, and more. She has been a valuable and dedicated leader 
to the league for many years, and she will be missed.
  On behalf of the Congress of the United States, I wish Nancy Lombardo 
all the best in her retirement.
