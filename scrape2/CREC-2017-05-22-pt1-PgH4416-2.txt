                        HONORING BRIAN C. COOPER

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Brian Cooper, 
who is retiring from the Office of the Parliamentarian after 35 years 
on Capitol Hill. Brian's first job came in 1982, when he was hired in 
the stock room of the Longworth Building working in Publication and 
Distribution Services.
  Since then, Brian held a variety of positions in Congress, where he 
learned the intricacies of the legislative process, and the inner 
workings of House operations--skills that earned him a job at the House 
Parliamentarian Office, where he currently serves as Chief Clerk. A 
consummate professional, Brian has spent his career committed to 
assisting with an orderly and accurate legislative process, observed in 
a fair and nonpartisan manner.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my congressional colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Brian Cooper on his long-deserved retirement and wish 
him all the best as he pursues his passions, including his artistic 
endeavors, traveling, spending more time with his family, and cheering 
on his favorite Baltimore sports teams.
  Bon voyage and Godspeed to Brian Cooper.
