   RECOGNIZING PENN STATE CREAMERY IN HONOR OF NATIONAL ICE CREAM DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennyslvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Americans 
observed National Ice Cream Day, which is celebrated annually on the 
third Sunday in July.
  In 1984, President Ronald Reagan made the designation and also named 
July National Ice Cream Month.
  Our very own Penn State University is a world leader in dairy 
production and food science. Over the last 150 years, its Berkey 
Creamery has been an important Penn State landmark.
  Penn State has a herd of more than 200 Holsteins that are milked 
twice daily, which is the start of the university's delicious ice 
cream. The methods developed by Penn State's food and dairy scientists 
have made the creamery a world authority on ice cream and dairy 
manufacturing.
  Penn State's legendary short course, which takes participants from 
``Cow to Cone,'' has attracted some of the biggest names in ice cream, 
from Baskin-Robbins to Ben & Jerry's, from Hershey's to Haagen-Dazs.
  For 6 days a year, industry professionals head to Happy Valley for 
the best-known program dealing with science and the technology of ice 
cream.
  Congratulations to Penn State for being the industry leader, and 
happy National Ice Cream Month.
