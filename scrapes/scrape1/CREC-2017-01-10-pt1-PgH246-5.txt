                       THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, this week kicks off the North American 
International Auto Show in Detroit. As a car guy all my life, I never 
missed the world's premier automotive event, the greatest show on 
Earth. This year there is plenty to celebrate.
  Just yesterday, Fiat Chrysler announced it would create 2,000 jobs 
and invest $1 billion to modernize manufacturing plants in Michigan and 
Ohio. Last week, Ford scrapped plans for its facility in Mexico and 
instead promised to invest $700 million at the Flat Rock plant. This 
move will bring 700 new jobs to Michigan. These are exciting 
developments for our State's economy and good paying jobs for our 
dedicated and talented workforce.
  Mr. Speaker, as everyone will see at this year's auto show, Michigan 
continues to lead the way in car manufacturing. Working together, we 
can keep Michigan on the forefront of innovation and mobility and keep 
making the best cars and trucks in the world right in our backyard, the 
motor capital of the world.
