           By Ms. KELLY of Illinois:
       H.R. 3433.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       US Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 3 (``The Congress shall have 
     Power To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among 
     the several states, and with the Indian tribes[.]'') (This 
     bill would amend federal crop insurance law to incentivize 
     farmers to grow more fruits and vegetables--thereby altering 
     the supply of crops, and therefore food prices) (Cf. Wickard 
     v. Filburn).
       US Const. Preamble; Art 1., Sec. 8, Cl. 18 ([T]o . . . 
     promote the general Welfare . . . The Congress shall have 
     Power . . . To make all Laws which shall be necessary and 
     proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.'') 
     (This bill promotes the general welfare of the United States 
     by expanding access to fresh produce in underserved 
     communities, while promoting crop diversity and therefore 
     farmer income).
