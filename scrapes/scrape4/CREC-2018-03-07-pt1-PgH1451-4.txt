   RECOGNIZING REPRESENTATIVE MARCY KAPTUR FOR WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Women's History Month 
and the resilient women who have challenged the status quo, I am 
honored to recognize my congressional colleague and dear friend, 
Representative Marcy Kaptur.
  In 1981, Marcy defeated the incumbent in an upset that gained 
national attention, leading her to become the longest-serving woman in 
the U.S. House of Representatives and a senior member of the powerful 
and highly coveted Appropriations Committee.
  I met Marcy during my first tenure in the House back in 1989, and at 
that time there were only 31 women serving in all of Congress. Marcy 
welcomed me with open arms, and I quickly realized that Marcy embodies 
what any legislator should be: principled, truthful, and a fierce 
fighter for her constituents.
  It was because of Marcy's vision and tireless advocacy that Americans 
from all over the country are now able to visit the World War II 
Memorial here in D.C. and honor the dedication and sacrifice of the 
brave men and women who defended our country.
  Marcy, you are an inspiration to women everywhere, and I want to 
thank you for your commitment to advocate for so many important issues 
that matter to all Americans. Congratulations on this honor, the 
longest-serving woman in U.S. history.
