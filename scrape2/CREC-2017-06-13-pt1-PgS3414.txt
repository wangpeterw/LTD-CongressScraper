    DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHISTLEBLOWER 
                             PROTECTION ACT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, now, on another matter, the House of 
Representatives will vote later today on the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, which 
would give the Department of Veterans Affairs more of the tools it 
needs to hold bad actors accountable. Last week, the Senate passed this 
bipartisan legislation on a voice vote, and once the House weighs in, 
the bill will go to the President's desk for his signature.
  Throughout our country, VA facilities have been plagued by widespread 
dysfunction. Our veterans deserve the timely and effective care they 
were promised, and I am committed to continue working with colleagues 
in Congress and in the administration to make sure they get it. This 
sensible approach has been a top priority of this Congress, and I am 
proud that we came together to continue addressing the problems in our 
VA system.
  Representing Kentucky veterans is one of the greatest privileges I 
have had as a Senator. Through their selfless service, America's 
veterans have earned our admiration and our gratitude. This legislation 
is just one example of how Congress and the administration are working 
to keep our commitments to our Nation's veterans.
  I would like to thank Senator Rubio and Chairman Isakson for their 
work on this measure on behalf of our Nation's veterans. I look forward 
to the House voting later today to send this bill to the President.
