 CONGRESS SHOULD REMAIN IN WASHINGTON UNTIL A HEALTHCARE BILL IS PASSED

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call upon the 
House leadership to not adjourn until we have a healthcare bill.
  Respective committees need to meet and walk a new product through 
regular order. We know what will and will not work, given the voting 
prerogatives of the Members of this body and the Senate.
  We understand the needs of our constituents, regardless of their 
voter registration.
  We understand it is our job to navigate the complexities of this 
issue on behalf of the American people and come up with a product that 
makes good on promises that have been made to improve our healthcare 
system. This will take Republicans and Democrats.
  Later this morning, I will be proud to once again gather with my 
colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, who are members of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus, part of no labels, to continue our work seeking 
a bipartisan solution to what has become, unfortunately, a partisan 
issue.
  I stand ready to make good on these promises and suggest that we 
remain in Washington until that work is complete.
