   SENATE RESOLUTION 77--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF MULTIPLE 
                        SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK

  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Markey, Mr. Coons, Mr. 
Menendez, Mr. Brown, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Van Hollen, Mrs. 
Capito, Mr. Moran, and Mr. Thune) submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to:

                               S. Res. 77

       Whereas multiple sclerosis (referred to in this preamble as 
     ``MS'') can impact individuals of all ages, races, and 
     ethnicities, but MS is at least 2 to 3 times more common in 
     women than in men;
       Whereas there are approximately 2,300,000 individuals 
     worldwide who have been diagnosed with MS;
       Whereas MS is typically diagnosed in individuals between 
     the ages of 20 and 50, but it is estimated that between 8,000 
     and 10,000 children and adolescents are living with MS in the 
     United States;
       Whereas MS is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of 
     the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of 
     information within the brain and between the brain and the 
     body;
       Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling to 
     vision problems and paralysis, and the progress, severity, 
     and specific symptoms of MS in any 1 person cannot yet be 
     predicted;
       Whereas, while there is no evidence that MS is directly 
     inherited, studies show that there are genetic and 
     environmental factors that give certain individuals a higher 
     risk of developing MS;
       Whereas the exact cause of MS is unknown, and there is no 
     cure for MS;
       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national 
     network of independent MS organizations dedicated to the 
     enhancement of the quality of life of individuals affected by 
     MS, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness 
     Week;
       Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is 
     to increase opportunities for cooperation and to provide 
     greater opportunity to leverage the effective use of 
     resources for the benefit of the MS community;
       Whereas the United States plays a critical role in 
     coordinating MS research globally and amplifies the impact of 
     research in the United States through which results are 
     delivered to MS patients;

       Whereas, in 2012, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society 
     was a founding member of the International Progressive MS 
     Alliance, which coordinates research to accelerate the 
     development of treatments for progressive MS by removing 
     international scientific and technological barriers and, as 
     of 2017, includes 16 MS organizations from 15 countries, 8 
     foundation and trust members, and 5 pharmaceutical partners;
       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and 
     supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March each 
     year;
       Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week 
     are--
       (1) to invite people to join the movement to end MS;
       (2) to encourage everyone to do something to demonstrate a 
     commitment to moving toward a world free of MS; and
       (3) to acknowledge those who have dedicated time and talent 
     to help promote MS research and programs; and
       Whereas, in 2017, Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is 
     recognized during the week of March 5 through March 11: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis 
     Awareness Week;
       (2) encourages States, localities, and the territories and 
     possessions of the United States to support the goals and 
     ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing 
     proclamations designating Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
       (3) encourages media organizations--
       (A) to participate in Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week; 
     and
       (B) to help provide education to the public about multiple 
     sclerosis;
       (4) commends the efforts of States, localities, and the 
     territories and possessions of the United States to support 
     the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
       (5) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United 
     States to ending multiple sclerosis by--
       (A) promoting awareness about individuals that are affected 
     by multiple sclerosis; and
       (B) supporting multiple sclerosis research and education 
     programs;
       (6) recognizes all individuals in the United States living 
     with multiple sclerosis;
       (7) expresses gratitude to the family members and friends 
     of individuals living with multiple sclerosis, who are a 
     source of love and encouragement for those individuals; and
       (8) salutes the health care professionals and medical 
     researchers who--
       (A) provide assistance to individuals affected by multiple 
     sclerosis; and
       (B) continue to work to find ways--
       (i) to stop multiple sclerosis;
       (ii) to restore what has been lost due to multiple 
     sclerosis; and
       (iii) to end multiple sclerosis forever.
