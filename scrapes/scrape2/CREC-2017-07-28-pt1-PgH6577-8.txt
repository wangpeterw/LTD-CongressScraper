           By Mr. GOSAR:
       H.R. 3531.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 (Spending Clause): ``The 
     Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, 
     duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for 
     the common defense.  .  .'' The United States has incurred 
     legal liability for which it has waived its sovereign 
     immunity for illnesses and deaths associated with its Nuclear 
     Weapons testing programs during the 1950s and 1960s. This 
     bill is grounded in scientific principles, represents an 
     intent to apologize and offer compassionate compensation to 
     an expanded list of individuals who were not included in the 
     1990 Act but who, nonetheless, deserve restitution.
