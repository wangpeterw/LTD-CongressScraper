                        WELCOMING PRESIDENT MOON

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman Royce and all of my 
colleagues in welcoming President Moon of the Republic of Korea as he 
travels to Washington this week.
  Across 135 years of diplomatic ties, the United States and the 
Republic of Korea have forged a strong and unshakable relationship. Our 
countries have sacrificed together in war--from the Korean war to 
Vietnam, to the Persian Gulf, to Afghanistan--and we have prospered 
together in peace.
  Our alliance, enshrined in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1953, has 
been a pillar of stability and security for both of our countries. That 
alliance is especially important in light of the grave threat just 35 
miles from Seoul: the dangerous regime controlled by dictator Kim Jung-
un in North Korea.
  America grieves with the Warmbier family over the tragic death of 
their young son, Otto. His unjust detention, abuse, and death haunts 
all of us. We must do all we can to secure the safe return of the three 
Americans still detained in North Korea.
  I trust that President Moon's visit will deepen an understanding 
between Washington and Seoul in these trying times so that we may face 
this challenge as we have others: in lockstep, side by side.
