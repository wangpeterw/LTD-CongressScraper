                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I was unavoidably detained for 
rollcall vote No. 138 on adoption of S. Res. 176. Had I been present, I 
would have voted yea.
  As a cosponsor of S. Res. 176, I would have joined many of my 
colleagues in voting for its adoption. Noting this week marks the 50th 
anniversary of the Six-Day War and the reunification of the city of 
Jerusalem, this resolution recognizes that there has been a continuous 
Jewish presence in the city of Jerusalem for 3,000 years and that the 
holy city is home to people of Jewish, Muslim, and Christian faiths. 
This resolution reaffirms longstanding U.S. positions, including that 
the permanent status of Jerusalem must be negotiated between the 
parties through final status negotiations for a two-state solution. 
This resolution further reaffirms the importance of the U.S.-Israel 
relationship and our shared value of promoting religious 
freedom.
