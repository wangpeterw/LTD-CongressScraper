                          IT IS ALL ABOUT GUNS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, there are so many things that the 
American people have to deal with, and I think you have heard many of 
us offer our sympathy and concern for the tragedy that happened in my 
State, and, clearly, one more thing that we don't want to deal with, 
the shooting of those people of faith praying on their day of worship, 
which is what happened in Texas on Sunday.
  So, today, I am introducing H.R. 4268, the Gun Safety Not Sorry Act 
of 2017, that addresses a 7-day waiting period for purchases or sales 
of semiautomatic firearms, silencers, armor-piercing ammunition, or 
large capacity ammunition magazines for purchase or transfer.
  And let me respond to those who offered mental health. The data shows 
that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other 
countries with fewer mass shootings. But it shows that it is estimated 
that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to 
mental health issues.
  Let's not keep giving excuses or blaming people with mental health 
issues. I can assure you that is not the problem. As the article in the 
New York Times says, it is all about guns--guns, guns, guns.
  I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4268.
