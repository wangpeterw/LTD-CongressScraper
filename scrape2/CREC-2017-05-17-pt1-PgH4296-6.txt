             GIVE BACK THE FUTURES OF HARDWORKING AMERICANS

  (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, after coming 
back from Indiana for the last 8 days, I wanted to report what I saw.
  What I saw was too much hopelessness, too much despair, in the eyes 
of too many hardworking Hoosiers, who no longer feel that they have 
control of their financial future, who no longer feel that they can 
participate in the American Dream, and who no longer feel that they can 
start small businesses of their own. But I told them every single day 
when I was back home this past week what we are doing to change that to 
roll back the provisions of Dodd-Frank that have put undue burdens on 
lenders trying to help small businesses across Indiana's Ninth 
District, and across this country, grow and get started; to help 
hardworking Hoosiers be able to start small businesses so they have 
control over their families' future again; to help individuals be able 
to get jobs at growing enterprises because they have access to capital.
  Over the past few years, loan growth has stagnated. In the past 100 
years, coming out of recessions, we have typically seen a loan growth 
of 63 percent, but it has only been 18 percent. It is the difference 
between those two that

has curtailed the futures of many hardworking Americans. I want to make 
sure we give that back to them. That is why I am voting in support of 
the CHOICE Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
