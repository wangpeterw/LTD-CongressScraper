                  CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF MARIA DIAZ

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career 
of Maria Diaz, who will be retiring after more than 35 years serving at 
the Social Security Administration in my hometown of Miami.
  My staff and I have had an opportunity to know and work with her over 
the last 17 years that she has served as a public affairs specialist. 
Throughout that time, she has been an invaluable resource to us and our 
constituents.
  Maria started working at the Social Security Administration in 1982 
in what she thought would be a temporary job, but she quickly grew to 
love her work and those she had an opportunity to serve. Over the last 
three decades, with her calm demeanor and ever-present smile, Maria has 
made a significant impact in the lives of countless individuals in our 
community.
  Mr. Speaker, Maria Diaz is the embodiment of the ideal public 
servant. She has dedicated her life to faithfully and diligently 
serving those most in need in South Florida.
  On behalf of a grateful community, I wish her the best of luck in the 
next exciting chapter of her life.
  Felicidades, amiga.
