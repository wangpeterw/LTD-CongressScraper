                              GOP TAX SCAM

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to provide every 
American with a plot summary of the GOP tax scam.
  Step one: cut taxes for powerful billionaires and millionaires.
  Step two: grow a giant, $2.5 trillion debt.
  Part of that is to also grow the deficit so we can get to step three: 
use that to justify cuts to Medicare and Social Security for our 
seniors.
  Our ability to protect our environment for the future, education, 
infrastructure, research and development, homeland security, and our 
military all will see cuts if this goes through.
  If you are worried about income inequality, this puts that disparity 
on steroids by charging the credit card and getting rid of popular 
deductions to boot, and it will ship jobs overseas by lowering the 
abroad tax rate.
  But don't take my word for it. While Main Street continues to suffer, 
Wall Street is throwing a party with record stock increases today.
  It is time to take a stand against the GOP tax scam.
