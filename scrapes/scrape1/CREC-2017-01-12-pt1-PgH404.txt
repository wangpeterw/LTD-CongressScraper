            STRENGTHEN AFFORDABLE CARE ACT--DON'T REPEAL IT

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand against the plan to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  I believe my job as a Member of Congress is to work every day to 
improve the quality of life for all Americans. If mycolleagues and I 
are going to do our job, access to affordable, quality health care is 
the very foundation of that.
  We know for a fact that the Affordable Care Act is working. Repealing 
it would put millions at risk of losing access tohealth care in a 
country that I know is the greatest. I ask today: Which family should 
not have access to quality health care?
  Repealing the ACA would also have a crippling effect on our economy. 
Jobs will be lost. My State, Florida, is one that willbe hit the 
hardest. Almost 181,000 Floridians would be at risk of losing their 
jobs almost immediately if the ACA were to berepealed.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about the 
people and work to strengthen and not repeal theAffordable Care Act.
