     ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANT ROLE SMALL BUSINESSES PLAY IN OUR 
                              COMMUNITIES

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Small 
Business Week to acknowledge the important role small businesses play 
in our communities nationwide. I am proud to be the product of a small-
business family.
  Small businesses are responsible for creating 63 percent of new jobs, 
and they employ more than 47 percent of the employees in the private 
sector.
  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is also marking the week with events 
hosted by the Small Business Development Center. From workshops to 
webinars, there is information for those looking to start a small 
business and those looking to grow their businesses. Even long-time 
small-business owners can get advice on how to continue to thrive or 
find a renewed sense of direction.
  Pennsylvania Small Business Week recognizes the significant 
contributions of our small businesses and highlights the resources 
available to support their growth in the Keystone State.
  The Nation has celebrated Small Business Week each year since 1963. I 
would like to congratulate all the small-business owners for the role 
they play in employing our neighbors, serving our communities, and 
creating two out of every three new jobs in the United States.
