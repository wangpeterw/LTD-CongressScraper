                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, in thesechallenging days, our hearts are steadfast 
toward You. Lift from our lawmakers all discouragement, cynicism, and 
mistrust. Leadthem safely to the refuge of Your choosing, for You 
desire to give them a future and a hope.
  Lord, give our Senators thepower to do Your will, as they more fully 
realize that they are servants of Heaven and stewards of Your 
mysteries. Provide themwith the wisdom to make faith the litmus test by 
which they evaluate each action, as they refuse to deviate from the 
path ofintegrity.
  Lord, keep them from being careless about their spiritual and moral 
growth, as You give them the courage and thegrace to fulfill Your 
purposes.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
