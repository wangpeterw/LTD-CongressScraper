             REMEMBERING FORMER CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY

  (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a great champion of 
the people who passed away last week at the age of 79. Maurice Hinchey 
was, indeed, a great champion of the people, a great patriot, and a 
great leader.
  I served with him in the State Assembly in New York for 16 years and 
here in the Congress for 20 years. He was perhaps one of the foremost 
environmentalists of his generation. He led the successful fight to get 
General Electric to clean up the PCBs in the Hudson River, to clean up 
that river and make it not quite drinkable yet, but make it 
environmentally safe.
  He led every environmental battle. He is one of those people who made 
it easier to serve in Congress because you could always check and say, 
``Did I do the right thing on an environmental vote,'' by looking to 
see how Maurice voted.
  Maurice was a liberal in a conservative area, and everyone loved him 
because they knew what a wonderful man he was, and they knew how much 
he cared about his constituents and about the country. It didn't matter 
whether he was liberal or conservative. Everybody loved him. We all 
did, we all do, we regret his passing, and may he rest in peace.
