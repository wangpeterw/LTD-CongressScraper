            REMEMBERING JOSEPH ELIJAH ``BUCKSHOT'' COLLETON

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today the Awendaw and McClellanville 
communities will pay tribute to a man known by many as Joseph Elijah 
``Buckshot'' Colleton, who departed this life on June 3, 2016.
  He was a gentle giant who loved children and cooking. Buckshot served 
in many capacities in the community, but he is most remembered for his 
loving spirit towards children. He served the Head Start community for 
more than 35 years as their bus driver and often referred to Head Start 
students as all of his children.
  When he was not with the children, he was cooking and feeding people 
at Buckshot's Restaurant in McClellanville. People from all around 
would visit for a taste of his shrimp and fish dishes and other 
southern cuisines.
  Today we remember the life of Buckshot as loved ones, friends, and 
other guests come together to pay tribute to a great American and South 
Carolinian.
