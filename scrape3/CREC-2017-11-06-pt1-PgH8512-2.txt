                  REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSAL IS ANTI-LIFE

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against the Republican tax 
proposal to raise taxes on the middle class. Moreover, congressional 
Republicans claim to be pro-life, but this tax bill takes a very 
different track.
  Republicans eliminate the tax deduction for medical expenses, which 
will crush millions of seniors and people with chronic illnesses. This 
is antilife, not pro-life.
  Republicans eliminate credits for adoption of children, including 
disabled children. This is antilife, not pro-life.
  Republicans eliminate incentives for employers to provide childcare 
assistance to employees. This is antilife, not pro-life.
  Oh, yes. Republicans also eliminate the student loan interest 
deduction, making payments for college more expensive. They threw that 
in there, too. This is antifamily, antilife, not pro-life for the next 
generation.
  Meanwhile, the six biggest Wall Street banks, as well as big 
pharmaceutical companies, will have their taxes reduced by billions. 
Excess is rewarded again as taxes are raised on the middle class. The 
vast majority of benefits will go to big corporations, pushing more 
jobs offshore.
  Multimillionaires are happily adding up their winnings. Trump, his 
billionaire buddies, and his heirs are laughing all the way to the 
bank.
  The Republican tax plan is immoral, unfair, and antilife. I urge my 
colleagues to scrap it. Life matters.
