                        AMERICA'S ANGELS ABROAD

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers represent what 
is best about America. They are our angels abroad. They give years of 
their lives to help other people. They build goodwill across the globe 
for the United States. But many Peace Corps volunteers don't receive 
the care that they need both in-country and when they get home.
  Peace Corps volunteers struggle to access quality medical treatment 
when they are abroad in remote areas of the world. When they return to 
America, they face a red tape bureaucratic nightmare.
  Congressman Kennedy and I have sponsored the Sam Farr Peace Corps 
Enhancement Act. This act will improve and strengthen the health, 
safety, and well-being of current and returning Peace Corps volunteers. 
It requires that Peace Corps volunteers have access to a qualified 
Peace Corps medical officer overseas. It extends their Peace Corps 
medical coverage when they return home to America.
  America must protect our Peace Corps ambassadors abroad. They are 
some of America's best.
  And that is just the way it is.
