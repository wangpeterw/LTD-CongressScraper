                         BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, not surprisingly, Republicans have had 
to delay the release of their tax plan because it is so deeply 
unpopular. We haven't seen all of the details yet, but what we know 
about it is that this is really bad for working families.
  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that the Republican plan 
raises taxes on many middle class families to pay for a massive tax cut 
for the people at the very top, the wealthiest Americans.
  The details matter. A family of four earning $50,000 could see their 
taxes go up 380 percent. Meanwhile, 80 percent of the benefits of this 
``billionaires first'' tax plan go to the richest 1 percent--80 percent 
of the benefits to the richest 1 percent. That is not middle class tax 
relief.
  And how do we pay for these massive tax cuts to the wealthy? What are 
we going to do?
  We are going to see cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and education.
  If anybody thinks we can do this and go big on infrastructure and 
rebuild America's capacity to produce, they better think twice. Plus, 
saddling our grandkids with a huge debt.
  What happened to the deficit hawks in this place?
  This is wrong, and we ought to reject it.
