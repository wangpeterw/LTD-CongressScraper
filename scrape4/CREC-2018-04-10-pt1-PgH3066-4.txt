many blessings and freedoms we experience.
  We have many challenges in our Nation. We need a moral and spiritual 
renewal to meet those challenges.
  We ask for Your protection over our lives, our families, our 
communities, and schools.
  We pray we would be able to live peacefully, marked by godliness and 
dignity. ``Blessed is the Nation whose God is the Lord.''
  We pray that You would fill the men and women in this Chamber with 
Your wisdom as they consider the business at hand. We pray that the 
decisions that are made would be for the good of our Nation.
  We pray You would give them courage to work together to make 
decisions that make our Nation strong and honorable to You. Father, I 
thank You for the service of these men and women.
  In Jesus' name, amen.
