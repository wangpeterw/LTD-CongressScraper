                       RECOGNIZING PAUL FOGELBERG

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Paul Fogelberg from 
Orono, Minnesota, on receiving the EveryLife Foundation for Rare 
Disease's RareVoice Abbey Award from the EveryLife Foundation.
  No one, Mr. Speaker, deserves this recognition more than Paul because 
of his tireless work on behalf of those suffering from pulmonary 
fibrosis, a disease that stiffens and scars the deep tissue in the 
lungs, making it increasingly difficult to breath until eventually you 
die.
  Every year, more than 14,000 people die from the disease, essentially 
the same number of people who die from breast cancer.
  Paul himself has pulmonary fibrosis and is a strong advocate for 
research, for awareness, and for more clinical trials to help those who 
have contracted this deadly disease. There is no known cure for 
pulmonary fibrosis, yet Paul is a fighter, a leader, and a great 
advocate who is doing all he can to find one.
  Congratulations again to Paul Fogelberg for being recognized as the 
EveryLife Foundation for Rare Disease's RareVoice Abbey Award.
