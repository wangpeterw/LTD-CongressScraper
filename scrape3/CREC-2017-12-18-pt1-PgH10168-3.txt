                         WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Wreaths 
Across America Day, a tribute held annually to honor and remember those 
servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our great 
Nation.
  Since Congress designated Wreaths Across America a national day of 
remembrance in 2007, Americans have joined together at Arlington 
National Cemetery and in their local communities to honor our veterans 
who have passed on.
  This year, more than 1 million wreaths were laid at over 1,300 
cemeteries throughout the country. 245,000 wreaths were placed by 
thousands of volunteers at Arlington National Cemetery.
  On Saturday, in a virtual blizzard, I had the distinct honor of 
joining the Rome-Utica Chapter of the Military Officers Association; 
the Navy ROTC students from Proctor High School in Utica, New York; and 
members of the Marine Corps League at Saint Peter's Church in Rome, New 
York.
  As we laid wreaths on the graves of our fallen servicemen and -women, 
we took a moment to say each veteran's name, to remember each 
individual's life of service, sacrifice, and the families they left 
behind.
  Divided by distance but not by spirit, on Saturday, millions of 
Americans came together in a common mission to honor and remember our 
fallen heroes.
