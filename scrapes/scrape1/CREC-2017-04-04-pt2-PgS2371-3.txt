           MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 861 AND H.R. 1301

  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the 
desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the 
first time en bloc.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 861) to provide for the compensation of Federal 
     employees affected by lapses in appropriations.
       A bill (H.R. 1301) making appropriations for the Department 
     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and 
     for other purposes.

  Mr. GARDNER. I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own 
request, all en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will 
receive their second reading on the next legislative day.
