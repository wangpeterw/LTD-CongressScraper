          HONORING CAPITOL POLICE SPECIAL AGENT ANGEL MORALES

  (Mr. SCALISE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an incredible man, 
Capitol Police Special Agent Angel Morales, who is retiring after 21 
years on the force. Angel has dedicated his entire life to serving our 
country.
  From 1986 to 1991, he put on the uniform of our country serving in 
the U.S. Army, working his way up to sergeant. From there, Angel traded 
his Army uniform for a police uniform and served with the D.C. Metro 
Police.
  Starting in 1996, Angel joined the Capitol Police force, where he has 
protected thousands of visitors, staff, and Members of Congress who 
come through our Nation's Capitol every single day.
  Since 1998, Angel has been assigned to the United States Capitol 
Police Dignitary Protection Division, working with many House leaders, 
including Dick Armey, Roy Blunt, Eric Cantor, and, for the last 3 
years, as the leader of my detail team.
  I would like to thank Angel's wife, Susan, and his two kids, Tatiana 
and Mike, for selflessly allowing Angel to serve our Nation in these 
roles.
  Angel, on behalf of my family and the entire Capitol family, thanks 
for your service. We will miss you, young man.
