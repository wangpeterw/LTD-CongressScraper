                       BORDER WALL AND DREAM ACT

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, finally, I would like to end on a 
positive note. Yesterday, the President's Legislative Director said 
that the topic of the border wall would not be part of the discussion 
between our two parties about the path forward for Dreamers. This is a 
very good thing. The border wall is expensive, unnecessary, completely 
ineffective, not being paid for by Mexico as promised, and it would 
have been a major sticking point in the discussions. I made these 
arguments to the President repeatedly over the last week, and I am glad 
the administration has taken that position. It is a sign of good faith.
  I continue to urge my friend the majority leader and the Speaker of 
the House to put a clean Dream Act on the floor, and I urge President 
Trump to support that as well.
  Thank you.
  I yield the floor.
