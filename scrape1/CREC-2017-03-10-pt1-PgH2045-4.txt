                     MEND THE LAW, NOT END THE LAW

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to the 
repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.
  I will be the first to admit that ObamaCare has its flaws, but we 
should mend the law, not end the law. Because of the ACA, we have seen 
the uninsured rate in Nevada and in my district reduced by half.
  The GOP replacement would not only drop 15 million Americans from 
their insurance and raise healthcare costs on hardworking Nevada 
families, but it would end funding for Planned Parenthood, taking away 
affordable healthcare services that so many women in my district rely 
on.
  Recently I received a letter from a constituent whose family has a 
history of breast cancer. She is so concerned that she and her daughter 
will stop receiving the regular cancer screenings that they need to 
survive.
  Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable for us to vote on a bill that would 
create a life-or-death situation for millions of Americans across the 
country.
