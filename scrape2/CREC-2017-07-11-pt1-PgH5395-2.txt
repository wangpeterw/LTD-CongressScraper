                               TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, despite attempts at resuscitation, TrumpCare 
is close to impasse, charitably speaking. The Senate bill does so much 
harm to all concerned--to Americans who depend on Medicaid or Medicare 
or have a preexisting condition, and actually raises costs out of 
pocket with less coverage while kicking 22 million people, including 
61,000 D.C. residents, off their healthcare plans altogether--that some 
may be tempted to cheer the coming demise of TrumpCare.
  Defeat of TrumpCare may be better than repeal of the Affordable Care 
Act, but to leave it there is to show contempt for the American people.
  Republicans argue that ObamaCare was flawed because it was the 
product of only one party. If so, Republicans should avoid the same 
mistake. The best way for Congress to spend the remaining weeks before 
recess is with Democrats and Republicans at the same table.
