                         IRAN-NORTH KOREA LINK

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, The Post and Courier of 
Charleston, on May 6, explained the Iran-North Korea link in an 
editorial:
  ``President Trump is looking for ways to put a squeeze on North Korea 
that will persuade it to give up nuclear weapons and the missiles to 
carry them . . . there is another collaborator with North Korea that 
appears to be helping it survive: Iran.''
  ``According to Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of 
International Studies in Monterey, California, the evidence of 
collaboration between North Korea and Iran is ample and of long 
standing. `The very first missiles we saw in Iran were simply copies of 
North Korean missiles. Over the years, we have seen photographs of 
North Korean and Iranian officials in each other's countries, and we 
have seen all kinds of common hardware.' ''
  `` . . . President Obama got Tehran to agree to reduce its stock of 
enriched uranium. . . . But the agreement is a weak one if Tehran is 
simply paying Pyongyang to do the design work for missiles and 
warheads. . . .''
  ``And if Iran is paying North Korea for help, then the sanctions . . 
. are also being fatally undermined.''
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
