                       NOMINATION OF RANDY REEVES

  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of 
Randy Reeves of Mississippi to serve as Under Secretary for Memorial 
Affairs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
  Mr. Reeves, a retired, U.S. Navy commander, has distinguished himself 
in Mississippi and around the Nation through his nearly 30-year 
military career and steadfast dedication to veterans. Randy, a 
decorated combat veteran, led the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board 
for the past 8 years. He recently served as president of the National 
Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs and as a member of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs Rural Health Advisory Committee.
  Veterans' cemeteries are hallowed ground on which grateful Americans 
can honor those who have served our Nation in uniform. As Under 
Secretary for Memorial Affairs, Randy will lead the National Cemetery 
Administration, a role for which he is well prepared. Randy 
successfully coordinated design, funding, and construction of 
Mississippi's two State veterans cemeteries.

  I am confident that he will serve the Department of Veterans Affairs 
with distinction. It is with pride and pleasure that I am able to 
recommend to the Senate the nomination of Randy Reeves.
