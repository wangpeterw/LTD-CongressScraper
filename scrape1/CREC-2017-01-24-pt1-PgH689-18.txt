           By Mr. SCHIFF:
       H.R. 695.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Congress has the power to enact the Child Protection 
     Improvements Act of 2017 pursuant to Article I, Section 8, 
     Clause 18, the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Necessary and 
     Proper Clause supports the expansion of congressional 
     authority beyond the explicit authorities that are directly 
     discernible from the text. Additionally, the Preamble to the 
     Constitution provides support of the authority to enact 
     legislation to promote the General Welfare.
