     CONGRATULATING STATE CHAMP PRAIRIE RIDGE WOLVES FOOTBALL TEAM

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Prairie 
Ridge Wolves football team on their second straight Class 6A State 
Championship.
  The team repeated last year's outstanding performance of finishing 
the season without losing a single game. Beating the Nazareth 
Roadrunners in the State final 28-21, the team now has a 28 game 
winning streak. Their last loss was in 2015.
  The team is ranked second in the State overall by the Chicago 
Tribune. Coach Chris Schremp has been a critical and central figure in 
their success. A 21-year veteran at Prairie Ridge High School, he was 
named IHSA Football Coach of the Year and is now competing for the 
national recognition.
  Another crucial part of the team is quarterback Samson Evans. He had 
a fantastic season. Dubbed ``Superman'' for his exploits on the field, 
Evans was named the Chicago Sun-Times 2017 Player of the Year. He will 
continue his career as an Iowa Hawkeye alongside teammate and lineman 
Jeff Jenkins.
  Congratulations, Prairie Ridge Wolves, for your excellent season, and 
here is to a continued undefeated winning streak.
