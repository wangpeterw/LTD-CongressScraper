               RECOGNIZING ACHIEVEMENTS OF LEROY BALDWIN

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and 
achievements of Leroy Baldwin. A true American original, Leroy Baldwin 
was born and raised in Ocala, Florida, on December 15, 1932. Not coming 
from a family with a rich ag background, Mr. Baldwin bought his first 
calf when he was 6 years of age from the money he earned delivering 
newspapers.

  Mr. Baldwin served honorably in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1955 
during the Korean war. After the war, he pursued his lifelong project, 
the Baldwin Angus Ranch. Starting with 40 acres, the ranch now spans 
620 acres and has taken the Florida Angus breed all over the world.
  Mr. Baldwin thanked God each and every day for the blessings his 
family and business enjoyed.
  God, family, and country are the words he lived by, words vitally 
important to our Nation today. We have lost a true giant.
  Mr. Baldwin, may God bless you, your family, and thank you for what 
you have done for Florida and our Nation's agriculture.
