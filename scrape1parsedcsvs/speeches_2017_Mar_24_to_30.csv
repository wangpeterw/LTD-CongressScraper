699,topic-id,1840,"Mr.President, redundancy is often a virtue, so I am about to practice redundancy.  Last week, I made a speech on the floor of the Senate about the upcoming votes in connection with the President's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and I talked about the 230-year history of this body to always have Presidential nominations for judges--for Supreme Court Justices, for Federal district judges, and for circuit judges up to 2003 by a majority vote. Never in the history of this body has the Senate refused to allow a vote, an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court  Because I hear that may be what the Democrats are planning to do--even though Mr.Gorsuch may be one of the most remarkably talented nominees in a long, long time--I want to make the address that I made last week again, and I am going to deliver it word for word in hopes that someone may actually hear it.  President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a member of the U.Supreme Court will be considered on the floor of the Senate next week. Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of Senators to decide whether to approve the Gorsuch nomination, there should first be a so-called cloture vote to determine whether to cut off debate.  Now, you can see what would happen. Cutting off debate requires the approval of 60 There are 46 Democratic Senators, so if 41 of the 46 Democrat Senators vote not to cut off debate, we would never get to a vote on Judge We would never get to a vote. In other words, the 41 Democratic Senators would have filibustered to death the Gorsuch nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, a partisan act that has never happened before in the 230 years of the  Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination or any Presidential nomination, for that matter, flies in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition.  Throughout the Senate's history, approval of even the most controversial Presidential nominations have required only a majority vote. For example, in 1991, President George H.Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to be Associate Justice of the U.Supreme[[Page S2037]]The debate was bitter. The vote was narrow. The Senate confirmed Justice Thomas 52 to 48.  Although Senate rules have allowed any one Senator to try to filibuster the nomination to death, to insist on a 60-vote vote, not one did. In fact, Senate rules have always allowed Senators the option to filibuster to death a Presidential nomination, yet it has almost never happened.  According to the former Senate historian, with one possible exception, which I will describe later, the number of Supreme Court Justices in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero. The number of the President's Cabinet members in our country's history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. The number of Federal district judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. I know that for a fact because an attempt was made to filibuster one--Judge McConnell from Rhode Island--and I voted against that, as did other Republican Senators, because we thought it was wrong to break the Senate's 230-year tradition of always considering judges by majority vote, and we prevailed.  We could have done it, but we didn't do it. That is the point.  Next week, the Democrats can filibuster Judge Gorsuch to death, but they shouldn't do it. They shouldn't do it.  Until 2003, the number of circuit judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster was zero.  Senator Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Lyndon Johnson's nominees. Senator Robert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan's nominees. Senator Howard Baker did not filibuster President Carter's nominees. Senator Bob Dole did not filibuster President Clinton's nominees.  During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White House and the Senate 70 percent of the time, the minority never filibustered to death a single Presidential nomination.  On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on legislation--so many that in 1917, the Senate adopted the so-called cloture rule as a way to end filibusters. The idea is, after you talk enough, you should bring it to an end, so they had a supermajority for that purpose. The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975, 1979, and 1986--always in response to filibusters on legislation, never on nominations. It was the 1975 change that established the current cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate, except on amendments to the Standing  Filibustering a Presidential nomination has always been treated differently than filibustering a legislative matter. The filibuster of legislation is perhaps the Senate's most famous characteristic. It has been called ``democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head off.''  As the actor Jimmy Stewart says in the movie ``Mr.Smith Goes to Washington'': ``Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I've got to say, even if it takes all winter.'' That was Jimmy Stewart talking about his filibuster.  The late Robert Byrd described the importance of a legislative filibuster in this way in his last speech to the Senate: ``Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited debate and protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this since the Senate first convened.''  In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have a majority rule on legislation. Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the legislative filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force there to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect one another's views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important matters. We did that last December in a piece of legislation that the majority leader called the most important legislation of the Congress, the 21st Century Cures There were enormous differences of opinion about it, but because Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat and I, and the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and in the House, and President Obama and Vice President Biden all wanted a result, we formed a consensus. We resolved our differences, and we agreed on this most important piece of legislation that will help virtually every American family by advancing cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and a variety of diseases.  Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation. For example, under Senate rule XIV, any Senator can bring legislation directly to the Calendar of General Orders, bypassing committees. There is no such power for nominations. There is no rule XIV for nominations. Senate rules allow debate and, therefore, the possibility of filibuster on a motion to proceed to legislation. Debate is not allowed on a motion to proceed to nominations. So there can't be a filibuster on a motion to proceed to a nomination. In summary, while Senate rules have always allowed for extended debate or filibusters, the filibuster was never used to block a nomination until recently.  As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet nomination, never used to block a Federal district judge, until 2003, never used to block a Federal circuit judge, and never used to block a Supreme Court Justice, with one possible exception. The exception occurred in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson sought to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief There was bipartisan opposition to that idea. When it became clear that the Senate majority would not agree, President Johnson engineered a 45-43 cloture vote so that Fortas could save face and appear to have won something, according to the former Senate Fortas then asked the President to withdraw the nomination.  Other than that, never has a Supreme Court nominee been filibustered to death in the Other than the Fortas nomination, the filibuster was never used to block any judicial nomination until 2003 and 2004, when Democrats for the first time decided to use the 60-vote cloture requirement to block 10 of President George Bush's nominees. I had just arrived in the I remember it well. I was really outraged by it because, as for the nominees, it was the right of the President to name them and the right of the Senate to reject them. But throughout history it was always by 51 votes. This unprecedented action by the Senate Democrats produced a threat by Republicans to change the Senate rules to make it clear that only a majority is required to approve a Presidential nomination. There was a negotiation, and eventually five of Bush's nominees were approved, five were blocked, and the rules weren't changed.  Then in 2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor. That happens around here--a precedent set by that side then becomes a precedent that this side, then, undertakes. In 2011 and 2013, the Republicans returned the favor by seeking to block five of President Obama's nominees for the circuit court by insisting on a 60-vote cloture on each. Republicans alleged the President was trying to pack the Federal Circuit Court of the District of Columbia with three liberal justices. To overcome Republican objections, the Democrats invoked the so-called nuclear option. They broke the Senate rules to change the rules. The new rule eliminated the possibility of 60-vote cloture motions for all Presidential nominations except for the Supreme Court, which is where we are today.  There have been other examples of minority Senators filibustering nominations to death, all of them during the last three administrations and all involving sub-Cabinet nominations. Then, of course, there have been delays in considering nominations.  My own nomination in 1991 as U.Education Secretary was delayed for 51 days--I thought improperly--by a Democratic President Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the United States was delayed 1 year by a Democratic No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who was in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine and sometimes to cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to defeat nominees by a majority vote.  But, as we approach the vote next week on Neil Gorsuch on the floor of the Senate, it is useful to remember that the tradition of the Senate has been to treat legislative matters one way and Presidential nominations a different way: to filibuster to death[[Page S2038]]legislation, yes; to filibuster to death Presidential nominations, no.  Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the floor soon, as I believe it will, overwhelming Senate tradition requires that whether to approve it should be decided by a majority vote and there should be no attempt by the minority to filibuster the nomination, especially of such a qualified man.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2032-2.txt,1695,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,March
960,topic-id,981,"Mr.President, I notice my distinguished friend was indignant over the Supreme Court debate. I think each of us has a right to have his own opinion. Here is mine.  There is such a thing called the Thurmond-Leahy rule. It has been in place for a while. I think it reads that after June of a Presidential election year, the Senate will not confirm a[[Page S2090]]President's nominees. That is a bipartisan rule that has been enforced by the Senate for several years. Senator McConnell moved it up three months, from June to March--that is true--even though Democratic leaders said that is exactly what they would have done if the shoe had been on the other foot.  Democrats are saying that as a result of that--the 3-month change--which is what they said they would have done anyway, they are going to do something that has never been done before: They are going to deny a Supreme Court Justice a nomination by not allowing a majority vote. That has never happened in 230 years. Our nominations have always been decided by a majority vote. There was a little incident in 1968 with Abe Fortas when President Johnson sought to elevate him to Chief Justice, but that has been the tradition in the We have always approved Presidential nominees by a majority vote, and we have always approved Cabinet members by a majority vote, even controversial ones. We have never required them to get 60 votes--ever--and the same with Federal district judges. And the same was true with Federal circuit judges until the Democrats started using the filibuster to require 60 votes, as has been well documented here. So I think people need to know the facts.  What the Democrats are proposing to do next week--quite apart from the fact that Judge Gorsuch is one of the most eminently qualified people we have seen come around in a long time--flies in the face of 230 years of tradition in the Senate by insisting that a Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court requires more than 51 votes to be confirmed.  I looked very quickly back at my own votes. None of us are perfect, and I am not asking for any merit badges, but I wonder where the Democrats are who are trying to do at least what I was trying to do when President Obama was there. I found at least 10 times that I voted for cloture--voted to cut off debate--on controversial nominees with whom I disagreed, and then I voted against them when the vote was 51.  With Secretary of Labor Perez, cloture was invoked 60 to 40. If I had voted no, that would have denied him his Cabinet position. He is now the chairman of the Democratic National I cannot think of any Cabinet member I disagreed more with, other than perhaps the one I am about to mention next, but I thought the President deserved to have his own nominee, and I thought we ought to respect the tradition of never having denied a Cabinet member a position because of a 60-vote requirement.  Another one was John King, the Education I asked President Obama to appoint him or somebody of his choosing. I thought we needed an Education Secretary for a year even though I have great differences with John I respect him greatly, but I have differences with him.  So I got him confirmed as chairman--I don't want to say it that way. I asked the President to do it, as chairman of the committee. I saw that he had a prompt confirmation, and then I made sure he had enough votes to be confirmed--not by much. When it came to cloture, I may have even voted for him when it came to it, just because I thought the President deserved to have his own appointment.  Then there was Attorney General Cloture was invoked with only 66 votes. I voted to end debate and have a vote on her.  Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel--there was opposition to him. I voted no there on confirmation, but I voted to make sure that there was a vote. I voted for cloture.  For two National Labor Relations Board members and a National Labor Relations Board General Counsel, cloture was invoked by 64, 65, and 62 votes--very close. I voted against all three of them for confirmation, just as I did Secretary Perez, because I disagreed with them so much. But I thought that we ought to respect the fact that we confirm Presidential appointees by 51 votes.  There are three or four others, but I want to mention only one more specifically: District Court Judge John McConnell, Jr., from Rhode There was an effort on this side of the aisle to deny him a cloture vote. I resisted that. I talked to some other I voted for him for cloture. He got it 63 to 33. Then I voted against him for judge.  The importance of that was if he had had his nomination blocked by the cloture vote, he would have been the first Federal istrict judge in the history of the court to not have been allowed to have an up-or-down vote, majority vote. So I resisted that in that instance. I resisted that for I may have been the deciding vote; there were only 60 votes.  While I said I am not looking for merit badges, where are the Democrats who are willing to vote like that--to preserve the Senate's 230-year tradition of approving Presidential nominees by a majority vote? I think this is a terrible precedent, not justified, and I am sorry to see things heading in this direction.  Now I wish to make some remarks on another matter.  (The remarks of Mr.Alexander pertaining to the introduction of 761 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')

985,topic-id,1130,"Mr.President, the Health Care Options Act of 2017, introduced by Senator Corker and me, would address the emergency in the health insurance exchanges in Tennessee and in other This legislation would allow any American who receives a subsidy and has no insurance available on their exchange next year to use that subsidy to buy any State-approved insurance off the exchange.  Second, the legislation would waive the Affordable Care Act requirement that these Americans--who, remember, have zero insurance options for their subsidies--have to pay a penalty for not purchasing the insurance.  Third, the legislation would bring peace of mind between now and the beginning of 2018 to millions of Americans--some of the most vulnerable people in our country--who face having zero options of health insurance to purchase with their subsidy in the year 2018 because of the collapsing ObamaCare exchange markets.  Here is why urgent action is needed. There are 11 million Americans who buy individual insurance now on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Approximately 85 percent of them receive a subsidy to help them buy insurance. For those who don't like subsidies for people buying insurance, I would remind us that about 60 percent of insured Americans get insurance on the job, and the average tax break for people with employer sponsored insurance is about $5,000. What we are talking about is the 4 percent of insured people who don't get insurance on the job, who don't get it from the government and Medicare and Medicaid, and this subsidy gives them some money to help them buy insurance if they are mostly low income.  While these 11 million make up only 4 percent of the total insured population in this country, this 4 percent is where much of today's political turmoil rests.  In the Knoxville area where I live, the one remaining insurance company on the Affordable Care Act exchange has pulled out for the year 2018. So it is a near certainty that there will be zero insurance options for 40,000 Tennesseans who live there and buy their insurance on the exchange. In other words, for approximately 34,000 Tennesseans living in Knoxville who rely on an Affordable Care Act subsidy to buy health insurance, their subsidies will be worth as much as a bus ticket in a town with no buses running.  There is a real prospect that the same thing may happen to all 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the exchange. As I said, 85 percent of them rely on a subsidy to afford insurance; they just will not have any insurance policies to buy.  The decision Friday by the House of Representatives to not vote on the health care bill changes nothing about the urgency of rescuing these 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges that our State insurance commissioner has told us are ``very near collapse.''  While Congress continues its work to enact long-term structural health reforms, we must take immediate action to help these 230,000 Tennesseans and millions of Americans in other States facing the same dire consequences.  This is not just a problem for Last year, 7 percent of counties in the country had just one insurer offering plans on their Affordable Care Act exchange. This year, that 7 percent has risen to 32 percent of the counties in this country having just one insurer offering plans on the Affordable Care Act exchange. There are five States this year that have only a single insurer offering ACA plans in their entire State--Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and And in nine States, there is only one insurer offering ACA plans in a majority of the[[Page S2101]]counties in the States: Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, and  Next year, in 2018, we know the problem will be much worse. As more insurance companies announce their plans for the 2018 plan year, it is very likely that more counties across the Nation will face challenges similar to those in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area, where, again, having an ObamaCare subsidy will be as useful as having a bus ticket in a town with no buses running.  Now, there is a solution to this. As I mentioned, the legislation that Senator Corker and I are introducing will do three things: First, it will allow Americans to use their Affordable Care Act subsidy--the money they are getting now--to purchase any health insurance plan outside of the exchange, as long as the insurance is approved by the State for sale in the individual market. That means Americans on the exchanges will have options to purchase insurance where the Affordable Care Act has left them with none. This option will be given to individuals who live in the counties where the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that there are zero options on the ACA exchange.  Second, when the Secretary certifies that there are zero insurance options on the exchange, the legislation will waive the Affordable Care Act's requirement to buy a specific health plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four. The law's individual mandate, in other words, will not apply to these individuals. And, of course, it shouldn't. They shouldn't be penalized for not buying insurance when there is no insurance to buy.  The legislation's temporary authority would be in place only through the end of the 2019 plan year.  Third, I hope that this legislation will provide some peace of mind for those Knoxville area residents and Americans in counties across the country trapped in collapsing exchanges.  This is not a permanent solution. Congress has a responsibility to continue its work to solve this problem and to give more Americans more choices of lower cost health insurance.  Long term, Americans should have the freedom to make their own choices about their family's health care needs. But in the short term, we must act on behalf of 230,000 Tennesseans, some of the most vulnerable citizens in our State, and millions of other Americans in other States who are likely to have zero choices of insurance in 2018.  Earlier this afternoon, the Tennessee insurance commissioner, Julie Mix McPeak, who has testified before the Senate and made public statements that the Tennessee Affordable Care Act exchanges were in virtual collapse--what she means by that is no one will be selling insurance in them--issued this statement in support of the bill that Senator Corker and I have introduced. She said:       This bill ``would definitely be helpful for Tennessee      consumers. We are in favor of any legislation that improves      consumer choice and provides access for It is      completely unacceptable for our consumers to have a subsidy      but no ability to purchase insurance on the exchange. We      support any option that avoids that result.''

In fact, years ago, I spent some time as a worker in one of these very factories.

Time and again, the EPA has issued extensive regulations without ever showing the science to back up their claims to justify these regulations. It is like they have a little black box over there. They don't let anyone else look into it, and they just say: Trust us, we have got good science backing up our claims.  I say, if your science is so good, then don't hide it in your little black box.

1072,topic-id,719,"Mr.Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from Iowa, my good friend for yielding to me.  I rise to express my strong support for the announced policy by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that will terminate U.Department of Justice grants to sanctuary cities. These are the localities that have chosen not to cooperate with the Federal Government when its seeks to deport already-detained criminal aliens.  Under this Trump policy, your hard-earned tax dollars will no longer go to cities and counties that thumb their nose at the Federal immigration authorities and refuse to cooperate.  In President Trump's first 2 months in office, this administration has acted to secure our borders, to encourage compliance with Federal immigration law, and to deport criminal aliens. The previous administration put out the welcome mat for criminal aliens. Thanks to Trump, the welcome mat has now been removed.  A few short days ago, the national news broke on how two illegal aliens from Central America raped a 14-year-old girl in the boys bathroom of a public high school in Rockville, These two young men, Henry Sanchez-Milian, an 18-year-old from Guatemala, and Jose Montano, a 17-year-old from El Salvador, came across our southern border last year as unaccompanied minors. The Obama administration initially targeted them for deportation proceedings, but they were later released to join relatives in  When asked about the situation, Rockville school officials said that the legal status of these two individuals did not matter, as Rockville has declared itself to be a sanctuary city. I beg to differ. It does matter. If the Federal Government had done its duty and immediately returned these illegal immigrants to their home country, this young girl would not have been brutally raped.  For the sake of this young girl, we must secure our borders. This vicious crime would never have taken place had the Obama administration followed the law and secured our borders. The good news is that the new administration is working hard to secure our borders, to deport criminal aliens, and to protect the lives of American citizens.  Cracking down on sanctuary cities is an important first step. In the first month of the Trump administration, ICE issued 3,083 detainers. These are orders for local authorities to keep criminal aliens in custody for 48 hours to enable U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agents to come and get these criminal aliens for deportation. 206 of these detainees were just declined, meaning that local authorities deliberately ignored ICE's detainer requests and released these individuals back out onto American streets.[[Page H2580]]  This is especially concerning because 44 percent of those individuals had already been convicted of crimes in the United These weren't just petty crimes, folks. These include: homicide, rape, assault, domestic violence, indecent exposure with a minor, sex offense against a minor, aggravated assault with a weapon, resisting an officer, vehicle theft, kidnapping, driving under the influence, hit-and-run, and sexual assault.  Thank you, Mr.President, for holding accountable these sanctuary cities that released these criminals back out onto our streets.  We are also working to force foreign countries to take back their criminal alien citizens; 25-year-old Casey Chadwick was murdered by an illegal alien from Haiti, Jean Jacques had been released 6 months earlier and ordered deported after serving a 19-year sentence for attempted murder.  Haiti had refused multiple times to take back Jacques, and under the Obama administration policy, Jacques was simply released onto U.streets to return to his life of crime, although Haiti had gladly taken billions of U.aid. That is why I have introduced H.82, the Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement My bill withholds foreign aid from countries that do not repatriate their criminal aliens.  This commonsense step ensures that countries that benefit from the goodwill of the United States must hold up their end of the bargain and take back their criminal aliens. And through his recent executive order, President Trump declared that he would restrict the issuance of visas to certain residents of noncooperative countries. Congress should support the President by locking in this enforcement with legislation so that a future President does not reverse this enforcement.                              {time}  1115  On behalf of the American people, I applaud President Trump and I call on my colleagues to cosponsor my legislation to lock in these protections for future generations of Americans and keep them safe.

323,topic-id,535,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the past and future of the United States Navy, the strongest and the best Navy in the world.  On this day, March 27, President George Washington signed an ``Act to Provide a Naval Armament'' authorizing the construction of six frigates, which includes the USS Constitution, the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat.  The passage of the Naval Act of 1794 was, in part, a response to threats to American merchant ships from the Barbary pirates in the 223 years later, the men and women of the U.Navy continue to protecting the goods and information we transport via ships and undersea cables to our overseas trading partners.  This includes securing the resources and services we import to fuel our industries. Paraphrasing Admiral Jonathan Greenert: the mandate of the Navy in modern times is to be in the right place, at the right time, ready and able to respond.  The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review signed by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel--may I add a Nebraskan--states that in order to support this mission, we need to ``continue to build a future Fleet that is able to deliver the required presence and capabilities and address the most important warfighting scenarios.''  In that light, I look forward to the commissioning of the USS Omaha this fall, and to congratulating the crew of the newest addition to the United States naval fleet.  The USS Omaha, LCS-12, is an Independence-class littoral combat ship, and the fourth ship to bear the name USS It is a chain dating back to the commissioning of a sloop-of-war in 1869. The last USS Omaha was a nuclear attack submarine that served in the Navy from 1978 to 1995.  According to the Omaha World-Herald, a great source of intelligence, the ship is the sixth in line of Independence-class littoral combat ships with a futuristic trimaran design that sits high above the water.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work once compared it to a Klingon Bird-of-Prey ship in the movie ``Star Trek.'' The ship was christened on December 19, 2015, by Susie  The ship's Latin motto is derived from its namesake, the city of Omaha, It translates to ``Courageously in Every Enterprise,'' which denotes her crew's willingness to brave any future endeavor.                              {time}  1930  While I am very proud of the future crew of the USS Omaha, I am equally proud of the members of the Nebraska Navy League and their counterparts for supporting the Navy's missions, their personnel, and their families. In an effort to strengthen the connection between the USS Omaha and the citizens it serves, the Nebraska Navy League has committed to bringing several members of the crew to our community each year. This endeavor helps to enhance the morale of the Active Duty personnel and their families, but it also helps to inform the American public of the importance of a strong United States  The people in the Second Congressional District are proud to have a fantastic new ship bearing the name of It honors our community and the many men and women from Omaha and the surrounding metro area who proudly serve in the United States Armed  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgH2456-4.txt,2337,1215,2017.0,27.0,March
1198,topic-id,500,"Mr.President, instead of focusing on bipartisan reforms to improve access to healthcare for the American people, Republicans are again pursuing divisive policies that jeopardize women's health and put politics, politicians, and the government between a woman and her doctor. This measure that we are debating this afternoon attacks a critical healthcare program known as the Title X Family Planning  The Title X Family Planning Program provides basic healthcare, like cancer screenings, contraception, and HIV testing to more than 4 million women and men. This politically motivated provision that we have before us today would allow States to discriminate against trusted health providers like Planned In eight counties in Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood is the only health clinic that provides the full range of publicly funded contraceptive services.  I met with Laurie from Bristol, WI, who told me that as a young teacher, she went to Planned Parenthood and they discovered that she had cysts and tumors in her ovaries. The providers immediately helped her get the care she needed. She had quick surgery and was able to recover, which allowed her to eventually have a family.  Republicans are playing doctor and telling women they can't access basic primary and preventive healthcare services at the health center of their choice. This would cut off access to care for millions of men and women, prohibiting access to high-quality, preventive services just because of the sign on the door. They would prevent women like Laurie from accessing lifesaving services when they need it the most.  We have already seen too many States enact record numbers of laws and regulations that restrict a woman's access to reproductive health services and the freedom to make her own healthcare decisions. In my home State of Wisconsin, our Republican Governor has signed a number of laws that target healthcare providers and simply have left far too many Wisconsin women out in the cold. He signed a law that forces women to undergo unnecessary and invasive medical procedures, and he has imposed unreasonable requirements on the doctors that deliver care to women. He has worked to close health clinics, including several Planned Parenthood clinics. But he hasn't stopped there. He also signed two laws that would effectively defund Wisconsin Planned Parenthood, which could leave thousands of Wisconsinites without access to critical health services.  The threat in Wisconsin and in States across the country--and right here in Congress--is clear: Politicians across the country are playing doctor, and this is a dangerous game for women and their families. The millions of Americans who rely on title X for primary care and their trusted providers are being held hostage. They are being used as a political punching bag by congressional Their agenda is to attack women's health.  Women's access to comprehensive healthcare--the healthcare they need and deserve--should never depend upon their ZIP So I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous measure and to protect title X programs for all of our families.

284,topic-id,442,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have seen firsthand in my district how disasters devastate communities and their citizens. In the aftermath of these disasters, while facing the devastation and the daunting task of recovery, many communities encounter even more challenges caused by FEMA, which has been sent there to help.  I continue to hear from my colleagues in Congress about conflicting guidance received from FEMA officials, who constantly change on the ground. I have heard stories of lost documents, lengthy delays, and huge administrative burdens placed on communities doing their best to recover from disasters. And in the worst cases, the guidance provided by FEMA results in the community losing disaster assistance.  Unfortunately, in Missouri, they have faced many of these challenges following floods in August 2013. Congresswoman Hartzler has taken the lead to push FEMA to fix these issues by introducing this bill. I am proud that we are moving H.1117.  One of my focuses as chair of the subcommittee is how we can make disaster assistance programs more effective and efficient and ensure the wise investment of taxpayer dollars. H.1117 will certainly help us do that.

293,topic-id,690,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the purpose of H.1214, the Disaster SAVE Act, is to speed up small disaster reconstruction projects and lower their costs by removing red tape.  One of my biggest priorities since becoming chairman of the subcommittee has been reducing disaster costs and losses and reducing disaster risks. I was mayor for 11 years, and I saw so many friends' and neighbors' businesses and communities impacted by disasters.  One of the things I hear most often from my colleagues in Congress is frustration about inconsistent guidance from FEMA and funding take backs, even when there is no evidence of misuse. If you have ever had a big disaster in your district, you know exactly what I am talking about.  In my district, FEMA reversed its prior approval and has been fighting for years with the local government over whether or not they should have paved a temporary access road that was built after a major flood. The cost of the gravel road was $230,000. The extra cost to pave it, which the community covered with its own funds, was about $50,000.  The amount of money FEMA has wasted in salaries, administration, and legal fees trying to take back the $230,000 likely exceeds the entire project cost. This is red tape out of control, and it doesn't serve the taxpayers well. We know there is a better way to manage these projects.  Under current law, FEMA runs projects under $130,000 in a manner similar to an insurance settlement. FEMA reviews the damage, makes a cost estimate, and issues a repair grant. The local government is responsible for managing the grant on time and on budget.  In exchange, they have greater flexibility in how they bill back, and they can enhance a project with their own funds. This approach dramatically cuts administrative costs, rebuilds infrastructure faster, eliminates the cost overruns for Federal taxpayers, and gives local governments the flexibility to rebuild in a way that best meets their needs.  The success of FEMA's small project program is well proven thanks to the prior efforts of the Transportation The former chairman of the subcommittee, from California, worked diligently to give FEMA the flexibility to administratively increase the small project threshold, which finally passed as part of the Hurricane Sandy supplemental package.  H.2114, the Disaster SAVE Act, will raise the current project cap for this program from $130,000 to $500,000 and help all of our constituents avoid the project nightmare my district is experiencing right now. This will speed up rebuilding efforts and reduce disaster recovery costs.                              {time}  1715  The vast majority of FEMA's rebuilding projects are less than $500,000, but FEMA continues to micromanage the administration of these projects at a tremendous cost in time and money. FEMA testified in 2015 that increasing this threshold would result in lower administrative costs, faster project completions, and fewer deobligations.  After 4 years, the program will sunset and Congress will decide, based on outcomes, lessons learned, and stakeholder input, if the program should continue or not. The House adopted[[Page H2450]]similar language last year when it passed the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  FEMA provides public assistance funds after a disaster or emergency to State, tribal, and local governments and some private nonprofits. These funds reimburse communities and other entities for activities such as debris removal costs, emergency protective measures, and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.  Currently, for projects under--however they chose that number--$122,100--I am surprised they didn't add on 10 cents--reimburses grantees based on cost estimates rather than actual costs. This bill would require FEMA to increase this threshold to $500,000. This would be temporary authority, expiring on September 30, 2021. We would require that this be closely tracked. There is a strong indication that this will actually expedite reimbursement, ultimately save funds, and will not subject these projects to abuse.

298,topic-id,1105,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We know earthquakes pose one of the greatest natural hazards here in the United They strike without warning and result in potentially catastrophic casualties and damage to buildings and infrastructure.  The Pacific Northwest is at risk of severe earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. According to the experts, a massive earthquake is coming to the area. We just don't know when. Six years ago this month, a 9.0 earthquake in Japan created a tsunami that killed over 15,000 people and caused a nuclear disaster.  Earthquakes cannot be prevented, but their impacts on life, property, and the economy can be managed. FEMA is responsible for coordinating the Federal response to a catastrophic earthquake, and has been diligently working to help States plan and prepare for an earthquake. Good planning and preparedness can save lives and property.  H.654, the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2017, directs FEMA to plan the development of an earthquake early warning system for the Cascadia Subduction The bill also directs the President to establish an earthquake and tsunami task force to develop a comprehensive strategy and recommendations on how to prepare and plan for seismic events.  I want to commend the ranking member for his leadership on this critical national issue. He has been an advocate for his State and the Pacific Northwest, supporting preparedness and mitigation efforts and the development of a public West Coast earthquake early warning system.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,            and Technology,                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 2017.     Bill Shuster,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: I am writing concerning H.654, the      ``Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2017,''      which was reported by your Committee on March 9, 2017.       H.654 contains provisions within the Committee on      Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. In      order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego      action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our      mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or      alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,      and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,      or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.       I would request that, in any final version of the      legislation, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology      be included as a recipient of the reports called for in      Sections 2 and 3 of the bill.       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding, and would request that you include a copy      of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record      during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in      advance for your cooperation.

Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.654, the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act      of 2017. I appreciate your willingness to expedite      consideration of this legislation before the House of      Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek to      litigate its claim of jurisdictional interest in this bill.       The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure concurs      with the mutual understanding that by foregoing the      litigation of its claim of jurisdictional interest in the      bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology does not waive any claim to jurisdiction over the      subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation      in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill      become necessary, I would work with the Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology to litigate its jurisdictional claim      and, if such a claim is established by the Parliamentarians,      support your request to be represented on the conference      committee.       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional      Record during consideration on the House floor. I look      forward to working with the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology as the bill moves through the legislative process.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Shuster,                                                          Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the chairman for his kind words for the work I have been doing for a number of years on this issue.  I traveled with the committee last year to Japan to see what lessons they learned from the horrible earthquake 6 years ago, in which more than 15,000 people perished. They did have in place a land-based and near-ocean early warning system, which gave them enough time to shut down the high-speed trains, get people out of elevators in buildings, shut down production lines, mitigating economic losses[[Page H2452]]and property damage. But, unfortunately, the system was not adequate to predict the height of the tsunami, and 15,000 people died.  They are now deploying a realtime deep ocean system. It is time for the United States to emulate that. The Cascadia Subduction Zone, off the coast of northern California and Oregon, has had at least a dozen massive earthquakes over the last 5,000 years. It is currently well overdue for an earthquake. If we had in place a deep ocean system near the southern end of that fault where they expect the major quake will start, it would give enough warning time for people on the coast of Oregon, and at least those a little further up the coast, to seek higher ground and not be inundated. It would provide more time in the valleys, and up in Portland and up in Seattle for transit systems to be shut down and people to take shelter. So this could save many lives.  This bill directs FEMA to develop a plan to identify the necessary funds and the potential costs to purchase the equipment for an earthquake early warning system. It is basically off-the-shelf technology.  It requires the President to establish an earthquake and tsunami task force. The task force will consist of representatives from potentially impacted areas, as well as earthquake and tsunami experts to develop comprehensive strategy recommendations on how the Nation should prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, recover from, and adapt to an earthquake, tsunami, or combined event in the Cascadia Subduction  I strongly recommend this bill to my colleagues. We should learn from the disaster in Japan and take action here to save lives and property in the event of this quake in the Cascadia Subduction  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

948,topic-id,867,"Mr.President, I would like to add my voice to that of the Senator from I thank him for his leadership and for his excellent work on the matters that he has been addressing.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I am here to address the issue, as I have done before and will again, of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice of the U.Supreme America needs judges who can follow the law, who have the highest ethical standards, and who value the independence of our courts. That is the description of Neil That is him in a nutshell. We saw it throughout his career, and we saw it again in his confirmation hearing last week.  Democrats on the committee asked him to talk about issues that are going to be coming up before the Supreme Well, Judge Gorsuch--we know what he did. He followed the rules, the ethics rules. These are the rules that say that judges and nominees should not answer those kinds of questions.  Following the rules is exactly what he should have done, and it is exactly what other nominees that both Republican and Democratic Presidents have placed on the Court have done in the past.  It is what Ruth Bader Ginsburg did at her confirmation hearing in 1993. She said that a ``judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints.'' She said that this would ``display disdain for the entire judicial process.'' She was confirmed.  That is exactly what Judge Gorsuch said. That is the Ginsburg standard, and every nominee since then has followed that standard.  Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also tried last week to criticize Judge Gorsuch for some of his opinions that they didn't like. They suggested that the Court should have ignored the law--ignored the law and sided with ``the little guy'' in these cases.  Judge Gorsuch was quick to point out that all judges are absolutely not supposed to consider who they think is sympathetic. They are to rule based on the law.  Federal judges actually swear an oath to ``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''  It is interesting because the minority leader, Senator Schumer, himself has spoken about how important it is for a judge to be impartial. In 2009, at the confirmation hearing for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, he praised the way that she put the ``rule of law above everything else.'' He said that she did this even when it led to rulings that ``go against so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was 2009.  Fast forward to 2017. It is the identical standard that Judge Gorsuch has followed. He pointed out that it is his job to apply the law, and writing the laws is the job of the legislative branch of government.  We are not here selecting the 101st This is not about who ought to be another This is about who should be on the Supreme We are selecting a Justice for the most important Court of the land.[[Page S2082]]  Nearly everyone who has looked at this nominee's record, who has watched his confirmation hearing agrees that he would be an excellent There was one lawyer who wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post on March 8. He is a board member of the liberal American Constitution He wrote that ``there is no principled reason'' to vote against Judge A Denver Post editorial last week said Judge Gorsuch would make ``a marvelous addition to the Supreme Court.'' The American Bar Association has given him its highest possible rating. He was even introduced at his confirmation hearing last week by a former top lawyer for the Obama administration. Neal Katyal is a He was the Acting Solicitor General of the United States for President He has called Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.''  I think any Democrat who watched the confirmation hearings and looked at the nominee's record will decide it is an easy decision to confirm him.  If there is a Democrat who reaches the opposite conclusion, I say: Come to this floor. Come to the floor of the U.Explain why you think our judges should go into a case favoring one side or another. If you think a judge should make promises about how he will rule just to win the vote of a Senator, go ahead. Come to the floor. Make your case. If you think that a Justice of the Supreme Court should ignore the law and rule not based on the law but by that judge's own preferences, please come to the floor and say so. I don't think that is what the American people want.  The American people want judges who are smart, who are principled, who are fair, and who know that their job is to follow the law, not write the law. The American people know that Neil Gorsuch is exactly that kind of judge, and that is the kind of judge who we should have on the Supreme Court and on every court of the land.

987,topic-id,1413,"Mr.President, even with all the dysfunction in Congress, somehow the American people continue to expect that Washington will enact policies that bear at least some relationship to the challenges they face. Unfortunately, the administration's new Executive order on energy fails even that low bar.  This order will not expand energy production, it will not make us more energy independent, it will not create more American jobs, and it will also not protect us from the ravages of climate change. That last point is somewhat less surprising than the first because, unlike millions of Americans and 99 percent of scientists, this administration does not believe that climate change is real or that humankind is contributing to it.[[Page S2102]]  To understand where this Executive order comes from, I think it is important to see where we were before this administration took office. Put simply, the United States was already on track to achieve energy independence. Our country is producing a tremendous amount of low-cost energy. Since 2008, solar energy production has grown more than 50-fold, wind power is up 3-fold, and oil production in the United States of America is up 75 percent. In fact, 5 years ago, we began producing more oil than we import.  You can see on this slide that over the period of time that the Obama administration was in office, oil production rose like this, and net imports have gone like this--an important fact considering our geopolitical situation in the world. We are also now producing so much natural gas that facilities that were built originally to import gas are now being reengineered to export gas from the United I, along with other people in this Chamber, have worked hard to try to make sure those facilities are expedited so we can get the benefit of that exported natural gas.  Even before President Trump rode to the rescue with his Executive order, the Wall Street Journal told us that exports of natural gas could more than double over the next 5 years, just based on what we are doing already. We are also using energy far more efficiently in our homes, our appliances, and our automobiles, which is why the administration's action to reverse higher fuel standards last week--well, I just would say, talk about a solution in search of a problem. That is one.  There is not a person in Colorado who said to me: Michael, do you know what we ought to do? We ought to reduce the fuel efficiency standards on automobiles. We ought to create a regulatory environment where the United States can't sell competitive automobiles in the world. Nobody has said that because not only are they concerned about climate, they are concerned that we lead the world when it comes to innovation. And that order, just like a budget that cuts the EPA by 30 percent, that targets the climate scientists at the EPA, that targets the satellites that are above our heads so that we can't see what is happening on our planet--this is all so we can perpetuate a willful view that climate change doesn't exist, and it is the same thing with this Executive order.  All of the trends that are in place right now--right before this administration took office--have combined to reduce our reliance on foreign energy in recent years, even as our economy has grown and average prices at the pump, because of the abundant supply, remain under $2.30. We are just a few years away from exporting as much oil and gas as we import. That is important for our country.  Colorado has been a huge part of America's growing energy independence and, by extension, our national security. That is because in many ways Colorado led the way in developing a commonsense approach to expanding energy production while ensuring clean air and a healthy planet. We brought environmentalists together with the oil and gas industry to develop one of the first State limits on methane pollution. It became a model for the country. We passed the first voter-led renewable energy standard in the Nation, which became a model for the country. We established our own limits on carbon pollution at the State level, and in this process we have created 13,000 renewable energy jobs, with wind jobs alone expected to triple by 2020. On average, these jobs pay over $50,000. This is not some Bolshevik experiment or some socialist experiment. These are manufacturing jobs in the United States of America, in Colorado, that would not be there if it hadn't been for the policy decisions that were made in this body and in other parts of Washington, DC, and the supply chain that goes along with those manufactured turbines is critically important to our economy. At the same time we were doing all that, we preserved over 56,000 oil and gas jobs, even as drilling has slowed because of, again, abundant supply, to say nothing of the jobs Colorado has created just because it is a place where other people would like to live. They want to come to Colorado, as they want to go to Nevada, because there is a high quality of life. There is a lot of sunshine in both places.  I am pleased to have the chance to work with the Senator from Nevada to make sure we not only extended the investment tax credit with respect to solar, but we put language in there together--Republicans and Democrats together--to create an idea that those credits would kick in at the beginning of construction, not having to wait until the end. That has made a big difference to our solar industry.  Long ago, the State of Colorado and, I would say, many other States have broken past the false choice between our economy and the environment. That is the course we have charted in Colorado, and if the President were serious about energy independence, he would support that approach. Instead, he is trying to undermine it with this new order. By undoing national standards for carbon pollution, the order threatens to undercut our thriving clean energy industry. There are 465 solar and wind businesses across our State supporting over $8 billion in investments. By retreating from the fight against climate change, the order recklessly endangers Colorado's $646 billion outdoor recreation industry, not to mention the health of our national forests that line the banks of some of the most vital watersheds in  As the President targets our environment and clean energy economy with this Executive order, he has dressed it up as something good for jobs, as he did during the campaign. Yesterday, the President stood before a group of coal miners and promised to ``cancel job-killing regulations'' and ``put our miners back to work.''  Just 2 weeks ago, I was on the Western Slope of Colorado, a region with a number of mining communities. These communities, some of whom have helped invent hydraulic fracture and directional drilling, know that their challenges have far more to do with low prices and competition from natural gas than from the They know that their way of life and the way of life of communities like theirs all across the United States require real solutions to help them grow and diversify their economies. These communities get it. They understand it, but the President clearly does not.  Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal ran this article entitled ``Despite Trump Move on Climate Change, Utilities' Shift from Coal Is Set to Continue.'' According to the article, last year, power from coal plants fell while power from natural gas rose 35 percent. Nationwide major utilities are shedding coal and increasing natural gas and renewables. That is the reality of our energy market and of the global economy, but this administration, when it comes to energy and when it comes to climate, is not operating in reality. It is operating amongst political slogans. It is operating in the theater of the absurd, where policies have no relationship to problems, facts don't matter, and false promises to struggling Americans are just another political tactic to win a cable news cycle.  The American people deserve so much better. Colorado deserves so much better than that. That is why today I am introducing a bill alongside more than 30 Senators to rescind this disastrous order, protect American jobs, and preserve our path toward energy independence. The stakes could not be higher for our kids, our planet, and our economy. We cannot let this stand.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgS2100.txt,1965,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,29.0,March
1200,topic-id,686,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be here with the Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ranking member of the HELP Committee to address this important issue.  You would think that after the healthcare debacle last week, the other side would have gotten the message, which is that the American people didn't send us to Washington to take away their healthcare.  When I think about healthcare in Colorado, I think about sort of a circle that contains healthcare that people in my State are either getting or not getting, and some part of that is ObamaCare, that is for sure, but a lot of it has nothing to do with that. They are unhappy with the way our healthcare system works. They want more access than they have. The House bill went at this in exactly the wrong direction from where they are interested in going.  I would like to work with Republicans and Democrats to solve that, but this afternoon we are here once again because the resolution before us would risk funding for vital primary care, preventive and family planning services for more than 4 million Americans across our country, especially women and those who live in rural communities of my State and other  Since 1970, this body has supported title X funding to expand access to affordable healthcare for low-income men and women. We did that because we understood that it wasn't just the right thing to do, we recognized that it was a good investment. Each dollar invested in publicly funded family planning programs saves the government over $7 in Medicaid-related costs.  The other side rails against Medicaid spending. In fact, last week, they had a bill that cut it by about $850 billion. But if they succeed on this vote today, Medicaid spending will almost certainly rise as a result of what they are trying to do.  We supported title X funding with both Republican majorities and Democratic majorities in the Now a narrow majority is trying to ram this measure through.  This isn't supported by a consensus of Americans, and you know it is not when Vice President Pence has to drive over here from the White House to cast a tie-breaking vote. Just yesterday, the Vice President was at a White House forum on women's empowerment. It begs the question: Did he learn anything at the forum?  It is easy for Senators, apparently, to vote against healthcare for struggling I wonder sometimes whether the reason for that is that we are not affected by this vote. That is doubly true when 50 Senators--overwhelmingly men--vote to cut healthcare for millions of low-income women.  The vote today has real consequences for If this measure passes, it will threaten to cut funding for title X health centers serving over 52,000 men, women, and teens each year. It will also risk funding for the over 20 Planned Parenthood clinics throughout Colorado that provide healthcare services to more than 86,000 men, women, and teens. Planned Parenthood is a critical part of Colorado's healthcare system, providing essential services in a quarter of the State's counties. This support is especially vital for our rural areas. Two weeks ago, I visited Alamosa and Durango, CO, where these health centers are some of the only places women can turn to for preventive care and family planning services.  We should not do this. Pediatricians are against it. Family physicians are against it. Nurses are against it. But on the other side, we have a narrow majority voting to strip funding for vital primary and preventive care, including breast cancer screenings and HIV testing.  I would invite anyone voting against this measure, including the Vice President, to come to Alamosa and Durango and see what these health centers are doing in our communities. I invite them to come and meet the people they help, the lives they change.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure. It will hurt many of our fellow It will hurt women in my State and particularly working people, and it should not pass.  I yield the floor.

828,topic-id,410,"Mr.Speaker, I have several objections to the legislation being considered today. As with the Secret Science Reform Act, the bill would seriously undercut the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to use science to inform their work.  The bill would prohibit the EPA from using any scientific findings when the EPA did not have total access to the underlying data. This would eliminate some of the best available science from being considered by the  Let me be very clear, there is nothing secret nor dishonest about relying on voluminous, peer-reviewed studies published in the most credible scientific journals in the world to make public health decisions.  Equally problematic, the bill would force the EPA to grant full access to any scientific data it does possess, including highly sensitive materials like trade secrets and personal health histories. Much has been made about the ability of the EPA to redact this information, but there is a piece of legislation that says: By simply signing a nondisclosure agreement at the discretion of the EPA administrator, you can have access to all of the nonredacted information.  We talk about the accountability of the What is the accountability of violating a simple nondisclosure agreement? It becomes so easy for these private health information trade secrets to be sold for a small fortune on the black market. It certainly doesn't make sense to provide such an easy avenue to potential bad actors.  I would also like to object to the title of the legislation and the implication that EPA employees and scientists are somehow not honest. Many of those folks live in Virginia, and, frankly, I am tired of Members of Congress bad-mouthing my constituents. These are[[Page H2540]]hardworking public servants who have dedicated their lives to clean air, clean water, and to our good health. And I want to reassure the many wonderful employees of the EPA that, in Congress, we do, in fact, appreciate your good work on behalf of the American people.  Lastly, much like the TrumpCare bill we almost considered last week, there is no CBO cost estimate. The chairman mentions that he has asked the CBO to use a different methodology. The last one they said was going to cost us hundreds of millions of dollars to implement. It is hard to imagine anything where the EPA has been required to fund or acquire data that is not going to be unreasonably expensive relative to anything before.

1029,topic-id,379,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform  Madam Speaker, H.1431 is a blatant attempt to cripple the important mission of the EPA by stacking the EPA Science Advisory Board with industry insiders.  When Congress established the Science Advisory Board in 1978 to review the scientific data that informs the EPA's regulatory process, they did that with the requirement that the Board be balanced with representatives from industry and academia. The legislation we are considering today would skew that balance in favor of industry, with the intent of slowing down the EPA's regulatory process.  With a significant respect for the vice chair from Oklahoma, it makes no sense to suggest that the representatives of regulated corporate interests, however expert, can be credibly described as ``defenders of scientific integrity.''  I am particularly concerned about the double standard mandated by this bill. On the one hand, the bill makes it easier for industry representatives to serve on the Board by only requiring that they disclose their conflicts of interest. There is no recusal requirement for industry insiders, no matter how deep their financial ties may go or how much their industry is regulated by the But, astonishingly, on the other hand, the same scientists and researchers who received EPA research grants or contracts are automatically disqualified from service. Any scientists or researcher would be precluded from accepting any grant or contract for 3 years after their service.  So the scientists who spent their whole career becoming the world's top experts on a given topic must choose between advising our public health or continuing their research. They can bring their knowledge to the EPA and give up that work or continue.  Why oh why would we make it more difficult for the scientists and academic experts to participate in the Science Advisory Board while at the same time making it easier for industry experts to participate? Why would we want less science on the Science Advisory Board?  This proposal does nothing to advance science or protect public health. Instead, it creates senseless hurdles, burdensome red tape for the Science Advisory Board, and makes it more difficult to achieve its mission. We need to let scientists and researchers do their jobs by opposing this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgH2564-6.txt,2272,BILLION IN DOMESTIC SPENDING,2017.0,30.0,March

The HONEST Act pushes forward the basic principles of the scientific method, which is critically important in instances in which science and Federal Government policy intersect.  Regulations put forward by the EPA impact all Americans, including my constituents in the East Valley of the Greater Phoenix area, the four cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, and So it is imperative that the citizens of this country be able to see the data that underpin these rules. What is even more important is that the scientific community be able to scrutinize EPA data to ensure that the Agency is using the best available science, regardless of the administration.  Critics of the HONEST Act claim that scientific data underpinning EPA's regulations are already subject to the standards of peer review. While this may be true, peer review of scientific studies is not adequate because this process seldom involves a close scrutiny of the data used in these studies. Peer review rarely double-checks the analysis, and very rarely does it attempt to actually replicate the results of a study. Right now, we can only hope that the individuals conducting the science can be trusted with their results.  The EPA should promote the use of rigorous science, not questionable science. Those who say that peer review is adequate are misguided. The American people deserve better than that, and the HONEST Act ensures that their expectations are met.

64,topic-id,1022,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today to speak in favor of the American Health Care Act, a bill that repeals many of the worst aspects of ObamaCare, and begins to repair the damage caused by the law by bringing choice, competition, and patient-centered solutions back into our healthcare system.  Standing here today in the House debating this bill is a proud moment for me. I was working as a nurse in Nashville in the 1990s when, fresh off of the failure of HillaryCare, the Clinton administration pushed out a single-payer pilot program in Tennessee called  As the story goes, Vice President Gore and the Democratic Governor sketched out a program on a napkin while sitting in a local bar. I saw firsthand the negative impact of government-run health care on patient care. I saw the costs rise, and the quality of care fall. I saw the burdens being placed on doctors, patients, hospitals, and care providers. I saw patients faced with fewer choices and more regulation. And I saw the devastating impact that TennCare was having on our State's budget, gobbling up so much State spending that other priorities like education and infrastructure were getting squeezed.  I couldn't sit idly by while this was happening in my State, so I decided to get involved in public service, and it is what inspired me to run for office at the very beginning. And when, in 2009 and 2010, I saw the same principles being debated and eventually implemented on the national level, I thought my experience in Tennessee would be valuable to the national debate. I told the people in my district that, if elected to Congress, I would fight to repeal and replace  In 2011, I sponsored the first piece of legislation that repealed a part of And today, we take the largest step yet in rescuing the American people from the damage that has been done by  We are united in our goal to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered health care. Right now, ObamaCare is imploding. We were promised premiums that would decrease by $2,500; instead, average family premiums in the employer market have soared by $4,300.  We were promised healthcare costs would go down; instead, deductibles have skyrocketed.[[Page H2406]]  We were promised we could keep our doctor, and keep our health insurance plans; instead, millions of Americans have lost their insurance and the doctors that they liked.  In short, the Affordable Care Act was neither affordable, nor did it provide the quality of care that the American people deserve.  The American Health Care Act is a first step in our efforts to deliver patient-centered healthcare reform. This bill returns to the American people freedom and choice in their healthcare decisions. It gets government out of the relationship between patients and their doctors--where it has never belonged--and puts people back in charge of their own health care. It brings the free market principle of competition to an industry that has long been dominated by government intervention.  Today we are faced with a stark choice: Do we vote to continue the damage ObamaCare is doing to our country and our constituents, or do we vote to go down another path, a better way of doing health care in this country?  While no legislation is perfect, this bill does accomplish some important reforms. It zeros out the mandates. It repeals taxes. It repeals the subsidies. It allows people to choose health insurance plans that are unique to their families, instead of purchasing a one-size-fits-all plan that is mandated by some Washington bureaucrat, and it modernizes Medicaid, a once-in-a-lifetime entitlement reform.  Ending Medicaid's open-ended funding structure will play an important role in addressing the future budget deficits and our growing national debt. I applaud my colleagues who have stayed in this fight and continue to make this bill better.  The members of the Budget Committee, which I chair, outlined four principles they believed would improve the bill. Those principles led to significant changes to allow more State flexibility in Medicaid and ensure that tax credits truly served the people they are meant to serve.  Others fought to eliminate Federal ObamaCare regulations that drive up the cost of health care for all Americans and give those powers back to the At the same time, we also ensure that States have the resources to provide maternity and newborn care and treatment for mental health and substance abuse.  I agree with these changes, and I applaud my colleagues for the work to make sure that we truly reverse the damage ObamaCare is doing to our healthcare system and our economy.  ObamaCare's legacy is clear: more government, less choice, and higher costs. Our vision for health care in America is the opposite: more freedom, more choice, and lower costs. Put simply, the American Health Care Act is a good first step, but it is only a first step.  My good friend and our former colleague, Tom Price, will use his position as Secretary of Health and Human Services to address some of the regulatory burden of ObamaCare through administrative action. We have voted already and will continue to vote on individual pieces of legislation to implement even more patient-centered, free market reforms that we cannot address through reconciliation.  In fact, we just passed two bills already this week. One would allow small businesses to join together to purchase insurance, and the other would increase competition by tearing down antitrust regulations. That bill received 416 votes. This shows that these bills are commonsense measures that include bipartisan support.  The day is finally here where we have an opportunity to fulfill that promise that we have made to the American people. I, for one, cannot sit idly by and let this opportunity go to waste. Campaigning is easy compared to governing, but our constituents did not elect us to do what is easy. They elected us to do what is right.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the American Health Care Act, to rescue the American people from  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

66,topic-id,337,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I remind the gentleman from Kentucky that every promise made to the American people in support of ObamaCare was rapidly broken. We are now, at this moment in time, watching the death throes of  More people are paying the State tax penalty or claiming hardship exemptions than are buying ObamaCare policies. In a third of our counties, there is no choice left at all. You get one provider. Soon, we are warned, some regions will have no providers at all. Premiums soared an average of 25 percent last year, and this year we are warned it could be 40 percent or more.  Critics cite the CBO estimate that 24 million Americans will lose their coverage. It is important to understand their reasoning there. The CBO believes that people won't buy health insurance unless we force them to buy health insurance. In fact, people won't buy health insurance that is not a good value for them, and, clearly, ObamaCare isn't.  We replace it with a vigorous buyer's market where plans across the country will compete to offer consumers better services at lower prices tailored to their own needs and wants. And we assure these plans are within their financial reach with $90 billion of additional support that the CBO simply ignores.  The AHCA's biggest achievement is to replace coercion with choice for every It ends the individual mandate that forces Americans to buy products they don't want. It ends the employer mandate that has trapped many low-income workers in part-time jobs. It begins to restore consumers' freedom of choice, the best guarantee of quality and value in any market. It allows Americans to meet more of their healthcare needs with pretax dollars. It relieves the premium base of the enormous cost of preexisting conditions by moving them to a block-granted assigned risk pool.  Mr.Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing, premiums are skyrocketing, and providers are fleeing. This may well be our last off-ramp on this road to ruin.

90,topic-id,420,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to recognize that our Members on the other side of the aisle are sharing some data on the coverage of per congressional district based on a study that was conducted by the Center for American Progress, which is a left-leaning organization to begin with. The Center for American Progress employs a flawed methodology for estimating this coverage. In[[Page H2411]]fact, their foundational numbers are actually based on CBO's coverage estimates, estimates that the CBO itself has established are not infallible.  These coverage numbers only take into account plans that they consider comprehensive major medical policies. This is a term that is used in the very law that we are trying to dismantle today. These coverage estimates do not account for things that we have in our bill, such as HSA plans that allow purchase with tax credits, and many medical plans.  So the AHCA increases freedom for Americans to purchase the kind of coverage that works for them, not the narrowly defined coverage that we see that the Federal Government likes.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock), who is a member of our committee.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I simply want to underscore what the chairwoman has already laid out.  When my friend from Kentucky says that his constituents will lose coverage, he is basing it on two premises. He is ignoring the $90 billion of additional funds that we freed up in the Budget Committee to assure that nobody will face sticker shock as we make this transition.  Second, he assumes that the only reason that people buy insurance is if we force them to buy it. The reality is many are refusing to buy ObamaCare policies even when they are faced with these crushing tax policies. The AHCA replaces this heavyhanded and failing bureaucratic nightmare.  Ultimately, we are going to be judged not on polls or fairy tales, but on whether the vast majority of Americans have a better experience with this new consumer-driven market than they had with the bureaucratized, one-size-fits-all ObamaCare system. That system has already been weighed in the balance and found wanting by the American people, and I am here to stake my reputation on the prediction that they will find better policies with better services at lower costs when they are restored the freedom to be consumers in a marketplace with a supportive tax structure that assures that these policies are within the financial reach of every American family.

105,topic-id,400,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to remind my fellow colleagues that, currently, when we look at the access to care for people, one-third of our counties only have one provider; two-thirds of our counties only have two providers. In my State of Tennessee, there are 14 counties where they will have no insurance provider on the marketplace. So when we talk about people losing their insurance, they are losing their insurance by not having access to even purchase the insurance.  One of my former colleagues, the gentleman from Minnesota, asked: What are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying to preserve?  I want to point to this chart here to ask that question, because these are the broken promises of  Why are you trying to preserve something where they say premiums will decrease by $2,500, and we see the average family premiums have soared by $4,300, making insurance unaffordable for many families?  Another broken promise: the cost of health care will go down.  We see some deductibles that have gone up as much as 60 percent. In my own State, they have gone up by 63 percent, making coverage unaffordable.  You can keep your doctor--70 percent of the plans consist of narrow networks, which means they cannot keep their doctor. I cannot tell you the number of people who have called me because their doctor was not on their inept plan.  Finally, ``middle class Americans won't see a tax increase.'' This was a promise by former President ObamaCare penalties were put in place, so people are receiving a tax penalty.  These are the broken promises that the other side of the aisle wants to continue to protect. As opposed to that, we[[Page H2415]]want a system that is going to be open with patient care and give affordability so people can get the services that they want with a cost that they can afford.

Your legislative proposals are consistent with the      President's commitment to repeal the Affordable Care Act;      provide advanceable, refundable tax credits for Americans who      do not already receive such tax benefits through health      insurance offered by their employers; put Medicaid on a      sustainable path and remove burdensome requirements in the      program to better target[[Page H2434]]     resources to those most in need; empower patients and put      healthcare dollars and decisions back into their hands by      expanding the use of health savings accounts; ensure a stable      transition away from the Affordable Care Act; and protect      people with pre-existing conditions.       Achieving all of the President's goals to reform healthcare      will require more than what is possible in a budget      reconciliation bill, as procedural rules on this type of      legislation prevent inclusion of key policies such as selling      insurance across state lines, lowering drug costs for      patients, providing additional flexibility in Medicaid for      states to manage their programs in a way that best serves      their most vulnerable citizens, or medical legal reforms.

We support the Repeal of Obamacare       Obamacare is collapsing. If we do nothing, people will lose      access to health care coverage. As it stands now, one-third      of the counties nationwide have only a single insurance      carrier. Americans in these areas have essentially no      choices, while they watch their premiums rise dramatically.      The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 28 million      Americans will lose coverage over the next decade if changes      are not made to the Affordable Care       As the Affordable Care Act continues to deteriorate, and as      insurance premiums skyrocket across the nation, opposition to      this failed policy grows.

Similarly, Bill Clinton called ObamaCare, ``. . . the      craziest thing in the world.'', adding that people ``wind up      with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.''

544,topic-id,876,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I do rise today in support of S.34, which disapproves of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to protecting the privacy of customers of broadband and other telecommunication services.  I applaud Senator Flake's work on this issue, as S.34 was passed by the Senate last week. I also filed a companion resolution in the  The FCC finalized its broadband privacy rules on October 27, 2016. At that time, they assured us that the rules would provide broadband customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and stronger security protections for their personal information collected by internet service providers, but the reality is much different.  There are three specific problems with which the FCC has gone about these rules. First, the FCC unilaterally swiped jurisdiction from the Federal Trade The FTC has served as our Nation's sole online privacy regulator for over 20 years.  Second, having two privacy cops on the beat will create confusion within the internet ecosystem and will end up harming consumers.  Third, the FCC already has authority to enforce privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis. These broadband privacy rules are unnecessary and are just another example of Big Government overreach. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that Federal regulations cost our economy $1.9 trillion in 2015.  Since President Trump took office, Republicans have been working diligently to loosen the regulatory environment that is suffocating hardworking taxpayers.  Here is what multiple House Democrats said in a letter to the FCC last May regarding the FCC's privacy rules:       The rulemaking intends to go well beyond the traditional      framework that has guarded consumers from data practices of      internet service providers and ill-served consumers who seek      and expect consistency in how their personal data is      protected.  Further, FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright testified before Congress that the FTC has unique experience in enforcing broadband service providers' obligations to protect the privacy and security of consumer data. He added that the rules will actually do less to protect consumers by depriving the FTC of its longstanding jurisdiction in the area. Once again, these rules hurt consumers.  Incredibly, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to the internet as the most powerful and pervasive network in the history of the planet before these rules were even created. I found this really odd because it implied that the FTC regulation had indeed been successful and ought to continue, ultimately undermining his own rationale for additional FCC privacy regulation.  Now, there are a couple of myths that are going around that I want to take the time to dispel. Our friends claim there will be a gap for ISPs in the FCC privacy rules when they are overturned. This simply is false, and let me tell you why. The FCC already has the authority to enforce the privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis.  Pursuant to section 201 of the Communications Act, they can police practices of the ISPs that are unjust or unreasonable. Sections 202 and 222 also protect consumers. It is already in statute. So I encourage my friends to read title II of the Communications Also, the State attorneys general have the ability to go after companies for unfair and deceptive practices.  Third, litigation is another avenue consumers can pursue against ISPs for mishandling personal data. Service providers have privacy policies. If they violate the policy, guess what? They can be sued. I know Democrats will certainly understand that, as they have many trial lawyer friends, and I urge them to speak to the trial bar.  Fourth, the free market is another great equalizer. Can you imagine the embarrassment for an ISP that is caught unlawfully selling data? We have all seen the economic fallout from something such as a data breach. Companies have a financial incentive to handle your personal data properly because to do otherwise would significantly impair their financial standing.[[Page H2490]]  To my Democrat friends across the aisle, the bottom line is this: the only gap that exists is in these arguments that you have made.  Consumer privacy is something we all want to protect, and consumer privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create, as the Democrats Rush, Schrader, and Green indicated in a letter to the FCC last  I also want to speak, for just a moment, on the edge providers because there has been some question about who has visibility into your data. Clinton administration veteran privacy expert Peter Swire offered a report in February 2016 titled ``Online Privacy in ISPs.''  ISP's access to consumer data is limited and often less than access to others. Swire found that ISPs have less visibility into consumer behavior online than search, social media, advertising, and big tech companies.  Swire's study found that, as a result of advancing technologies, the rise of encryption, and the various ways and locations individuals access the internet, ISPs now have increasingly limited insight into our activities and information online.  By contrast, however, so-called edge providers, like search engines, social media, advertising, shopping, and other services online, often have greater visibility into personal consumer data.

968,topic-id,2087,"Mr.President, I am here on behalf of 55 million working Americans who lack access to retirement savings plans through their employers. These numbers underscore a very, very uncomfortable truth for many Americans--that there is a looming retirement crisis in our  Congress must do more to preserve, protect, and strengthen retirement savings for all I come to the floor to express my strong opposition to the legislation before us, which would do precisely the opposite.  H.67 would tear down ongoing efforts at the State and municipal levels to assist, not obstruct, hard-working Americans in preparing for financially stable and rewarding retirements.  I also want to express my very deep concern about efforts by my Republican colleagues to force a vote on H.66 in the very near future. I would advise my colleagues to reconsider their taking action on both of these misguided proposals right away.  While many private sector employers have the option to set up and their employees have the choice to contribute to their own retirement savings accounts, fewer than 10 percent of workers who are without access to a workplace plan contribute to retirement savings accounts outside of their employers.  To address this growing issue, in August of 2016, under the guidance of the Obama administration, the Department of Labor promulgated what has become known as the State-sponsored auto-IRA rule. This rule provides critical guidance for States on how to administer programs that are designed to improve access to retirement accounts among private sector employees. These State-facilitated retirement programs would allow State governments to provide automatic enrollment in State-sponsored IRA programs, with there being the opportunity to opt out at any time.  There are misguided and progressive proposals that seek to overturn the critical rulemaking that protects Americans in this process. If passed, these resolutions, very simply, will cripple ongoing efforts on the State level to ensure that retirement savings opportunities are more readily available for all workers.  In my home State of Connecticut, we have led efforts to find secure and innovative ways to address the growing retirement savings gap for nearly 600,000 working people in Connecticut who lack access to employer-based retirement savings. The Connecticut Retirement Security Authority has led this effort. It was created in 2016, and it is based on almost 2 years of market research, public hearings, meetings, and broad input from employers, potential participants, and representatives of the financial sector.  We are moving in the right direction in Programs that represent a strong step in the right direction have been fostered and built by encouraging State facilitation with private providers. These plans allow workers access to secure, low-cost retirement savings accounts in That effort would be set back by these proposals to undercut and reverse progress made at the Federal level. Incomprehensibly, these bills would severely undercut efforts to promote State and city auto-IRA programs. It is a blatant attack on these programs and[[Page S2095]]on working families in Connecticut and elsewhere.  I urge my colleagues who believe that Congress should spend time in expanding, not limiting, access to innovative solutions to the American savings crisis to join me in opposing these resolutions.  They have broad economic implications. They set back job creation as well as economic progress. There are 55 million individuals--many of them in Connecticut--who lack the ability to save for retirement directly from their paychecks. This gap is exacerbated by the fact that nearly 20 percent of people between the ages of 55 and 64 have, virtually, zero in retirement savings. That is true of Connecticut and every State in our country.  A lack of retirement savings leads to disastrous results and jeopardizes access to adequate meals, healthcare, and other necessities. Simply put, no American family and, certainly, no Connecticut family should be deterred or discouraged from planning for the future by saving responsibly.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on H.66 and H.67 because States and municipalities should have the flexibility to implement proven strategies to support hard-working Americans who wish to prepare themselves for retirement.                Russia and Trump Campaign Investigation  Mr.President, I find in Connecticut--and, I am sure, my colleagues find around the country--that Americans are outraged and appalled by Russia's disinformation campaign that has been waged against our free and fair electoral process. There is no question now--the intelligence agencies have confirmed it--that Russia interfered in the campaign of this latest election.  Our electoral process is the bedrock of our democracy. Russian interference in our election is an attack on our democracy. Indeed, it is an attack on Some believe--and I join them in this concern--that it is an act of war.  As appalling as the Russians' actions have been, I am equally--if not more--concerned about the ``see no evil, hear no evil'' attitude of this administration. It was aided in its election by Russia's campaign of disinformation, malign theft, its dissemination of private data, propaganda, and cyber attack. That cyber attack was unconscionable and unprecedented in its scope and scale.  Our Nation's intelligence community has provided chilling and absolutely horrifying confirmation of this Russian interference in our democracy. Yet the White House continually dismisses these reports. This week, we are learning that they actually may be actively interfering with and trying to redirect efforts by Congress to discover the full extent of Russia's cyber intrusion.  The bottom line here is that only a special prosecutor at the Department of Justice can apply sunlight and conduct a vigorous, independent investigation. Only a special prosecutor can remove this stain on our democracy. Only a special prosecutor can provide our Nation with assurance that wrongdoing will be effectively investigated and then charged and prosecuted. Only a special prosecutor can give us the closure we need and deserve.  Every day, evidence mounts pointing to the need to investigate these Russian ties and contacts with the Trump campaign. The more we learn, the more troubled and outraged the American people become.  Just this week, revelations have surfaced that Representative Nunes, chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the House, met on White House grounds with a source who showed him secret American intelligence reports that he then used to defend President Trump's claims that his closest associates were under surveillance by the Obama administration. That this information actually came from a meeting at the White House has intensified questions about where the information actually originated and whether the President's team is actually meddling in the congressional investigation. Chairman Nunes's actions have fatally tainted the House Intelligence Committee investigation and infected it with the virus of partisan bias.  Just yesterday, we also learned, based on letters obtained by the Washington Post, that the Trump administration sought to block former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the House investigation, adding additional taint. We all recall she is the one who blew the whistle on the real risk of General Flynn being blackmailed by the Instead of thanking her, the President fired her. After firing her for doing her job, the administration is now intent on stopping her as a witness from revealing exactly what the President knew about his adviser's ties to foreign interests.  The House investigation is incontrovertibly compromised by having a Trump surrogate running and organizing it and the administration--at least in appearance and likely in reality--controlling its access to the facts.  There is a growing body of evidence that clearly and unmistakably indicates that the Trump campaign and his associates were in contact with Russia during the election, and these deeply troubling claims of coordination with a foreign government to influence an American election deserve exacting and aggressive investigation.  The declassified report from the intelligence community clearly identifies Russia Today as a state-sponsored propaganda source that was integral to Putin's campaign to interfere in that election, and it makes it equally clear, and deplorably so, that former National Security Advisor Flynn accepted $45,000 to praise Russia Today in Moscow and dine with Putin at the network's request.  We know as well that Attorney General Sessions and Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and now senior adviser, had unreported meetings with Russian officials, including the head of a Russian bank under U.sanctions. The President's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, funneled millions of dollars into offshore accounts from a Russian oligarch through the Bank of Cyprus, which was owned at the time by Wilbur Ross, now serving as the President's Commerce  These contacts form a network of facts and suspicion, but more than suspicion, there are real sources of information and facts. As Ronald Reagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.''  These disclosures are all the more reason--indeed, compelling evidence--that a special prosecutor is necessary to investigate Russia's ties and contacts with the Trump campaign. Immediate, aggressive measures to hold Russia accountable and deter further aggression must be taken. Those actions must be based on facts as well, but we must acknowledge publicly that the need for deterrence requires effective responses, appropriate and necessary measures to send a message and inflict the kind of cost that is necessary to show Russia that we will never accept these kinds of attacks. At stake is not only Russia's view of this country and deterrence to further attacks but also the credibility and trust of the American people in the Department of Justice, and that is where a special prosecutor is absolutely vital.  I support the work of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, and I trust the members of that committee to do their work responsibly. I believe as well that we should have a select committee--or, even better, an independent commission--that will make findings of fact, produce recommendations, have public proceedings, and then, in the interest of full transparency and disclosure, produce a report with recommendations that will help provide a path to avoid these kinds of attacks on our democracy in the future and potential collusion between Americans and those attacks.  I believe that an independent commission would serve a worthwhile purpose, but neither the Intelligence Committee, nor a select committee, nor an independent commission can do what is equally important, which is prosecute wrongdoers. None of these bodies, whether congressional or independent commission, can investigate criminal wrongdoing so as to assure an effective and successful prosecution. That work must be done with the FBI and supervision of an independent, special prosecutor who can investigate vigorously and independently and then take action and bring charges if they are warranted.  I support the investigation of the Intelligence Committee, which should do its work, the appointment of a select committee that can produce findings of fact and a report and recommendation,[[Page S2096]]and an independent commission that can do the same kind of public, transparent, open disclosure. A special prosecutor does not produce a report; they and the team will produce a prosecution, if it is warranted. They are the only ones who can prosecute.  We cannot stand idle while Russia interferes and threatens our political infrastructure, which now includes our electoral system. Neither can we stand idle while our Department of Justice is leaderless or, worse yet, has a prosecutor who also may be tainted by the fact that he reports to the Attorney General or to the The Attorney General has recused himself, with good reason, because he was implicated in allegations surrounding collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian interference.  The allegations of collusion are serious. They must be investigated, and the investigation and potential prosecution must be done by someone who is independent--a special prosecutor. Revelation upon revelation day after day leaves us with no choice. In fact, we had no choice well before now, but the disclosures that have surfaced just within the last hours and days confirm that justice will not be vindicated unless we have a special prosecutor. That is why I have chosen to block the nomination and confirmation of the Deputy Attorney I will consider doing it with other nominees as well. I feel so strongly--and I hope my colleagues do as well--that a special prosecutor is necessary to vindicate justice, to make sure that Americans have trust and confidence in our Department of Justice and in the ability of the United States to protect its democracy and the integrity of its electoral process.

1165,topic-id,1352,"Mr.President, I rise today in a near empty Indeed, there is no Republican colleague here today. Our Republican colleagues have yielded back all their time on this resolution, and the reason they have yielded back all their time is that they apparently have no interest in appearing here and talking about a resolution of disapproval of a rule that is vital to ensuring that women have access to the family planning provider of their choice. It is really that simple.  Defending Planned Parenthood is what we have done on this side. Defunding Planned Parenthood has been the interest on the other side of the aisle.  They have also taken an inordinate interest in reinstating gender ratings in health insurance and are now damaging title X networks through this resolution. They have demonstrated an unmitigated desire to cut women's access to healthcare in order, apparently, to win political points. But their actions today show that the politics of this issue and, most importantly, the people of America are not on their side.  Title X is a critical program delivering important family planning and preventive health services in underserved areas of our great In 2015 alone, title X programs provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services. We are talking about Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing for more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers across the country. For 40 percent of women, their visit to a family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive annually. Think of that number for a moment. Forty percent of those women have no access elsewhere except at these healthcare centers.  By overriding this regulation, Republicans will allow States and title X grantees to pick and choose who provides these services based on arbitrary criteria that have nothing to do with the quality of services patients will receive. It is no wonder that none of them is here to talk about it. Now, if they were here--and they have said so in public--they might argue that they support this resolution because they oppose abortion. So let me be clear. This regulation is about access to family planning services, not about access to abortion.  I know many of my colleagues disagree with me that abortion should be safe and legal. They have shown that disagreement by their repeated attempts to undermine Roe v. Wade and make it harder for women to access constitutionally protected healthcare.  While they may disagree, it is still the law of the land. In any event, this regulation is not about access to abortion. This regulation is about ensuring that States cannot discriminate against qualified providers that are an essential part of a safety net that serves women who have no place else to go. Those providers are willing to provide necessary, culturally sensitive care to individuals who otherwise would simply be without access to that care.  Title X funding does not go to abortion services. It goes to provide much needed family planning services. There is so much that the title X program does that I believe my colleagues would agree is absolutely vital to the health of women. I know we agree on wanting to reduce teen and unintended pregnancies. Without the contraceptive care provided by title X sites, the teen pregnancy rate would be 30 percent higher and the unintended pregnancy rate would have been 33 percent higher. We should agree on that point.  We should also agree on wanting to find ways to save money in the healthcare system. In 2010, health services provided at title X centers resulted in net savings of $7 billion in Federal and State funds. Those savings are indicative of the fact that every dollar invested in publicly funded family planning saves taxpayers $7. That is a great deal for the taxpayers of our That is a humane and profoundly significant deal for the women whose lives are bettered. We should all agree that preventing disease and saving health and lives is not only about dollars and cents. It is about the future of our  Title X began as a bipartisan program to support family planning services over 40 years ago, an era that was less divisive and when this Chamber was less divided. I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of ensuring these services. States cannot restrict an already overburdened network of safety net providers.  Family planning services are provided through State, county, and local health departments, as well as hospitals, family planning councils, Planned Parenthood, and federally qualified health centers. Providers that focus on reproductive health comprise 72 percent of all title X-supported sites, and they are critical to delivering high-quality family planning services.[[Page S2124]]They are particularly able to offer the full range of contraceptive methods and to help women start and effectively use the methods that will work best for them individually.  There is simply no excess capacity in that safety net system now. For Republicans to allow States to remove providers from the networks based on arbitrary criteria is simply unwise and, in fact, unconscionable. The foundation of the program's success is the longstanding intent that its provider network be designed by the communities it serves to help patients have access to trusted, highly qualified, family planning providers.  Just a few weeks ago, I met with some providers and volunteers from Planned Parenthood of North I was deeply impressed with their dedication, their skill, and their humanity. In a high-need, low-income community like North Hartford, access to primary care is limited. Young men and women who come to this clinic have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, depression, high blood pressure, and headaches. Left untreated, they have to be addressed at emergency rooms at much higher costs.  The clinicians recognized that there was an additional need for health services and for other providers in the community to meet them, but they were currently unable to do so. So they decided to initiate full-scope primary care services in Hartford, in addition to the comprehensive women's health services, so as to fully serve the men and women who choose to come to Planned Parenthood of North Hartford for their reproductive health and family planning care needs.  Patients there are seen for acute conditions and chronic problems, physicals, preventive vaccinations, as well as services to quit smoking. If there were ever a cost-effective program anywhere in the United States, then the North Hartford project is a sterling example.  Just to give one example, recently, a young woman came to this Planned Parenthood for birth control. She was found to have high blood pressure. So her provider started her on blood pressure medication and counseled her on dietary and lifestyle changes. She started exercising regularly and improved her diet, lost 30 pounds, and no longer needed the medication to control her blood pressure. Is that kind of treatment cost effective? The facts speak for themselves--the real facts--giving patients a choice, giving them a chance, giving them the counseling and care they need to save dollars and save lives.  Community healthcare centers like that in North Hartford simply cannot accommodate all the family planning patients who would lose coverage or funding if title X funds to Planned Parenthood affiliates, like Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, are eliminated. That is a lesson of this Planned Parenthood that is undeniable.  That may well be why our Republican colleagues have yielded back all of their time.  The real facts are undeniable. The real need is irrefutable. My colleagues and I are here today not because we are asking for more money or a change in how the funding program is used. We are standing up and speaking out against shortsighted efforts that would restrict access to family planning services for some of the most vulnerable patients--many of them voiceless in these halls; faceless, otherwise--in areas that are least able to absorb this cruel and inhumane change in the rules.  I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution and to stand strong for women's and men's healthcare across the country.  I yield the floor.

675,topic-id,1504,"Mr.President, I come today to talk about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme Once again, throughout the hearings last week, Judge Gorsuch proved that he has the knowledge, he has the temperament, and he has the experience to serve on our Nation's highest He laid out a clear judicial philosophy that adheres to what I think most Americans want to see happen today on the Court and what clearly the Framers of the Constitution thought would happen.  In his own words, Judge Gorsuch said: ``I have one client, it's the law.'' That is the way the Founders saw the Supreme They didn't see it as a legislative body. All good judges had to do was to read the law. They didn't have to be happy with the law. They didn't have to approve the law. They didn't have to determine that the law and the Constitution met their exact standard. They just had to determine what the law and the Constitution said. In fact, the first Supreme Court had six judges. There was no thought that it was a legislative body that had to have a tie-breaking judge so you could legislate.  They thought six judges were plenty. By the way, they thought they needed six circuits. Each of those judges rode a circuit. So even when there was an appeal to the Supreme Court, one of the judges had already heard the case at the lower level. That judge heard the case again and then listened to see if that judge heard anything new, something that might change their mind. The other five of them were sitting there with the appeal of one of their colleagues, and nobody saw that as a problem because the Court wasn't about legislating.  The Court was about determining what the law should say. Again, Judge Gorsuch said: ``I have one client, it's the law.'' It is not the little guy. It is not the big guy. It is not the medium-size guy: It is the law. He was asked over and over: Are you going to find for the little guy or the big guy? Well, that is not the judge's job. The judge's job is to read the law so both the little guy and the big guy know when they are in court that this is a country where the rule of law matters. They know, when they enter into a contract, that if you and your lawyer have read the law right, there shouldn't, at the end of the day, be very much gray space about what that contract said.  Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated his commitment to interpret the Constitution as it is written, applying the rule of law and not legislating from the bench. ``Judges are not politicians in robes.'' I think that may be another Gorsuch comment: ``Judges are not politicians in robes.'' If he didn't say it, his career as a judge shows that he believes it. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have shown that their deference to the Constitution is not the same when it[[Page S2023]]comes to the Senate's role to advise and consent.  I am particularly dismayed by the Democratic leader's intention to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination. Republicans have never filibustered a Democratic nominee, yet colleagues across the aisle appear willing to do just that. Such a maneuver would only be an affront to our national norms.  I don't know in the history of the country--I think there was one filibuster led by Democrats against a nomination by a Democrat President when Lyndon Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to move from Associate Justice to the Chief Justice's role. It didn't happen in 1968 because it was a Presidential year and Justices don't get confirmed in the Supreme Court in a Presidential year in vacancies that hadn't even occurred yet. 2, it was led by Democrats in a Senate that had an overwhelming Democratic majority. There has never been a partisan filibuster effort involving any Justice on the Supreme Court until right now--until right now--and I am disappointed that that is what the Democratic leader of the Senate says he wants to do.  According to Robert David Johnson, a Brooklyn College history professor, ``The chances of success'' of a partisan filibuster ``are basically zero.'' So my thought would be: Why pursue it?  Kim Strassel recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal: ``Never in U.history have we had a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.''  In the last half century, only three Supreme Court Justices have even faced a filibuster. The most recent, Justice Alito, was ultimately confirmed when 19 Democrats refused to back the filibuster of his nomination. He had the full vote, and he got a majority vote.  One would think that if Senate Democrats are willing to upend Senate tradition to block this nomination, they would have an unassailable reason to block it. They would be saying this judge is not qualified. This judge hasn't served his time. We don't know what he would do as a judge. He has been on the circuit court of appeals for a decade, and when looking at case after case, appeal after appeal, we see his unbelievably fine record as a judge.  In announcing his intention to mount this filibuster, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate said that Judge Gorsuch ``was unable to sufficiently convince me that he'd be an independent check'' on the executive branch. The American Bar Association unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch's nomination their highest rating. They disagree. As they explained, ``based on writings, interviews, and analyses we scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong but respectful voice in protecting it.''  This is from the American Bar Association, which many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said over and over again is the ultimate test of qualification for the  When I met with the judge last month, he left no doubt in my mind that he would uphold the judiciary's unique constitutional role in our system of checks and balances.  Let me go back to the other quote here for a minute. What was it that the Senator from New York said? ``Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he'd be an independent check'' on the executive branch. I am not even sure I know where in the Constitution that is the job of the judge. The job of the judge is to read the law and look at the The job of the Congress is to pass the law. The job of the President is to sign the law. Unless there is some constitutional problem with that law, it is not the judge's job to decide whether the law is right or not, unless there is a constitutional reason to do that.  Last week, I mentioned Judge Gorsuch's qualifications for the bench, but I think they bear repeating as we enter the next few days. As a graduate of Columbia University, a graduate of Harvard Law and Oxford University, his academic credentials are at the highest level. Judge Gorsuch has served his country admirably as a Supreme Court clerk, first for a Democrat on the Court, Byron White, who had been appointed by President Kennedy, and for a Republican appointee, Anthony Kennedy, appointed by President He has been the principal Deputy Associate Attorney General of the United States at the Department of Justice, and in 2006, George Bush nominated him to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of The Senate unanimously confirmed his position at that time. Every single Democrat--12 of them now serving in the Senate who were in office, supported his nomination in 2006. In the decade that he served on the Tenth Circuit Court, he has shown independence, integrity, and he has shown a mainstream judicial philosophy. He has demonstrated a legal capacity that makes him a worthy successor to Justice Scalia on the There is no precedent for requiring a 60-vote threshold to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, and Judge Gorsuch has given this body no reason to demand one now.  I look forward to supporting his nomination. It will reach the Senate floor, I believe, after the Judiciary Committee deals with it early next week. I hope by the time we leave here a week from Friday that Judge Gorsuch is on his way to join the Supreme Court as an Associate By the way, if he does that, he will be the first Associate Justice ever to serve on the Court with a Justice for whom he clerked two decades or more ago. When he and Justice Kennedy get a chance to serve together--I look forward to seeing that happen.

947,topic-id,680,"Mr.President, I certainly agree with the comments just made by our friend from Oklahoma in looking back at the history of the The 200 years of giving judges a vote really is an important thing for us to understand, as hopefully enough Members of the Senate decide between now and sometime next week that the up-or-down vote--where they get to vote however they want to--is totally appropriate.  I would like to speak about one other topic that we are dealing with this week. I was here yesterday to talk about Judge I will likely be back again before this debate is over because it is critically important that he be confirmed.  Mr.President, I want to speak for just a minute about what we are also doing this week under the Congressional Review One of the reasons the Court matters is that the Court gets to decide on occasion whether an agency has the legal ability to make a rule, but just because they may have the legal ability to make a rule doesn't mean they should make a rule that stands if the Congress doesn't agree.  The Congressional Review Act, under the late rulemaking of President Obama, has had a real opportunity to work for, I would say, the first time, but the truth is, it has worked one other time in 2001. In the 25-or-so-year history of the Congressional Review Act until the last few days, the last few weeks, it has been utilized only because it is really only practically available to the Senate and to the House if there are midnight rules, rules that come up at the last minute.  As of today, the Senate has already passed 11 resolutions that have disapproved those late rules that came in the final days of President Obama's administration. By the time we finish this process, I think we will be toward a total of maybe 15 rules that would have had a real impact on our economy, that would have had a real impact on job creation, that would have had a real impact on families. Those rules are not going to happen because of the Congressional Review  I have been an opponent of many of these rules and many of the regulations we have seen over the last 8 years, but they have often been able to become law anyway because the Congress, frankly, couldn't do anything about it.                            Title X Program  In particular, I would like to commend Senator Joni Ernst for her work on the resolution of disapproval we expect to consider tomorrow. Senator Ernst's resolution would simply restore the ability of States to set their own criteria for grant recipients under the title X program.  I would like to remind my colleagues that this rule was issued on December 19, 2016. It took effect January 18, 2017, 2 days before the end of President Obama's administration. So for 7 years and 363 days, the Obama administration didn't need this rule, but they issued it on the way out the door.  Overturning this rule would not reduce a single dollar of funding that is available under title Again, all we are doing is simply giving back to the States the flexibility they had until the last 48 hours of the Obama administration to determine which health providers were in the best position to provide the particular set of healthcare services before the rule took effect.  This rule is another example of overreach. This is another example of out-of-control regulators. I certainly am pleased to see Senator Ernst bring it to the floor.  The determination of how the rules should be made and who should make them and who should do something about it is something that this Congress, in the next few weeks, has to take a stronger stand on.  I hope we find a way where we have to vote on every rule that has any significant economic impact. That bill has passed the House of Representatives already.

1174,topic-id,569,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the title X It is just a continued abuse of power, something we have never seen in this body--one after another, after another, along party-line votes--to overturn rules and overturn decisions that this government has made. It is disgraceful that this body is debating yet another effort that will threaten a woman's right to healthcare.  Title X ensures that women across the country have access to affordable healthcare, including family planning at clinics that are convenient and affordable. These are a vital resource for preventive care and for primary care.  Overturning this rule will allow States to discriminate against providers, allow States to pick and choose and potentially put thousands of healthcare centers out of business. We know that because we have seen this kind of activity in some State legislatures. These clinics are often the only places women and men have to turn to for basic health services.  Why do this in the same week that the House, fortunately, failed to throw 20 million people off of health insurance and throw off 200,000 Ohioans who are getting opioid addiction treatment and who have insurance because of the Affordable Care Act? The House did not do that, but now the Senate wants to do this? Again, it compromises people's healthcare, as it takes away, in some cases, their insurance and, in other cases, their clinics and health services they cannot get elsewhere.  Some 6 in 10 women who turn to title X for visits to family planning health centers say it is their regular source of healthcare. Many of them have nowhere else to turn. They either cannot afford healthcare elsewhere or they live too far away from another health center for there to be meaningful access to basic healthcare.  Let's be clear. This is not about defunding abortion, clearly. The Federal Government does not provide funding for abortions. I will say that again. The Federal Government does not provide funding for abortions, period. I support a woman's right to make a personal, private healthcare decision for herself and with her doctor. No matter your personal feelings about abortion, whether you call yourself pro-choice or pro-life or something else, surely, we can agree that cancer screenings and programs that have helped bring down Ohio's teen pregnancy and STD rates are a good thing. Cutting these services will have a real and serious impact on women and families across  If these actions by men--and it is, overwhelmingly, by men in Washington--whose healthcare is paid for by taxpayers continue to chip away at women's healthcare access, we will see more undiagnosed cancers, more untreated illnesses, and more unintended pregnancies.  I emphasize again that these are mostly men in this body, or men down the hall in the other body, who are voting--men with insurance that is paid for by taxpayers. Their insurance is subsidized by tax dollars. Last week, down the hall, they voted to take away healthcare--in this case, mostly for women but also for men--for people who are getting opioid treatment.  In case after case, privileged Members of this body, who get insurance paid for by taxpayers, take healthcare services away from, literally, millions of It is shameful. It is morally questionable. It is something we, simply, should not do.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

At that time, I was a practicing physician, and I could foresee the disastrous consequences of this law and what it would do to patients across this country, including my own. And I wasn't alone.  Citizens from every corner of America stood up and demanded that Congress reject the ObamaCare bill, but we were ignored. Since then, out-of-pocket costs for families have skyrocketed, patient-choice has evaporated, and ObamaCare has inched closer to the brink of collapse.

It is an opportunity for us to fulfill our promise to our constituents. Let's be clear: a vote against this bill today is a vote for preservation of the ObamaCare disaster, a vote to keep critical healthcare decisions in the hands of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and a vote against the largest entitlement reform in a generation.

766,topic-id,694,"Mr.Speaker, you can divide this country into two classes of people, not Republican and Democrat but the political class and the rest of the country. The political class is doing better than ever.  Eleven out of 20 of the richest counties in America are in the D.metro area. For every dollar the average family in D.earns, the average family in Davie County, where I live, earns 55 cents.  The political class is alive and doing well for themselves. On the other hand, those who are not oriented to government--doctors, auto mechanics, waitresses, bartenders, factory workers--are still earning exactly what they did 10 years ago. I am not the first person to point this out, but I want to speak about a textbook example of how this dynamic plays out in reality.  I am referring to a recently announced $418 million arms deal between the U.and It is for 12 airplanes that are essentially armed crop dusters. There is only one slight problem with the deal, the defense contractor that was chosen to fulfill the sale doesn't even make these type of airplanes. They have never done it before. In fact, there is an extra $130 million built into this deal to design a whole new airplane.  IOMAX USA, a service-disabled, veteran-owned small business in my district, makes these airplanes. They have been doing it for 7 years. They have got 50 of these airplanes in the Middle These planes have dropped more than 4,000 bombs on They are the only U.manufacturer of this type of aircraft.  They were not even considered for the deal, which was awarded without competition. Nobody got a chance to bid. Nobody knew about it, except for the company that got it and the bureaucrats who were involved.  That is how the D.area got so wealthy. If you know the right people and you have the right lobbyists, you get awards like this from the Federal Government without competition. It doesn't matter if you don't even make the product, they will give you some extra money to design it from scratch if you know the right people.  IOMAX, a small business just like the millions of others in our country, doesn't have those connections. The giant defense contractor involved in this deal does, and so they get the money. Something is wrong with that picture.  The problem lies with a secretive acquisition unit within the Air Force called Big Now, I don't say ``secretive'' lightly.  At one point in 2013, Big Safari's commanding officer told a reporter: Don't be angry or upset when your Freedom of Information Act gets turned down; that is just they way we do business here at Big And the commander's words were true.  I asked for information on this, and they turned me down saying that the information was sensitive, but unclassified, and for official use only. I asked them 19 questions, and they answered only four of them having to do with the very basic elements for the deal that were already public.  Under that secrecy, Big Safari doles out billions in government contracts. I imagine it makes things convenient for when Big Safari employees go to work for the same companies to which they direct these large defense contracts, which we have found that they do with some regularity. You don't even have to go to a different building, in some instances. We have got a confirmed case of a Big Safari employee awarding a contract, quitting, and then going to work on the same program with the same company he has just given the contract to.  The forgotten men in this equation are the employees of IOMAX, mostly veterans, mostly blue collar, who have to compete against a $13 billion defense contractor and a $4 trillion Federal Government that appears to have forgotten impartiality.  We need to shine the light on this deal with congressional oversight, and we need to ask ourselves who exactly the Federal Government is supposed to be working for, the country or for the political class.

21,topic-id,5327,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, we all know why we are here--the problems that exist within the Affordable Care It is simply not working for the American people--limited choice, costs going up, and millions without access to care. Unfortunately, these are not just talking points, but real issues affecting real  The Affordable Care Act has damaged the individual market. It has driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing one-third of all United States counties with only one insurer. And among the plans that have chosen to remain in the markets, there have been widespread, double-digit premium increases.  The individual markets are a death spiral and are failing to live up to the promises made 7 years ago--that Americans would be able to receive affordable health care. As we knew then, and we know now, this was an empty promise that has left an estimated 19.2 million Americans without coverage. What is worse, these individuals are forced to pay the individual mandate penalty or seek a hardship exemption because of the costs to purchase and use health insurance.  Nine months ago, Mr.Speaker, we began our Better Way plan to save the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the American people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the American Health Care Act, laid out the policies to stabilize the collapsing insurance markets and to repeal the more burdensome Affordable Care Act taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited access to care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care Act does.  First and foremost, it provides immediate relief to the State insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that one-size-fits-all works for no one and certainly did not work for the individual markets. The States should have the flexibility to support their insurance markets and ensure that plans can continue to provide options for coverage.  To do this, we relaxed two of the egregious market regulations that were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that premiums cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3-to-1 ratio, and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.  The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has driven up the cost for coverage for younger and healthier Americans and has pushed away those seeking coverage by the millions. Of the 19.2 million Americans who have sidestepped the individual mandate, it estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals are under the age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking coverage, the markets have further plunged into death spirals, as insurers hike up premiums year after year.  To change this, we are relaxing the ratio to 5-to-1. It will lower premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize the markets.  Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage options.                              {time}  0930  To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient and State Stability This fund provides States with $100 billion over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to lower cost and increase access to health care for unique patient populations in each The goal is simple: to provide States with maximum flexibility as to how they address the cost of care for their citizens.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the Stability Fund and other proposed changes to the market would reduce premiums by 10 percent by calendar year 2026. We all want patients to have access to high-quality, affordably priced coverage. The Patient and State Stability Fund can help to lower costs.  In Medicaid, in addition to supporting the insurance market, the American Health Care Act provides needed reforms to the Medicaid program. Without changes, the Medicaid expansion alone is expected to cost $1 trillion over the next decade. Medicaid desperately needs reform so that States can continue to provide coverage to children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups.  To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases out the Medicaid expansion, the expansion that has crippled State budgets and limited States' ability to ensure that[[Page H2377]]resources will continue to be available for those vulnerable populations.  Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by shifting programs toward per capita allotments. The per capita allotments, an idea that originated during the Clinton administration, will set limits on the annual cost for growth for per capita expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the Federal  The American Health Care Act increases the amount of flexibility that States have in managing their Medicaid programs. The bill scales back the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a State's ability to tailor their plans to the needs of their beneficiaries. States can and should be trusted to manage the needs of their beneficiaries, and this bill allows States to do that.  Additionally, the bill before us today furthers the goal of providing the States with greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs by providing States with the option to implement two additional opportunities: work requirement and block grants for  This time around we chose to engage our State counterparts in the discussion and listen--listen--to their input as we designed this bill. At the top of their list were the desire to see the work requirement built in and the opportunity to work with Medicaid as a block grant.  We don't tell them what to do. They are given the permission to do what they feel is best for their citizens. Republicans trust the States and trust the Governors and the elected leaders in those  Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases in the community health center funding, offers enhanced funding to support safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and ends the cuts to the disproportionate share hospital payments.  We are committed, Mr.Speaker, to ensuring that our local providers can continue to deliver lifesaving care. The American Health Care Act turns this commitment into action. For millions of Americans in rural and medically underserved areas, these actions will provide needed relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care  Let me just say, Mr.Speaker, it has been an interesting process. We had a 27\1/2\-hour markup in the Energy and Commerce We have had over 15 or 16 hours in the Rules This bill has been almost talked to death. I want to just acknowledge that I appreciate the input of the administration. I appreciate the fact that the directive to us last night was to put our pencils down and turn our papers in.

Repealing this provision could hasten the insolvency of      Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare's ability to      pay for services in the future.                           Prescription Drugs       Older Americans use prescription drugs more than any other      segment of the U.population, typically on a chronic basis.      We are pleased that the bill does not repeal the Medicare      Part D coverage gap (``donut hole'') protections created      under the Since the enactment of the law, more than 11.8      million Medicare beneficiaries have saved over $26.8 billion      on prescription drugs. We do have strong concerns that the      American Health Care Act repeals the fee on manufacturers and      importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is      projected to add $25 billion to the Part B trust fund between      2017 and 2026. AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce      the burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and      taxpayers and is willing to work with you on bipartisan      solutions.                  Individual Private Insurance Market       About 6.1 million older Americans age 50-64 currently      purchase insurance in the non-group market, and nearly 3.2      million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for      health insurance coverage through either the federal health      benefits exchange or a state-based exchange (exchange). We      have seen a significant reduction in the number of uninsured      since passage of the ACA, with the number of 50-64 year old      Americans who are uninsured dropping by half.       Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical      to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access      health care. A typical senior seeking coverage through an      exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and      already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for health care.      We have serious concerns that the bill under consideration      will dramatically increase health care costs for 50-64 year      olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to      the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that      requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more      than younger individuals) to 5:1 and reductions in current      subsidies for older       Age rating plus premium increases equal an unaffordable age      tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change showed      that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to      $3,200 for a 64-year-old, while reducing premiums by only      about $700 for a younger enrollee. Significant premium      increases for older consumers will make insurance less      affordable, will not address their expressed concern of      rising premiums, and will only encourage a small increase in      enrollment numbers for younger persons. In addition, the bill      proposes to change current subsidies based on income and      premium levels to a flatter tax credit. The change in      structure will dramatically increase premiums for older      consumers. We estimate that the bill's changes to current      law's tax credits could increase premium costs for a 55-year-     old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a 64-     year-old earning $25,000 that increase rises to more than      $4,400 a year, and more than $5,800 for a 64-year-old earning      $15,000. When we examined the impact of both the tax credit      changes and 5:1 age rating, our estimates find that, taken      together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much      as $3,600 for a 55-year-old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000      for a 64-year-old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for      a 64-year-old earning $15,000 a year. In addition to these      skyrocketing premiums, out-of-pocket costs could      significantly increase under the bill with the elimination of      cost sharing assistance in current law. The cost sharing      assistance has provided relief on out-of-pocket costs (like      deductibles and certain benefits) for low-income individuals      who are some of the most financially vulnerable marketplace      participants.              Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports       AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act      that create a per capita cap financing structure in the      Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions      could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of      individuals who depend on the essential services provided      through Medicaid is a vital safety net and      intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals,      including over 17.4 million low-income seniors and children      and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for      critical health care and long-term services and supports      (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily[[Page H2378]]     activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing      medications, and transportation).       Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65      and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly      Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults      living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor      or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and      Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost      33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a      relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a      disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid      spending.       Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults      rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and      community based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily      activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home      modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as      hearing aids and eyeglasses. People with disabilities of all      ages also rely on Medicaid for access to comprehensive acute      health care services. For working adults, Medicaid can help      them continue to work; for children, it allows them to stay      with their families and receive the help they need at home or      in their community. Individuals may have low incomes, face      high medical costs, or already spent through their resources      paying out-of-pocket for LTSS, and need these critical      services. For these individuals, Medicaid is a program of      last resort.       In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,      this approach to financing would likely result in      overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and      families unable to shoulder the costs of care without      sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to      program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming      some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens. In terms of      seniors, we have serious concerns about setting caps at a      time when per-beneficiary spending for poor seniors is likely      to increase in future years. By 2026, when Boomers start to      turn age 80 and older, they will likely need much higher      levels of service--including HCBS and nursing home--moving      them into the highest cost group of all seniors. As this      group continues to age, their level of need will increase as      well as their overall costs. We are also concerned that caps      will not accurately reflect the cost of care for individuals      in each state, including for children and adults with      disabilities and seniors, especially those living with the      most severe disabling conditions.       AARP is also opposed to the repeal of the six percent      enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the      Community First Choice (CFC) CFC provides states with      a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and      people with disabilities live in their homes and communities      where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want      to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as      possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in      Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost      of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could      disrupt services for older adults and people with      disabilities in the states that are already providing      services under       AARP has concerns with the removal of the state option in      Medicaid to increase the home equity limit above the federal      minimum. This takes away flexibility for states to adjust a      Medicaid eligibility criterion based on the specific      circumstances of each state and its residents beyond a      federal minimum standard.       Although we cannot support the American Health Care Act, we      are pleased that the bill does not repeal some of the      critical consumer protections included in the Affordable Care      Act, such as guaranteed issue, prohibitions on preexisting      condition exclusions, bans on annual and lifetime coverage      limits and allowing families to keep children on their      policies until the age of 26. Also, AARP does support      restoring the 7.5 percent threshold for the medical expense      deduction which will directly help older Americans struggling      to pay for health care, particularly the high cost of nursing      homes and other long-term services and supports.       We look forward to working with you to ensure that we      maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust      insurance market protections, controls costs, improves      quality, and provides affordable coverage to all           Sincerely,                                              Joyce Rogers,                                            Senior Vice President,     Government                                  ____                Vote NO to the American Health Care Act       The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on      the American Health Care Act (AHCA).       Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other      populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced      that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and      the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural The      AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural      America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more      uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure      crisis.       Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill will      improve the base bill, including increased tax credits for      Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 who would have seen      their premiums skyrocket under the current plan, the National      Rural Health Association is concerned that the bill still      falls woefully short in improving access and affordability of      health care for rural Additionally, the new      amendments to freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of      1, 2018, and reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will      disproportionately harm rural       The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural      Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved      populations in our nation without coverage, and further      escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to      the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit      rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the      largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times      reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--     lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of      the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid      under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable      Care Act.''       Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed rural      The lack of plan competition in rural markets,      exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op      collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating      Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a      health care crisis in rural However, it's beyond      frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is      squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be      created in rural       Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural      health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect      it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain      access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America      are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to      protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements      are critical for rural patients and providers:       1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-     expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are      covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).       Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is      different and thus requires different programs to succeed.      Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not      `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and      targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for      millions of rural patients and financial stability for      thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal      health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect      its rural safety net providers. The federal government must      not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities      to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to      care.       Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access      to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a      state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a      matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to      create stability among rural providers to maintain access to      care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent      to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,      a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is      provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued      access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not      limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective      Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health      Service providers, and individual rural providers.       2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace      enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing      70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack      of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.      Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34      for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).       Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,      cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to      participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,      poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural      Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and      less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.      Rural communities have fewer health care providers for      insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to      serve the community.       Any federal health care reform proposal must address the      fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural      markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies      are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for      participation and are currently not obliged to provide      service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.      Demographic realities of the rural population make the market      less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance      company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the      same way that financial service institutions are required to      provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable      insurance companies should be required to provide services in      underserved communities.       3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals      serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),      thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the      board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad      debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable      health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot      afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has      actually increased[[Page H2379]]     50% since the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ``Average      Medicare margins are negative, and under current law they are      expected to decline in 2016'' has led to 7% gains in median      profit margins for urban providers while rural providers have      experienced a median loss of 6%.       If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to      protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be      undone. The National Rural Health Association implores      Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the      nation.                                  ____                                               American Society of                                           Addiction Medicine,                                     Rockville, MD, March 8, 2017.     Kevin Brady,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Brady, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Neal      and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf of the American Society      of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the nation's oldest and largest      medical specialty society representing more than 4,300      physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in      the treatment of addiction, I am writing to share our views      on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) that is being      considered by the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce      committees.       ASAM is very concerned that the AHCA's proposed changes to      our health care system will result in reductions in health      care coverage, particularly for vulnerable populations      including those suffering from the chronic disease of      addiction, and we cannot support the bill in its current      form.       More than 20 million Americans currently have health care      coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including      millions of Americans with addiction. This coverage is a      critical lifeline for persons with addiction, many of whom      were unable to access effective treatment before the ACA's      expansion of Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults, and      its requirement that Medicaid expansion plans and plans sold      in the individual and small group market provide essential      health benefits (EHB) including addiction treatment services      at parity with medical and surgical services.       We are concerned that rolling back the Medicaid expansion,      sunsetting the EHB requirements for Medicaid expansion plans,      and capping federal support for Medicaid beneficiaries will      reduce coverage for and access to addiction treatment      services, changes that will be particularly painful in the      midst of the ongoing opioid epidemic. Moreover, while the      AHCA retains the EHB requirements for private plans, it      repeals the ACA's actuarial value requirements for those      plans. We are concerned that this could result in insurers      offering addiction treatment benefits in name only due to      higher costs and/or less robust benefits.       The Medicaid expansion in particular has led to significant      increases in coverage and treatment access for persons with      addiction. In states that expanded Medicaid, the share of      people with addiction or mental illness who were hospitalized      but uninsured fell from about 20 percent in 2013 to 5 percent      by mid-2015 and Medicaid expansion has been associated with      an 18.3 percent reduction in unmet need for addiction      treatment services among low-income adults. Rolling back the      Medicaid expansion and fundamentally changing Medicaid's      financing structure to cap spending on health care services      will certainly reduce access to evidence-based addiction      treatment and reverse much or all progress made on the opioid      crisis last year.       To be sure, ASAM supports flexibility in the Medicaid      program and has supported several states' applications for      1115 waivers to transform their addiction treatment systems      to offer all levels of care described by The ASAM Criteria;      Treatment Criteria for Addictive, Substance-Related, and Co-     Occurring However, ASAM has seen for decades how      states underfund addiction treatment services and waste      federal dollars on inefficient and ineffective care when they      are left to decide how to manage their federal Medicaid      dollars without mandates for parity and accountability to      cover appropriate care. Based on this experience, we      commended the Congress for requiring accountability for the      $1 billion in funding sent to the states to combat the opioid      epidemic authorized by 21st Century This funding is an      additional lifeline to suffering communities, but it will      come to an end while patients will continue to need treatment      for the chronic disease of addiction. When it does, the      Medicaid program must continue to fund appropriate addiction      treatment at parity with medical and surgical services.       ASAM has long advocated for broad access to high-quality,      evidence-based, individualized and compassionate treatment      services for persons suffering from the chronic disease of      addiction. The critical need for access to this type of care      has been heightened and highlighted by our nation's ongoing      epidemic of opioid addiction and related overdose deaths. The      ACA's Medicaid expansion, EHB requirements for addiction      treatment coverage, and extension of parity protections to      the individual and small group market have surely reduced the      burden of this epidemic and saved lives. As you consider this      legislation, we hope that parity protections will continue to      apply individual, small and large group plans as well as      Medicaid plans through the transition. Finally, throughout      this process, we implore you to keep in mind how your      decisions will affect the millions of Americans suffering      from addiction who may lose their health care coverage      entirely or see reductions in benefits that impede access to      needed treatment.           Sincerely,     Jeffrey Goldsmith, MD, DLFAPA, DFASAM,       President, American Society of Addiction                                  ____                                 American Medical Association,                                      Chicago, IL, March 22, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Due to projections      that enactment of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) will      result in millions of Americans losing health insurance      coverage, the American Medical Association (AMA) must express      our opposition to the proposal currently before the House of      The need to stabilize the individual      insurance market and make other improvements in the      Affordable Care Act is well understood. However, as      physicians, we also know that individuals who lack health      insurance coverage live sicker and die younger than those      with adequate coverage. We encourage all members of Congress      to engage in an inclusive and thorough dialogue on      appropriate remedies. We cannot, however, support legislation      that would leave health insurance coverage further out of      reach for millions of       Earlier this year, we shared with Congress key health      reform objectives that we believe are critical to improving      the health of the nation. Among these objectives are ensuring      that those currently covered do not lose their coverage,      maintaining market reforms, stabilizing and strengthening the      individual insurance market, ensuring that low and moderate-     income patients are able to secure affordable and adequate      coverage, and ensuring that Medicaid and other critical      safety net programs are maintained and adequately funded.      While we appreciate that the bill's authors have made efforts      to maintain some market reforms and that regulatory efforts      are underway to strengthen the individual insurance market,      as a whole the legislation falls short of the principles we      previously outlined.       Health insurance coverage is critically important. Without      it, millions of American families could be just one serious      illness or accident away from losing their home, business, or      life savings. The AMA has long supported the availability of      advanceable and refundable tax credits, inversely related to      income, as a means to assist individuals and families to      purchase health insurance. The credits proposed under the      AHCA are significantly less generous for those with the      greatest need than provided under current law. The reduced      purchasing power with the AHCA tax credits will put insurance      coverage out of reach for millions of       We also remain deeply concerned with the reduction of      federal support for the Medicaid program and the resulting      significant loss of coverage. Medicaid expansion has provided      access to critical services, including mental health and      substance abuse treatment, for millions. Not only will the      AHCA force many states to roll back coverage to these      millions of previously ineligible individuals, but the      significant reduction in federal support for the program will      inevitably have serious implications for all Medicaid      beneficiaries, including the elderly, disabled, children, and      pregnant women, as well.       We also continue to be concerned about provisions that      eliminate important investments in public health, and those      that inappropriately insert the federal government into      personal decisions about where Americans are allowed to      access covered health care services.       We continue to stand ready to work with Congress on      proposals that will increase the number of Americans with      quality, affordable health insurance coverage but for the      reasons cited above, urge members to oppose the American      Health Care           Sincerely,                                              James Madara,  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I just want to say to my colleague from Texas, he said this bill was talked to death.

The Federal Communications Commission issued its Open Internet Order, reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers, which brought them under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications The Federal Trade Commission is the primary regulator of companies' privacy and data security practices; however, the Federal Trade Commission's regulatory authority under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act does not extend to common carriers. Therefore, the reclassification of broadband internet service providers as common carriers created a legal enforcement gap.  The Federal Communications Commission determined that the privacy provisions of the Communications Act would now apply to broadband internet service providers and that new and expanded privacy rules were necessary. Therefore, the Federal Communications Commission promulgated new privacy rules for common carriers on October 27, 2016. These rules were adopted a mere 10 days before the 2016 Presidential election. They were adopted on a party-line vote and over serious objections by the minority Commission members and the internet service providers. The Federal Communications Commission's rules are a departure from the privacy protections that have been applied by the Federal Trade Commission for years.  The Federal Trade Commission employs an opt-out model that requires companies to provide consumers notice of the data that is collected and how it will be used. Consumers are then given the option to opt out of this data collection if they so choose. Instead of implementing well-established collection practices that are accepted industrywide, the Federal Communications Commission chose to promulgate an opt-in model for its new internet service providers. This model prohibits broadband internet service providers from using, disclosing, or providing access to customer proprietary information without the customer's affirmative opt-in consent. Such data includes browsing history, application usage, and location data, among other types of information.  While this may sound like a good thing to opt in to, in reality, it unfairly skews the market in favor of providers that already have access to consumer information. For example, search engines, social media sites, and internet content providers like Netflix, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, these providers, known as edge providers, are free to collect consumer data that broadband internet service providers, under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, are not. The ability to provide consumer data drives the digital advertising market.  The Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules arbitrarily treat internet service providers differently from the rest of the internet, amounting to government intervention in the free market. The Federal Communications Commission stated that the rules would provide more transparency, the rules would provide more choice, the rules would provide more protection; however, these expanded provisions may also result in more frequent breach notifications, leading to a weaker focus on security by consumers who do suffer from notification fatigue.  While the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules were meant to protect consumers, they actually can inhibit security and market competition while creating confusion by subjecting parts of the internet ecosystem to different rules and different jurisdictions. To correct this policy, on March 23, 2017, the Senate passed S.34, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to nullify the privacy rulemaking promulgated by the Federal Communications  Prior to the reclassification of broadband internet service providers as common carriers under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission regulated companies' privacy practices while preserving the Federal Communications Commission's authority to enforce privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis.  This Congressional Review Act will restore the status quo that existed prior to the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet Order and bring the privacy practices of all parts of the internet back into balance. Not only will this level the playing field for an increasingly anticompetitive market, but it will ensure parity in the protection of consumer data.  The new Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has called to halt the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules. He stated: ``All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules. . . . The Federal Government shouldn't favor one set of companies over another.'' This is precisely the type of limited government that we should be striving for after years of overreaching by the previous administration and its regulations. The Congressional Review Act protects consumers, and it restores the free market competitiveness that actually allows our economy to thrive.  The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more apparent than over the past 2 months, where this Congress has needed to step in and remove burdensome, unbalanced regulations put in place by the prior administration and their team just as they were walking out the door.  House Republicans today will stand up for the rights of our constituents against the out-of-control Federal bureaucracy.

The parent company of one of the largest edge providers is valued at over $500 billion. He points out in his blog post, by way of comparison, the nation of Singapore's gross domestic product, the entire output for every man, woman, and child in a very productive country is $508 billion. Basically, the same. So the edge provider stands on equal financial footing of the world's 40th richest country.  By way of contrast, the Nation's largest internet service provider has a net worth of $148 billion.

530,topic-id,735,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.  I include in the Record an op-ed from The Wall Street Journal from March 1, 2017, by Jeff Flake, a member of the other body. The title of the op-ed is ``Settling a Bureaucratic Turf War in Online Privacy Rules.''              [From The Wall Street Journal, 1, 2017]        Settling a Bureaucratic Turf War in Online Privacy Rules                            (By Jeff Flake)       When you shop online from your tablet or browse the      internet on your smartphones, you expect your personal data      to be secure. Technology companies invest billions of dollars      on data security to protect consumer privacy.       Privacy is also a cornerstone of consumer protection, with      federal enforcement agencies striking an appropriate balance      between innovation and security in their regulations. But      just as a flawed line of code can render a new firewall      program useless, the new privacy rules that were rushed      through in the waning days of the Obama administration risk      crashing our longstanding privacy-protection regime.       For two decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been      America's sole online privacy regulator. Under the FTC's      watch, our internet and data economy has been the envy of the      world. The agency's evidence-based approach calibrates      privacy and data-security requirements to the sensitivity of      information collected, used or shared online, and applies      protections in a consistent and evenhanded way across      business sectors. Consumer behavior demonstrates the success      of the FTC's regulatory approach: Each day people spend more      time engaging in online activities.       But in 2015, in a bid to expand its own power, the Federal      Communications Commission short-circuited the effectiveness      of the FTC's approach by reclassifying internet service      providers as common carriers, subject to Title II of the      Communications       In taking that unprecedented action, the FCC unilaterally      stripped the FTC of its traditional jurisdiction over      The FTC can no longer police the privacy practices of      providers, leaving us with a two-track system under which the      FCC applies its own set of rules for ISPs while the FTC      monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem.       Even after the 2015 power grab, the FCC could have simply      adopted as its own the FTC's successful sensitivity-based      model of privacy regulation. Instead--after last year's      election--the FCC finalized privacy regulations that deviate      extensively from the FTC framework in several key respects.       The FCC rules subject all web browsing and app usage data      to the same restrictive requirements as sensitive personal      information. That means that information generated from      looking up the latest Cardinals score or checking the weather      in Scottsdale is treated the same as personal health and      financial data.       The new rules also restrict an ISP's ability to inform      customers about innovative and cost-saving product offerings.      So much for consumer choice.       The FCC's overreach is a dangerous deviation from      successful regulation and common-sense industry practices.      But don't just take my word for it. The FTC concluded that      the FCC's decision to treat ISPs differently from the rest of      the internet ecosystem was ``not optimal--agency-speak for      ``a really bad idea.''       Outside of the FTC's well-founded concerns, the new rules      are also a departure from bipartisan agreement on the need      for consistent online privacy rules. President Obama noted in      2012 that ``companies should present choices about data      sharing, collection, use, and disclosure that are appropriate      for the scale, scope, and sensitivity of personal data in      question at the time of collection.'' In other words, privacy      rules should be based on the data itself.       But that's not how the FCC sees it. The commission's rules      suffocate industry and harm consumers by creating two      completely different sets of requirements for different parts      of the internet.       To protect consumers from these harmful new regulations, I      will soon introduce a resolution under the Congressional      Review Act to repeal the FCC's flawed privacy rules. While      the resolution would eliminate those rules, it would not      change the current statutory classification of broadband      service or bring ISPs back under FTC jurisdiction. Instead,      the resolution would scrap the FCC's newly imposed privacy      rules in the hope that it would follow the FTC's successful      sensitivity-based framework.       This CRA resolution does nothing to change the privacy      protections consumers currently enjoy. I hope Congress and      the FCC will continue working together to address issues of      concern down the road. However, it is imperative for rule-     making entities to stay in their jurisdictional lanes. We      need to reject these harmful midnight privacy regulations      that serve only to empower bureaucrats and hurt consumers.

But just as a flawed line of code can render a new firewall program useless, the new privacy rules that were rushed through in the waning days of the Obama administration risk crashing our longstanding privacy-protection regime.''

Former Democratic President Bill Clinton said this about ObamaCare:  `` . . . the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half, and it's the craziest thing in the world.''  I tend to agree with President Clinton on this. ObamaCare is crazy. But for far too many Americans, it is the crazy reality they face every day.  So today is about a rescue mission. Today is about bringing relief to the families who are struggling under this failed law. Today it is about passing the American Health Care  ObamaCare is on a collision course with disaster.

After a duty station transfer to Korea, Gary returned and graduated with a communications degree from Washington State Shortly after graduation, Gary started with Battelle, a company that had a contract for a research and development lab located at That lab provided crucial services during the Cold War and is now known as Gary went on to work for Westinghouse on the Fast Flux Test Facility, the Washington Public Power Supply System, and spent time with the International Nuclear Safety Program, a cooperative nuclear energy safety effort between the U.and Soviet After retiring from Battelle in 2002, Gary served on the Tri-City Development Council, TRIDEC, an organization dedicated to improving the economic health of the Tri-Cities area.  During his 14 years at TRIDEC, Gary has been a relentless supporter for DOE's missions at Hanford and PNNL and a champion for the larger Tri-City community and our State by ensuring important projects received needed Federal resources. Gary is the type of constituent every member hopes to have in their communities back home--a very involved citizen. He has been a strong advocate for the issues that matter to the people of Washington while also understanding the importance of communicating with his political representatives. My relationship with Gary has been invaluable, and he has been instrumental in many of my proudest career accomplishments.  Gary shares my vision for why establishing the Manhattan Project National Historical Park was so important. We worked together for many years to champion and ultimately see the creation of the Manhattan Project National Historical The legislation I authored preserved the central landmark of the Hanford site and the park, the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production nuclear reactor ever built and a tremendous technological achievement for its time. The park also includes the Bruggemann Agricultural Warehouse, the White Bluffs Bank, the historic Hanford High School, and the Hanford Irrigation District's Allard Pump Visitors from 70 countries have already visited the B Reactor, demonstrating the uniqueness of the park and the curiosity people have about this chapter of American and world history. We all owe Gary a debt of gratitude for the establishment of this park.  Today the Tri-Cities is home to a vibrant agricultural industry, some of the best healthcare available, two colleges that are training workers to meet the varied needs of the region's businesses, increasing wine tourism, and a newly expanded airport. Gary has touched all of these projects and many more.  I am incredibly proud to have worked with Gary and to call him a friend. Gary, thank you for all of your years of advocacy for the Tri-I join Washingtonians in thanking him for his longstanding service and wish him and his wife, Margaret, all the best in the future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2149-2.txt,172,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,30.0,March

Why would you want to give out any of your personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purchase of them selling it?  Give me one good reason why Comcast should know what my mother's medical problems are. Do you know how they would know? Because when I went to the doctor with her and they told me what it was, I had no clue what they were talking about, so I came home and I searched it on the net, and I searched the drugs that she was taking. The same with my children.  Just last week, I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take, or the color, or any of that information?                              {time}  1345  These companies are not going broke. That is not the situation.

It is mine, not yours, not the government's--mine. You can't have it unless I give it to you.  My phone number, my Social Security number, my credit card number, my passwords--everything is mine. Yet you just want to give it away. You make one good argument: let's level the playing field. You are right. I agree with you. But you don't level the playing field by getting rid of the playing field. You level it by raising it on those who are not subject to this rule.  Please give me one--not two--one good reason why all of these people here, why all of these people watching would want Comcast or Verizon to have information unless they give it to them. We are talking medical information. We are talking passwords. We are talking financial information. We are talking college applications. There is nothing in today's society that every one of us doesn't do every day on the internet, yet Comcast is going to get it--not because I said it is okay.  And what are you going to do with it? Kind of look at it and say: oh, yeah, hey, Mike takes a size 38 underwear. That is great. They are going to sell it to the underwear companies. Hey, he bought this kind of underwear. He likes this color. Let's give him ads. By the way, most of those ads are useless, because I already bought the underwear. I don't need any more.  But it is none of their information. It is none of their business. Go out in the street, please, leave Capitol Hill for 5 minutes. Go anywhere you want, find three people on the street who think it is okay, and you can explain to them ROIs, the company has to make progress, and we have to make money.

They keep a record of where you go. They keep a record of whether you wore your seatbelt. They keep a record of whether you applied the brakes or turned the turn signal on. That is your automobile. You don't have to drive.  Just recently, in the last couple months, we have learned that our televisions and children's dolls are doing the same thing. Last month, it was revealed that Vizio had spied on 11 million consumers by listening to them while their TV was off because they can do it.  Also, last month, a child's doll called My Friend Cayla for little girls or boys was banned in Germany--banned in Germany--because that doll listens and responds. It goes into the internet, and the doll's owner keeps and sells that information.  This month--this month--a teddy bear manufactured by a company called CloudPets was exposed for collecting more than 2 million voice recordings of children talking to their teddy bear.  Now, maybe we accept that. I know that those are not the items that this resolution would address, but the problem is you are taking an item for ISPs and reducing it down to this level. You say your privacy is protected. I just gave you three examples in the last 2 months where your privacy is not protected. Neither is your children's. Neither is your family's.

It contained an infrared sensor and even take your body temperature with a thermographic--and that is a quote--thermographic camera. It would do all this without telling you and would work whether the cable box was on or not. If you don't believe me, if you still have the courage to go on the internet, go find patent application number--now, write this one down--2012/0304206. That is the patent application number.

One of my proudest achievements during that time was working in a bipartisan way to create a program that reduced the rate of uninsured children in our county by over 90 percent--all before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Since the Affordable Care Act, I saw firsthand the direct and positive impact of this legislation over the past 7 years to communities and families across the central coast.  The Affordable Care Act meant Sarah, from Lompoc, could open her small business and afford insurance coverage for her two children.  It meant that Kathleen, in San Luis Obispo, who was diagnosed with ovarian and breast cancer, that her $500,000 medical bill was covered by her healthcare plan.  It meant that Adrienne, from Buellton, now could afford to pay for her husband's nursing facility, as his debilitating disease prevents her from being able to physically care for him.  Repealing legislation that has improved the quality of life not only for Sarah, Kathleen, and Adrienne, but for the over 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, would be callous, cruel, and irresponsible.  Instead of taking away health care from 24 million Americans, let's work together to create a more equitable, affordable, and accessible healthcare system for all.                              {time}  1215  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2393.txt,2310,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,24.0,March

We have had hearings, we have had votes, we have had a lot of conversations about it, and at last we are going to get a chance to vote on the ratification. So I come to the floor to speak in support of this resolution of ratification regarding the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of  I have been a strong supporter of Montenegro's bid to join It will enhance our security, it will strengthen the alliance, and it will send a strong message of resolve to Russia as it invades its neighbors and seeks to upend the international order. Montenegro's inclusion in NATO will have positive repercussions across the continent and will send an important message of hope to aspirant countries.  Last week, I met with Montenegro's Foreign Minister, and he described Russia's persistent efforts to weaken support for NATO membership in Last October, Russia interfered in the Montenegrin elections.[[Page S1992]]There was a plot to assassinate the former Prime Minister of Montenegro and take over the Montenegrin The suspects in that case scurried back to Moscow, and the Russian authorities refused to turn them over to the Montenegrins or even make them available for questioning in To this day, Russian-supported NGOs and media propaganda continue to rail against Montenegro's NATO membership.  Russia does not get a veto over decisions of the alliance. We need to send a strong message of resolve. This is not an isolated circumstance with We have seen how they interfered in our elections. We have seen what they are doing in Europe today.  We see all these different activities by Russia, and we have to protect ourselves. One way we protect ourselves is by making our own decisions as to who should be admitted into Another is that we should have an independent commission take a look at what Russia was doing in their interference with our elections and what they are trying to do in trying to compromise our democratic system of government. I think the events that occurred in recent weeks of additional contacts that Russia made with members of the Trump administration just underscore the importance for that independent commission to take a look at what happened.  I stand here today in support of NATO enlargement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently voted by voice vote in support of this bid--unanimously, Democrats and This is not a partisan issue. We have had a request from the President to take up this issue. Nearly all NATO members have approved Montenegro's bid. We are among the last to ratify, and we must get the job done. Tonight, we can take a major step forward in that regard.  What is the case for Montenegro's membership? Admission of Montenegro would mark another important step forward, fully integrating the Balkans into international institutions that have helped to contribute to peace and stability over the years in Croatia and Albania joined the alliance in 2009 and have been valuable contributors to accomplishing NATO's objectives since then. I hope that Montenegro's admission will help them motivate the reforms necessary for other Balkan countries to join.  Montenegro has made outsized contributions to NATO missions, despite not being a full member. I understand that in Afghanistan, Montenegro has rotated 20 percent of its armed forces through the ISAF and the resolute support missions. Twenty percent of their force--that is a substantial contribution. It also contributed to the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo and other NATO missions.  No country outside the alliance gets a veto over who gets to join, especially So we must send a strong signal.

721,topic-id,1979,"Mr.President, today I wish to join the American people in celebrating Women's History I would like to begin that celebration by paying homage to several women whose ingenuity and inventions have shaped modern society, but who, like innumerable women throughout history, have not received the credit or recognition they are due.  Katherine Blodgett is a good place to start. In 1935, she invented the first transparent glass that eliminated distortion and glare. Before her, glass contained small bubbles and inclusions that was suitable for windows, but little else. Her method of producing and cutting glass revolutionized the material and is the reason we have camera lenses, microscopes, and eyeglasses today. Without her pioneering work, our ability to see and our ability to look into the universe would be degraded.  In 1942, the actress Hedy Lamarr and a partner were granted a U.patent for a secret communication system that involved manipulating radio frequencies to form an unbreakable code to prevent classified messages from being intercepted. The significance of her invention was not fully realized until the 1960s, when it was used by naval ships during the Cuban Missile We were able to navigate that perilous nuclear threat successfully in part because of her self-taught inventiveness and skill. Lamarr's coded communications system has been used by numerous military agencies since.  Just 2 years later, in 1944, Grace Hopper made her own kind of history, becoming what many consider to be one of the world's first computer scientists. She invented the compiler that translated written language into computer code and coined the terms ``bug'' and ``debugging.'' Fifteen years later, she led the team that developed COBOL, one of the very first programming languages.  More recently, in 1965, Stephanie Kwolek invented We know Kevlar best as the material used to manufacture bulletproof vests, protecting our police officers and first responders in their greatest moments of crisis, but Kevlar is widely considered to be one of the strongest, most durable materials ever invented and has become a critical component in the manufacturing of airplanes, boats, cars, and bridge cables.  I pause to honor these great inventors and scientists because their names should be familiar, but they aren't. As long as toxic, gender-role stereotypes persist, these women serve as important examples that such stereotypes are hollow and wrong. Women have been serving on the frontlines of war, science, and invention since long before men ``allowed'' them.[[Page S2045]]  These women and others are part of our untold history. You will rarely hear them discussed in American classrooms, and you will seldom find their stories printed in textbooks. Most people wouldn't even recognize their names; yet our lives and fortunes have been shaped by them. Every day, men go to work protected by Kevlar vests, live their daily lives with the benefit of eyeglasses, or boot up their laptop computer using the devices and tools women gave them. That is both the majesty and tragedy of women's history: it is inextricable and powerful and entirely undervalued.  This Women's History Month should not pass without each and every one of us at the very least taking the time to acknowledge and appreciate the women of history who helped to invent modern society, who fought alongside men in every war, who gave us more complete rights and equality, who endured the habitual and everyday scorn of sexism--and who did so generation after generation without accolade or recognition.  Perhaps the best way to honor the past is to secure the future. The denizens of women's history didn't endure systemic misogyny or work so hard to change our world so that we would peer backward and applaud. They did so with the hope we would look forward and make progress.  We still have a long way to go, but we have made progress. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, being a woman is no longer considered a ``preexisting condition'' that warrants higher premiums and deductibles. Also thanks to the Affordable Care Act, preventative services for women--like mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and prenatal care--are covered by insurance companies. Today more than 48 million American women take advantage of that.  Thanks to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, women have extended protection in cases of wage discrimination. The Lilly Ledbetter Act finally recognized that, when pay discrimination occurs, it is not a single event, but a chronic and repeated offense that inflicts ongoing damage with each and every substandard paycheck. This simple and commonsense recognition has allowed women to seek justice against the kind of economic disenfranchisement that has plagued generations.  Progress, however, does not have its own autopilot button. We must be its stewards and its champions. We must be its agents. We must protect it actively, each and every day, or else we will be complicit in its loss.  I am talking about women's reproductive rights. A woman's right to make her own decisions is under threat today. Her body is her body. It is not ours, and it certainly is not the government's. Roe v. Wade decided that in 1973, yet 44 years later, the Federal Government is run by a party that uses every tool at its disposal to chip away at reproductive rights. Whether it is State policies to limit the types of buildings abortions can be performed in or the threat to defund Planned Parenthood, women's rights are under attack.  Let's be clear that Federal funding for abortion services is already banned under the Hyde Today's witch hunt against Planned Parenthood is not substantive in nature; it is a thinly-veiled attempt to prolong a culture war with the hope of assuaging far-right voters. Women's reproductive rights deserve more than to be treated as a political punchline. Reproductive rights were hard-won by centuries of activism and pain, and we--all Members of this Chamber--must vow this month and every month to honor that with our votes and with our voices. We must vow not to let women's reproductive rights be diminished on our watch.  It is 2017, and still, women are expected to be everything simultaneously, all while they are refused the tools and the freedom to balance such difficult demands. It is 2017, and still, families--mothers most of all--are too often forced to choose between parenthood and economic security, between recovering from childbirth and their career. No woman, no matter what her line of work or Zip Code may be, should be forced to make such an impossible decision. It is our job to pass legislation to ensure no woman has to.  Even with the Lilly Ledbetter legislation, women today are paid, on average, just 77 cents for every dollar men receive for performing the same work. That gap is even worse for women of color: African-American women only earn 64 cents to the dollar, while Latina women earn only 55 cents. That is a problem begging to be solved by That is a problem for all of us. Women are powerful economic engines in this country, and if we continue to stand idly by while their work is underpaid and undervalued, we will all suffer. We will all have to explain to our daughters and granddaughters why we didn't fight harder for them.  Critically, there is also the issue of violence against women. It is a moral outrage that women experience about 4.8 million intimate partner related physical and sexual assaults every single year. When women stand up and tell us the stories behind this number, we must sit down and listen. We must stop speaking over them with advice on how to protect themselves or avoid certain social situations. They shouldn't have to. It is insulting to presume they require lectures on personal safety, but that men don't require lectures on consent. This problem demands a cultural shift, and we must be its purveyors.  There is the issue of college affordability. A related issue is access to and participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, programs and--of equal importance--encouragement to join them. Women need to be better represented in positions of power.  These and other issues are what is at stake. These and other issues are why we recognize Women's History Month: to remind ourselves and each other that women helped build this Nation and this world. We need to remind ourselves that women are therefore entitled to equal representation in it and equal access to its opportunities. We need to remind ourselves that women deserve equal respect and equal protection under the law and that women's rights are human rights. We all prosper when we fight to protect them.  Toward these ends, I have led the charge in Congress to ratify the Equal Rights Many Americans would be shocked to learn that the Constitution still lacks a provision ensuring gender equality. That is wrong, but it is fixable. I have introduced S.5, legislation to remove the deadline for States to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would pave the way for its formal adoption. Nevada recently passed the Equal Rights Amendment, leaving us just two States shy of success.  The Equal Rights Amendment is only slightly longer than two tweets, but its ratification would finally give women full and equal protection under the It reads as follows:       Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be      denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on      account of sex.       Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by      appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.       Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after      the date of ratification.  It is that simple, and it is both necessary and past time to adopt it.  When Congress passed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States, 38 States, within 7 years. The original deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint resolution enacted by Ultimately, 35 States ratified the ERA by the time the revised deadline expired, leaving advocates a little short.  Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for ratification of constitutional amendments. In fact, in 1992, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting immediate congressional pay raises was ratified after 203 years. The Senate could pass my legislation removing the 10-year deadline right now. I strongly encourage the majority leader to bring S.5 up for a vote as soon as possible. American women deserve to know that their most fundamental rights are explicitly protected by our nation's most venerated document.  I have often said that how a nation treats its women is a good barometer of that nation's potential for success as a whole. I hold the United States of America to that standard. Every day, I weigh the successes and failures we have had along the path toward fair treatment and gender equality, and I assess ways Congress can facilitate more successes. Every day, I reevaluate how best to fight for the Equal Rights Amendment, how best to protect reproductive rights, how best to fight for[[Page S2046]]paid family leave and affordable higher education and greater representation in this very  I invite every Senator to do the same, both because those are the right battles and because fighting them protects gender equality progress that has been so hard-won by the women of this We must not allow those victories to be reversed. We must keep progressing.  This Women's History Month, I am reminded of what the poet G.Anderson once said: ``Feminism is not about making women strong. Women are already strong. It's about changing the way the world perceives that strength.'' Let us remember it is precisely that strength that has propelled our world forward. It is precisely that strength that serves as the foundation of so many of this country's successes, and it is precisely that strength we must remember and meet with our own, when women's rights are under siege.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2044-2.txt,,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,March

952,topic-id,1108,"Mr.President, I take to the floor to urge my colleagues to vote against two of the resolutions that are on the floor, H.66 and H.67--both under the Congressional Review Act--which would not allow two regulations under the Obama administration to go forward that would allow for increased retirement security for American workers and families.  Throughout my time in office, I have fought hard for measures that increase the retirement security for American workers and families. One of the most prominent examples is the private retirement improvements that I championed with my friend Senator Portman when we were both in the House of  More recently, Senator Portman and I have joined together to support other changes to our pension laws that enhance retirement security. For instance, the Cardin-Portman Church[[Page S2084]]Plan Clarification Act, which became law in 2015, clarified the application of certain tax laws and regulations to the unique structures of church pension plans. The Cardin-Portman Retirement Security Preservation Act, which was reported out of the Finance Committee unanimously last September, amends nondiscrimination regulations to protect older workers in pension plans that have been closed or frozen. I hope the bill will be taken up again in this  I mention these efforts over the years with Senator Portman because I think they show two things: First, they show that ensuring all Americans can retire with dignity is an ongoing effort. We need to work continually with workers, retirees, and other stakeholders to make sure retirement security is achievable, especially as our economy changes. Second, they show that this ongoing work has been and hopefully will continue to be strongly bipartisan. That is why I need to speak in opposition to H.66 and H.67. These resolutions are an unnecessary step backward in our ongoing retirement security work.  As my colleagues are aware, H.66 and H.67 eliminate the ERISA safe harbor that was created by the Department of Labor for IRA plans that are administered by State and local governments. We are considering the local government resolution today, but I want to stress the importance of both types of plans.  The provisions of this safe harbor are very similar to an existing safe harbor that is already in ERISA that allows employers to establish payroll deductions to So long as the State- and municipal-run plans meet the requirements of the safe harbor, the businesses--usually small businesses--that offer State-run retirement plans to their workers will not inadvertently be subject to liability under Federal law.  The Department of Labor rules were meant to provide legal certainty to the increasing number of States that have decided, in the absence of any action by the Congress, to address the retirement coverage gap in their communities. Maryland is one of those Our State is active. Last year, Republican Governor Larry Hogan signed legislation creating a Maryland-run automatic IRA program. The legislation was backed by the Democratic leaders in the general assembly. In fact, it passed unanimously out of our  The reason for this bipartisanship was, in part, in recognition of the stakes. At the time the law went into effect, which was last July, an estimated 1 million Marylanders worked for businesses that did not offer retirement savings plans. Without the rule, the businesses that choose to use the Maryland-run option to provide retirement plans for their workers may face legal liability. At the very least, the repeal of the safe harbor will slow the entire implementation process.  I understand that my colleagues who oppose the Department of Labor rule want to be sure that strong ERISA protections apply to retirees; however, under current law, most IRAs do not have ERISA protection. For these IRAs, the only chance for any kind of consumer protection is for States to do it. H.66 and H.67 are seeking to undo that.  I am also confused by claims that the adoption of these resolutions would necessarily lead to the complete ERISA preemption of State programs. The Department of Labor does not take that position. To claim that these resolutions alone would have such a broad effect on the interaction of ERISA with State law is troubling, to say the least.  Let me be clear. I would prefer Federal action in this space. Retirement security is one of a seemingly dwindling number of bipartisan issues we can tackle in Congress, and the concerns raised by many of the stakeholders I have worked with in the past on retirement reform are understandable. I am concerned that a lack of Federal action will lead to a State-level patchwork that will be hard for employers and more mobile workers to navigate. I would much rather build on the efforts of the States to create a uniform Federal system under which employers would adopt high-quality, well-managed plans. I am also concerned that providing a State-run option could diminish robust competition with the private sector.  The point of these State-run programs is to decrease our coverage gap. However, we must not also create a race to the bottom whereby employers opt for a one-size-fits-all minimum and do not consider other plans that may be better tailored to their workforces. This is not, in my view, the case in  The answer to these problems is not H.66 or H.67; it is for Congress to continue its ongoing bipartisan work on retirement security, not to undermine what our States have chosen to do to help our mutual constituents. This is federalism the way federalism is supposed to work. The States adopt policies and hopefully give us some guidance as to how we can develop uniform national policies.  I am, frankly, surprised that my Republican colleagues have chosen to take up these resolutions. It is hard to see what the disapproval of the Department of Labor rules achieves other than notching the repeal of another Obama-era rule, but at what cost?  To me, the resolutions take a fairly clear, anti-States'-rights stance, all to create potential liability for small employers who will take advantage of the new State laws. Essentially, supporting this resolution means sowing unnecessary legal confusion in an area in which States have already acted in a bipartisan way. We can do better. We can work together on this issue. Instead of focusing on haphazard repeal measures, I am confident that we can produce thoughtful, substantive, bipartisan solutions.  I urge my colleagues to oppose these resolutions. As I have in the past, I stand ready to work with them to ensure all Americans can save with dignity for their financially secure retirement.

1170,topic-id,762,"Madam President, I rise to express my strong opposition to H.43, a resolution of disapproval with respect to the title X regulation--a resolution which effectively endorses discriminatory practices toward family planning and safety net providers.  Title X is the Nation's only Federal grant program that is dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related[[Page S2127]]preventive health services. Last year, title X funding made it possible for nearly 4,000 health centers to provide basic primary and preventive healthcare services to over 4 million low-income women and their families. I am talking about critical services, such as Pap tests, cervical cancer screenings, contraception, breast exams, and HIV testing.  In Maryland, there are 55 title X funded health centers that span the These include federally qualified health centers, local health departments, Planned Parenthood clinics, and school-based health centers. In fiscal year 2015, Maryland received over $3.8 million in title X funding and provided health services to over 64,000 patients. These are low-income, underinsured, and uninsured individuals who would otherwise lack access to such basic healthcare.  As many of my colleagues know, Planned Parenthood, a high-quality health provider, has been under constant attack by the Republicans, who want to eliminate the organization's Federal funding. Just last week, the Republicans' Affordable Care Act repeal-and-replace bill threatened to defund Planned Parenthood, which is a trusted healthcare provider, by eliminating clinics' Medicaid reimbursements. This week, Republicans want to roll back protections that were put in place for family planning clinics and allow for discrimination against our Nation's family planning providers.  What I find even more disappointing is that this is a major policy shift for our Nation, and we are using a procedure known as the Congressional Review Act to make that decision. Yet those who support this are not even taking to the floor to defend it. This is outrageous that one would use a procedure to repeal this type of funding and not even be on the floor to defend those actions.  In December of 2016, the Obama administration finalized the regulation before us today to protect family planning providers from such discrimination. The regulation was intended to protect access to care in States that have issued their own regulations and legislation that block family planning providers from receiving title X funds. By overriding this regulation, Republicans will empower States to pick and choose who provides these services, but it will be based on arbitrary criteria that will have nothing to do with the quality of services the patients will receive. Republicans are actively condoning discrimination against providers, which will, ultimately, deny women and their families access to family planning and preventive health services.  It is not just Democrats who are concerned. Multiple healthcare providers have come out against this resolution because discrimination against any healthcare provider is wrong. Let me name just a few of the groups that oppose this action: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and They are all alarmed because they know low-income, underinsured, and uninsured patients will be unable to access needed health services if it passes.  In Maryland, for example, 84 percent of the 64,000-plus patients served with title X funds have incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty line. That means that they earn $11,770 a year or less--under $12,000 a year. How do you expect these families to be able to get their healthcare needs met if this resolution of disapproval is passed? Ninety-four percent of title X patients in Maryland earn less than $29,425 a year. Overturning this regulation will hurt our most vulnerable communities.  Let's be clear about this. This is not about abortion. There is no Federal funding for abortion. This is about low-income men and women not having access to pregnancy testing, contraceptive services, pelvic exams, high blood pressure and diabetes screenings, STD and HIV/AIDS screenings, infertility services, and health education. It is a war on the poor, and it is a war on access to preventive healthcare.  The American people deserve better from their elected officials. I am committed to fighting these reckless attempts to repeal a reasonable regulation that has been promulgated to prevent discriminatory practices that will harm thousands of low-income women and their families in Maryland and across our  I urge my colleagues to reject this procedural resolution, which will allow discrimination and deny adequate care to low-income families.

1231,topic-id,1934,"Mr.President, I rise today to lend my voice in support of perhaps one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to the U.Supreme I am referring, of course, to Chief Judge Merrick  Over 1 year ago, on March 16, 2016, a President who was twice elected by significant margins in both the popular vote and the electoral college nominated Judge Garland to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin President Obama upheld his constitutional duty by submitting a name to the Senate to fill this vacancy.  By submitting the name of Merrick Garland, he gave the Senate a man who has spent his career working to build consensus and to find principled compromises. His impeccable credentials speak for themselves: Harvard undergrad, top of his class; Harvard Law, top of his class; law clerk to Judge Friendly on the Second Circuit and Justice Brennan on the Supreme He served in the Justice Department after a time in private practice.  When tragedy befell Oklahoma City in April of 1995, Merrick Garland led the investigation that brought justice to the perpetrators of that unthinkable act of terrorism. Judge Gorsuch called this work ``The most important thing I have ever done in my life.''  His career was far from over at that point. In 1997, Republicans and Democrats joined together to confirm Judge Garland to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is often called the ``second highest court in the land.''  Here is what Senator Orrin Hatch, former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and currently the President pro tempore of the Senate, said of him at the time:       Merrick Garland is highly qualified to sit on the DC      His intelligence and his scholarship cannot be      questioned. . . . His legal experience is equally impressive.      . . . Accordingly, I believe Mr.Garland is a fine nominee. I      know him personally, I know of his integrity, I know of his      legal ability, I know of his honesty, I know of his acumen,      and he belongs on the court.  Those are not my words. Those are the words of Senator Orrin Hatch, a good friend and colleague.  Over the past two decades on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Garland established a reputation as a thoughtful judge, a fair judge, a man of high integrity, a judicial moderate, and a consensus builder in a day and age when we need consensus builders--not here but on the Supreme Court and other courts.  Even those who may disagree with him tend to find themselves thinking a little harder about their own views after hearing his.  During his 2005 confirmation hearing to serve as Chief Justice, John Roberts, who served with Judge Garland on the DC Circuit, stated these words: ``Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.''  Thank you, Chief Justice  In 2013, Judge Garland was promoted to chief judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land--the chief judge, presiding over that court.  When President Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court over 1 year ago, Judge Garland brought with him more Federal judicial experience than any nominee in the history of the United  When I met with Judge Garland last year, I got to know him beyond just his resume. Ironically, he had actually performed the marriage ceremony for my former chief of staff and his bride several years ago.  I was struck by Judge Garland's humility and by his personal character, his personal traits. Even as a nominee for the Supreme Court, he continued to serve his community as a mentor to elementary school students right here in Washington, Imagine that. A chief judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals taking time every week to mentor some kid who needs another good role model in his or her life. That is something that Judge Garland has done for about two decades.  Over 1 year later, as I stand here today, a seat on the Supreme Court--what should be, in my view, Judge Garland's seat--remains vacant. Our Republican colleagues, in an unprecedented display of what I think is obstructionism and partisanship, denied Judge Garland a hearing and a vote. Many of our Republican colleagues refused to even meet with him. He was denied both a hearing in the Judiciary Committee and a cloture vote in the full  Well, since the Senate Judiciary Committee began holding public hearings on Supreme Court nominees 101 years ago, in 1916, no Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote.  I will say that again. No Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote--well, until Judge  According to the highly respected website, SCOTUSblog, we read these words:       The historical record does not reveal any instances since      at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the      Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential      election year because of the impending election.  That is right off the blog.[[Page S2144]]  Judge Garland was denied a hearing and a vote. In fact, during the 1988 Presidential election year, Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate 97 to 0--not 51 to 49, not 60 to 40, but 97 to 0. But Judge Garland was denied a hearing and a vote.  Our Constitution, the one that every Member of this great deliberative body has sworn an oath to uphold, standing right over there, requires the Senate to provide its advice and consent to Supreme Court nominees.  Over the years, there have been a lot of questions as to what advice and consent entails. Judge Garland was denied a hearing and a vote. A good man--I think an extraordinary man--was treated badly, as was our  I believe the unprecedented obstruction our Republican colleagues mounted last year against Judge Garland was a shameful chapter for the U.Mr.Garland, a consensus builder, one of the most qualified judges in our country, waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that ultimately never came. I am still deeply troubled by those 293 wasted days, and I am still deeply troubled by the way Judge Garland was treated. I believe Judge Garland still deserves a hearing and still deserves a vote.  While I do not believe that two wrongs make a right, I believe this may be our only opportunity to right a wrong and erase the enormous black mark that the Senate's failure to consider Judge Garland leaves on this chapter of American history. I think it is unacceptable to put partisan politics over fidelity to our U.Confirming anyone for this vacancy other than Judge Garland would be a stamp of approval for playing politics with Supreme Court nominees.  From where I sit, upholding our oath to protect the Constitution means finding agreement on moving Judge Garland's nomination forward at the same time as that of Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee. When President Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes last year and narrowly won the electoral college, he promised to be a President for all I think a fair question is, Has he upheld that promise?  Well, let's decide--an unconstitutional Muslim ban, an unnecessary and overpriced wall on the southern border, a failed healthcare bill that would have provided less coverage for more money, a rollback of environmental protections for all of us who don't want to drink dirty water and don't want to breathe dirty air. If you ask me, the President has broken the promise to be a President for all Now I realize that others may differ and disagree, but his nomination of Judge Gorsuch represents what I believe is another broken promise.  I have heard from middle-class folks, from workers up and down my State, from special education teachers, from immigrant communities, from women who depend on access to healthcare, and my guess is my colleagues have as well. Many of them fear that Judge Gorsuch is not on their side. Despite his impressive resume, I share those same concerns.  At this time, I believe it is appropriate to hit the pause button until an agreement can be reached that provides justice for Judge Garland while restoring credibility to the U.I believe that is only bolstered by the cloud that lingers over President Trump's campaign.  As FBI Director Comey testified last week, there is an ongoing investigation to determine the links between Russia and the Trump campaign and whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. It has also been widely reported in the media that officials from the upper echelon of the Trump campaign have close ties to Vladimir Putin's interests in weakening democratic governments throughout the There are many Americans who believe that Judge Gorsuch has been nominated for a stolen Supreme Court seat. There are also a number of Americans who believe that he has been nominated by a man whose campaign may have coordinated with foreign adversaries on stealing a Presidential election.  Let me be clear. At the moment, no evidence has been made public to indicate that this is the case, but there are few nominations that any President will make that will have more of an impact on our Constitution and on the lives of everyday Americans than the U.Supreme To hastily move forward with Judge Gorsuch, who is 49 years old and can serve on the Supreme Court well into the middle of this century, without first getting to the bottom of the suspicious and irregular actions of the Trump campaign officials, I believe, would be a mistake.  The American people need to know that the President's campaign was above reproach before we decide whether Judge Gorsuch merits approval for a lifetime appointment.  I will close my remarks by offering a word of caution to my colleagues. We have maintained and preserved a 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees to prevent Democrats and Republicans from choosing political expediency over bipartisan consensus. If Judge Gorsuch fails to obtain 60 votes on the cloture vote next week, I think it could signal one of three things. First, that Judge Gorsuch's views are outside the judicial mainstream; second, that we still have an opportunity to rectify the injustice done to Judge Garland and to our Constitution; or third, that we still do not know the nature of the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia--a country whose leadership has ordered an attack on our election and our democracy, as well as a whole lot of other countries around the world.  If Judge Gorsuch fails to achieve 60 votes on the first try or the next try, it does not mean that his nomination will not move forward at some point in the future. It means we have hit the pause button. It may very well be that while we pause, another vacancy on the Court could emerge. Who knows when another vacancy might occur? But if you ask me, another vacancy might present the Senate with an opportunity to right what I believe is a historic wrong, and we should see if the other objections that have been raised about Judge Gorsuch could be addressed before we change the rules of the Senate in favor of the party in power.  In closing, I will say again that Judge Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never came. Judge Gorsuch waited 48 days for a hearing, and we will be voting on his nomination next week. Talk about a rush to judgment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young). The Senator's time has expired.

966,topic-id,1073,"Mr.President, I rise to express my grave concern about Russian aggression and interference in our political system. My concerns have been compounded over the last several weeks by the response to these allegations by President Trump and his administration.  First, let's step back for a moment. We know that the Russian Federation is an adversary of the United That is without question. Vladimir Putin is what I would like to call a 24-hour bad guy. There are a lot of other ways to express it, but that is one way. There is not a moment of the day when he isn't using his power to undermine our Nation's interests and the interests of freedom and democracy across the globe.  We know that the Russian regime kills journalists, jails and silences their critics, and commits war crimes in places like Syria and Russia meddles in elections throughout the Western world.  Mr.Putin has a warped world view. His view is that the freedom and democratic rights of tens of millions of people in Europe should be subject to the interests of a few in the Kremlin because those countries lie within Russia's supposed sphere of influence.  The work done by our intelligence agencies indicates that Russia meddled in our election with the intent of aiding President We know that now. In January, our intelligence agencies concluded:       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential      election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in      the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and      harm her electability and potential presidency. We further      assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear      preference for President-elect  That is what our intelligence agencies tell us, and I am quoting verbatim from that basic finding.  President Trump's refusal to accept the assessment of our intelligence agencies was deeply concerning--and that is an understatement. My concerns were compounded by the fact that President Trump ran on the most pro-Russian platform in modern history. Since President Trump has taken[[Page S2093]]office, he has harshly criticized our allies, from Australia to Mexico, yet when it comes to Russia's provocations and war crimes, President Trump is silent.  This deference that President Trump shows to Mr.Putin is troubling and, when combined with Russia's meddling in our election, it raises profound questions that need answers. That is why I strongly support the establishment of an independent commission to investigate Russia's interference in our political system, and I believe that the Justice Department must appoint a special counsel to investigate this matter as well.  What the American people need to know, once and for all, is at least three things: 1, what specific actions Russia took to aid President Trump during the election; 2, whether U.persons had knowledge of or were involved in these actions; and, finally, 3, whether President Trump has financial entanglements with Russians associated with the Putin regime.  You could probably add other questions, but I think they are the three basic questions we have to answer.  So this is a grave problem with substantial national security implications. My constituents agree, as I am sure is the case in every other Just since January 1, more than 80,000 Pennsylvanians have written to my office about That is 80,000 These are thoughtful letters from Pennsylvanians who are so concerned about this issue that they took the time to write.

If the warnings from the U.intelligence community and the pleas from 80,000-plus Pennsylvanians aren't enough, then let's look at the numerous credible reports of contact between Russian officials and the Trump team. This body of reporting grows every day.  On January 18, McClatchy reported that ``The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said.''  On January 19, the Washington Post reported, ``U.counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, officials said.''  Then again on January 19, the New York Times reported, ``American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.''  We know that Mr.Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, previously worked for the Russian-backed President of Ukraine, Victor According to an August 2016 report by the New York Times, ``Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr.Manafort from Mr.Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine's newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau.''  In February 2017, when confronted by the New York Times about reports that Trump associates may have been in contact with Russian officials during the election, Mr.Manafort said, ``It's not like these people wear badges that say, `I'm a Russian intelligence officer.' ''  Then there is the case of a former member President Trump's foreign policy advisory committee, Carter In September of 2016, Yahoo's Michael Isikoff reported, ``U.intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials--including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.''

Kathy was an Indian gentleman who went to Johannesburg with his family as a young man and found that, at age 8, he had to move there because there were no Indian schools in South He became, at a very early age, an activist for social reform and against apartheid, first for Indian rights and then against apartheid and for South African rights.  He was arrested, along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Mbeki, Goldberg, and other leaders of the ANC, tried in the famous Rivonia trial in 1963, and convicted as they all were. He spent 18 years in prison on Robben Island, with Nelson Mandela and others, and 8 additional years in prison. But when released from prison, he didn't see bitterness, he saw only peace and a period of commitment to resolving race relations in South  He befriended the people who had been his guards and who had subjected him to minority rights.

603,topic-id,557,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to join you today in this 1-hour session.  I am the co-chair of the Medical Research As the co-chair, I am most aware of the need for research and how much it has helped our country and how much it has helped many cities and universities in their efforts to save us.  For a long time, I have realized that my enemy--and I am not suggesting to anybody, or I don't want anybody to get the wrong impression that I don't think that we need a military, and a strong military, but I have known that the odds of me dying from something that happens initiated by North Korea or Iran or ISIS is about nil. But I also know that the odds of my dying from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer is likely. So my enemy is disease.  And who is working to protect me and be my defense department? The National Institutes of That is my defense department. That is all of America's defense department, for we all have, as an enemy, disease. Cures and treatments will be found through grants and research coordinated through the National Institutes of  Francis Collins, the genius who is the Director of the NIH, is really our secretary of defense because he is fighting to find cures and treatments not just for us, but more so for the next generation and the next generation.  So it is a perfect situation for us to act to protect our constituents against their most serious enemy, and that is disease, and to protect them no matter how we fund it. For the deficit hawks who might suggest that some of the expenses be paid for by future generations, that is who is going to get the treatments and the cures, and people not even born yet.  In 1954, my father was a pediatrician, and he gave the Salk vaccine to second grade children for polio. He didn't give it to me in the fall of 1954 or the spring of 1954 because that wasn't his charge; it was to give it to second graders in a test of the Salk vaccine.  I came down with polio in September of 1954. And but for medical research not being a year earlier when the Salk vaccine became available to everyone in the spring of 1955, I would not have had polio.  It affected me as a young person. I spent 3 months in a hospital, lots of time with physical therapists, had surgeries, and today wear a brace because, without it, I wouldn't be standing here.  My future, I am not sure what it will be, but it would have been a lot better if we had the Salk vaccine a year earlier. For every cure and treatment that comes a little later and a little later are that many more people that will suffer from it.  So this nearly $6 billion cut is going to affect people's lives in a meaningful way. For that reason, I am proud to join Mr.Garamendi and my other colleagues here to oppose this $6 billion cut and also to advocate for increases in funding to the National Institutes of Health, our real defense department fighting for all Americans against the number one enemy we all have, which is catastrophic illnesses and diseases.

32,topic-id,4716,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarkable leadership in this important debate.  Seven years ago, I was on this floor and I heard that, if you liked your plan, you could keep it. I heard, if you liked your doctor, you could keep that doctor. And I heard that healthcare costs were going to drop by $2,500 per family. None of it was true.  I sit here now and look at my State, and I know what is happening next year. The rates on the ObamaCare exchanges are going up by 69 percent. We are down to a single provider. That is what 7 years ago brought us.  Today we have a chance to do something different, and everybody from my State will do something different. They will vote for a plan that actually does what it says it is going to do. Number one, they will be able to actually have plans that are designed by Oklahomans, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.They will be able to have a tax credit, if they are not already insured under Medicaid or Medicare or from their employer. They will be able to have an individual tax credit to purchase a plan that they design, that they like. They will be free of the mandates of ObamaCare, free to make their own decisions, free of the mandates that require them to buy insurance products that they simply don't need.  I have got a lot of people in my district that are in their fifties and sixties. Some of them might like to have children again, but they are not likely to have children again, and they mostly don't want maternity care.  So it is a pretty simple choice for us. It is a choice to be free and make our own decisions. It is a choice to design our own plans. It is a choice to have Federal assistance where we need it, but to be used under our direction. It is an easy choice.  I urge the passage of this rule, and I urge the passage of the underlying legislation.                              {time}  1000  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from NETWORK, the lobby for Catholic Social Justice; a letter from the National Alliance on Mental Illness; a letter from the Mental Health Liaison Group; and an article in the New York Times entitled ``Late GOP Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy but Not Chemotherapy.''       Dear Representative: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social      Justice urges you to vote NO on the American Health Care Act      (AHCA). This legislation fails to protect access to quality,      affordable healthcare for vulnerable communities. It would      widen the gaps in our society by making massive cuts to      Medicaid, giving large tax breaks to the very wealthiest      families and corporations, and threatening the health      security of American families.       Our faith teaches that access to healthcare is an essential      human right that is necessary to protect the life and dignity      of every person. The bill would drastically increase the      number of people without health insurance--and I know that      behind those numbers are millions of stories of families      facing medical bankruptcy, forgoing treatment, and losing      loved ones who could have been saved by preventative care.       The AHCA cuts Medicaid spending--an essential source of      care for millions of children, seniors, people with      disabilities, and people experiencing poverty in our nation--     and a per-capita cap would force states to ration care. The      legislation would also increase costs for older and sicker      patients and burden low- and moderate-income families with      much higher premiums by cutting $312 billion of financial      assistance for people purchasing health insurance on the      individual market. This is far from the Gospel mandate to      care for our most vulnerable sisters and brothers.       For any replacement to the ACA to be sufficient, it must      meet these 10 conditions--a Ten Commandments of Healthcare if      you will--and the AHCA breaks nine of 10 commandments:[[Page H2383]]         1. Thou shalt provide affordable insurance and the same      benefits to all currently covered under the Affordable Care      AHCA fails.       2. Thou shalt continue to allow children under the age of      26 to be covered by their parents' insurance.       3. Thou shalt ensure that insurance premiums and cost      sharing are truly affordable to all. AHCA fails.       4. Thou shalt expand Medicaid to better serve vulnerable      people in our nation.

Thou shalt create effective mechanisms of accountability      for insurance companies and not allow them to have annual or      lifetime caps on expenditures. AHCA partial fail.       7. Thou shalt not allow insurance companies to discriminate      against those with pre-existing conditions. AHCA partial      fail.       8. Thou shalt not allow insurance companies to discriminate      against women, the elderly, and people in poverty. AHCA      fails.       9. Thou shalt provide adequate assistance for people      enrolling and using their health coverage. AHCA fails.       10. Thou shalt continue to ensure reasonable revenue is in      the federal budget to pay for life-sustaining healthcare for      all. AHCA fails.       At its heart, this bill has lost sight of community and the      common good. Its biggest problem is that it lacks the      awareness that it is community which makes healthcare      effective. Healthcare is not just about the individual--it is      a communal good. The hyper individualism evident in the AHCA      is sucking the life out of our nation. Just focusing on one's      individual self is contrary to our Catholic faith and      contrary to our We will track the vote and      score it in our 2017 voting record.

Re The American Health Care     Greg Walden,     Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: NAMI is      the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization      dedicated to building better lives for the millions of      Americans affected by mental illness. On behalf of our      nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, I am writing to express      our views on the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which seeks      to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).       The mental health crisis in our nation is well documented.      Half of all Americans with mental illness go without      treatment. Last year, Congress passed significant bipartisan      legislation to address the crisis in our nation's mental      health system. However, addressing the mental health needs in      our country relies on a foundation of affordable, quality      health coverage with fair and equal coverage of mental health      and substance use conditions. Thus, the importance of      Medicaid and insurance safeguards for individuals living with      mental illness cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, the      proposed reforms in the AHCA threaten to undermine the      historic progress being made to improve mental health and      substance use care.          Restructuring Medicaid Threatens Mental Health Care       Medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health and      substance use services in the United Medicaid is also      the largest funding source for the country's public mental      health system. One in five of Medicaid's nearly 70 million      beneficiaries have a mental health or substance use disorder      diagnosis.       NAMI is deeply concerned with proposed provisions to      convert Medicaid financing into a per capita cap model. This      would limit federal funding to a lump sum for all enrollees      and, instead of providing more flexibility, would shift      financial risk for health care costs--including unexpected      costs, such as promising new innovations in treatment--to      states. Current estimates are that the per capita cap      provisions would shift an alarming $370 billion in Medicaid      costs to states over the next ten years. In the face of      budget shortfalls, states will be forced to cut people from      coverage, reduce health benefits and access to care, and/or      reduce already low provider payments, escalating our nation's      healthcare workforce crisis.       The AHCA would set per capita caps for Medicaid at current      funding levels, adjusted for medical inflation. Funding for      mental health and substance use services is already      inadequate in Medicaid programs and, under this model, could      not be improved without cutting other health care. Further,      the deep reductions in federal Medicaid funding would mean      that people with mental illness will face even more desperate      circumstances when trying to access critical mental health      care.             Freezing Medicaid Expansion Puts Lives at Risk       Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion      lives with a mental health or substance use condition.      Medicaid expansion has proven to be a lifeline that helps      people with mental illness who typically fall through the      cracks. Medicaid expansion provides coverage to people with      mental health conditions who are too sick to navigate the      traditional Medicaid application process, who are just stable      enough not to qualify for disability (often because they are      coming out of a psychiatric hospital), or who have first      symptoms of a serious mental illness.       NAMI strongly urges the Committee to take further steps to      preserve enrollment in Medicaid expansion, rather than the      proposed end to new enrollment in 2020. Expanded eligibility      has brought mental health treatment and the hope of recovery      to millions affected by mental illness. It is helping keep      people healthier and productive in their communities.      Congress should not abandon this important means of improving      coverage for and access to critical mental health treatment.       NAMI also urges the Committee to reject provisions in the      AHCA that would lock enrollees out of Medicaid expansion      should they experience a lapse of coverage of more than one      month. This is a high price to pay for forgetting to pay a      premium while in the hospital or experiencing severe symptoms      of mental illness. Denying coverage only serves to further      de-stabilize lives with costly consequences for individuals,      families and communities.       Finally, NAMI is very concerned that the AHCA removes the      requirement for Medicaid expansion plans to cover essential      health benefits, including mental health and substance use      treatment. Congress' significant commitment to mental health      and substance use services in recent legislation should not      be jeopardized by making these vital services optional in      Our country can ill afford to weaken coverage at a      time when the need for mental health and substance use      treatment is so high.             Continuing Insurance Subsidies and Protections       To help Americans afford quality health insurance, NAMI      strongly urges the Committee to continue current levels of      federal support, tied to income, to purchase health care      coverage. Without assistance tied to income, more people with      mental illness will be unable to afford coverage for mental      health care. This threatens their overall health, resulting      in more costly and difficult-to-treat conditions and denying      people the chance to reach and maintain recovery and a stable      life in the community.       NAMI appreciates that the Committee included essential      insurance safeguards in the These safeguards include      protecting Americans from losing or being denied coverage      because of pre-existing health conditions. This also includes      continuing to allow young adults to remain on their parent's      health insurance plans to age 26 and banning annual and      lifetime caps for insurance coverage.       Cutting corners in health coverage will keep people from      getting the treatment they need and will push people with      mental illness into costly emergency rooms, hospitals and      jails. Making the investment early in affordable, quality      mental health care promotes recovery and reduces the high      long-term financial burden to taxpayers in avoidable      disability, criminal justice involvement and hospital care.       NAMI urges the Committee to maintain coverage and services      for people with mental illness by preserving financial help      based on income, removing the proposed per capita cap      financing model for Medicaid and protecting expanded Medicaid      eligibility. We appreciate the challenges in reforming      America's health coverage and look forward to working with      you to improve mental health coverage and care for children      and adults throughout our nation.           Sincerely,                                             Mary Giliberti, J.D.,     Chief Executive Officer,                                  ____                                  Mental Health Liaison Group,                                                   March 17, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     House Minority Leader,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Mental      Health Liaison Group (MHLG) wishes to express our serious      concerns about the provisions of the American Health Care Act      (AHCA) that would restructure the Medicaid program and end      the Medicaid expansion, as well as provisions of that      legislation that would significantly reduce the Federal      premium assistance that enrollees receive from the Federal      government to maintain continuous insurance coverage, and      impose a significant penalty for not maintaining continuous      coverage. We are also very concerned that the legislation      would eliminate required coverage for prevention and      treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders under      state Medicaid managed care and alternative benefit programs,      as Medicaid is the major source of Federal funding in every      state for mental health and substance use services.[[Page H2384]]       The MHLG is a coalition of dozens of national organizations      representing consumers, family members, mental health and      substance use treatment providers, state behavioral health      agencies, advocates, payers, and other stakeholders committed      to strengthening Americans' access to mental health and      substance use services and programs.       The elimination of Medicaid expansion under the AHCA would      leave without coverage the 1.3 million childless, non-     pregnant adults with serious mental illness who were able,      for the first time, to gain coverage under Medicaid      expansion. It would also leave uncovered the 2.8 million      childless, non-pregnant adults with substance use disorders      who also gained coverage under expansion for the first time.      These are populations that Congress promised and worked to      serve with the passage of 21st Century Cures and the      Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016,      respectively. And it is important to remember that untreated      mental health and substance use disorders intensify and serve      to increase the number of co-morbid medical conditions in      those populations, thereby multiplying total Medicaid program      costs.       Medicaid is the single largest payer for behavioral health      services in the United States, accounting for about 26      percent of behavioral health spending, and is the largest      source of funding for the country's public mental health      system. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the      Medicaid provisions of the AHCA would reduce Medicaid funding      over 10 years by $880 billion, or about 25 percent. With an      estimated 14 million people--one in five of Medicaid's 70      million enrollees--living with mental illness or substance      use disorders and depending heavily on Medicaid services,      allowing states to determine whether those services should be      covered could very well leave many low-income Americans      without access to medically necessary prevention and      treatment services.       Medicaid covers a broad range of behavioral health services      at low or no cost, including but not limited to psychiatric      hospital care, case management, day treatment, evaluation and      testing, psychosocial rehabilitation, medication management,      as well as individual, group and family therapy. In three      dozen states, Medicaid covers essential peer support services      to help sustain recovery. Additionally, because people with      behavioral health disorders experience a higher rate of      chronic physical conditions than the general population,      Medicaid's coverage of primary care is critical to help this      population receive needed treatment for both their behavioral      health and physical health conditions.       In states that have expanded Medicaid and which have been      particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, such as Kentucky,      Maine, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, Medicaid pays      between 35 to 50 percent of medication-assisted treatment for      substance use disorders. CARA and 21st Century Cures were to      increase payment for those services, but the elimination of      mandated coverage under Medicaid would likely result in state      cost shifting, so that CARA moneys (should they be      appropriated) and moneys provided under 21st Century Cures      for prescription opioid addiction prevention and treatment      services would supplant, rather than supplement, the existing      Medicaid coverage of services in the states.       Similarly, converting Medicaid into a per capita cap block      grant program or a simple block grant program will shift      significant costs to states over time. Ultimately, states      will be forced to reduce their Medicaid rolls, benefits, and      already low payment rates to an already scarce workforce of      behavioral health providers. Mental health and substance use      disorder treatments and programs will be at high risk      because, even though they are cost-effective, they are      intensive and expensive. Furthermore, the elimination of the      ACA's required Medicaid managed care coverage of mental      health and substance use disorder services and the long-term      reduction of real funding dollars will leave states and      managed care plans no alternative but to reduce or eliminate      services in order to balance state Medicaid budgets and      operate within managed care organizations' capitated rates.       In addition, these cuts will hit children with serious      emotional disorders, as well as adults with mental illness.      Fifty percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are children.      Seventy-five percent of mental conditions emerge by late      adolescence. The loss of Medicaid-covered mental and      substance use disorder services for adults would result in      more family disruption and out-of-home placements for      children, significant trauma which has its own long-term      health effects, and a further burden on a child welfare      system that is struggling to meet the current demand for      foster home capacity. In addition, we estimate $4 to $5      billion in Medicaid assistance will be lost by schools for      specialized instructional support services, including mental      and behavioral health services.       More directly, the rollback of the maximum eligibility      level for children ages 6 to 19 from 133 percent of the      Federal Poverty Level to 100 percent FPL will undoubtedly      have the result of reducing access to mental health and      substance use disorder services, and critical Early and      Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)      services, for those older children. This is a particularly      problematic change since 5 percent (1.2 million) of      adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 had substance use      disorders in 2015 and EPSDT screening is the most effective      early identifier for emergent mental health issues.               ahca changes to private insurance coverage       If Medicaid is not to provide the avenue for recovery for      individuals with mental illness or substance use disorders,      then the private insurance market may have to serve as an      alternative, but the $2,000 to $4,000 refundable tax credits      provided under the AHCA to subsidize insurance premiums      constitute a significant reduction in the advance premium tax      credits paid under the ACA, which averaged 72 percent of      gross premiums. Further, the 30 percent premium surcharge      required under AHCA to be imposed for a failure to maintain      continuous coverage will likely hit hardest the lowest-income      enrollees who will be struggling to maintain premium payments      for coverage. It will be particularly destructive for those      enrollees whose serious mental illness or substance use      disorders may render them cognitively impaired and thus      unable to maintain premium payment schedules until they      recover, when the sizeable surcharge will leave them unable      to pick up coverage. For the foregoing reasons, these      provisions of the AHCA leave us very concerned for the      continued well-being of the individuals with serious mental      illness and substance use disorders we have been better able      to serve since the implementation of the ACA's expanded      coverage.       We urge you to continue to protect these vulnerable      Americans' access to and coverage of vital mental health and      substance use disorder care and services, and to not reverse      the recent progress made with the enactment of key mental      health and substance use disorder prevention and treatment      reforms under the 21st Century Cures Act and           Sincerely,       American Art Therapy Association, American Association of      Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, American Association for      Marriage and Family Therapy, American Association for      Geriatric Psychiatry, American Association on Health and      Disability, American Dance Therapy Association, American      Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Nurses      Association, American Psychiatric Association, American      Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), American Psychological      Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, Anxiety      and Depression Association of America, Association for      Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare, Association for Behavioral      Health and Wellness, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law,      Campaign for Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice, Children      and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder      (CHADD), Clinical Social Work Association, Clinical Social      Work Guild 49-      Depression and Bi-Polar Support Alliance, Eating Disorders      Coalition, EMDR International Association, Global Alliance      for Behavioral Health and Social Justice, International      Certification & Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC), The Jewish      Federations of North America, Mental Health America, National      Association for Children's Behavioral Health, The National      Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental      Disability Directors (NACBHDD), The National Association for      Rural Mental Health (NARMH), National Association of Social      Workers, National Association of State Mental Health Program      Directors (NASMHPD), National Alliance on the Mental Illness      (NAMI), National Council for Behavioral Health, National      Disability Rights Network, National Federation of Families      for Children's Mental Health, National Health Care for the      Homeless Council, National Register of Health Service      Psychologists, No Health Without Mental Health (NHMH), School      Social Work Association of America, Trinity Health of      Livonia, Michigan, Young                                  ____                [From the New York Times, 23, 2017] Late G.O.Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy But Not                               Chemotherapy                        (By Margot Sanger-Katz)       Most Republicans in Congress prefer the type of health      insurance market in which everyone could ``choose the plan      that's right for them.''       Why should a 60-year-old man have to buy a plan that      includes maternity benefits he'll never use? (This is an      example that comes up a lot.) In contrast, the Affordable      Care Act includes a list of benefits that have to be in every      plan, a reality that makes insurance comprehensive, but often      costly.       Now, a group of conservative House members is trying to cut      a deal to get those benefit requirements eliminated as part      of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act      moving through (The vote in the House is expected      later today.)       At first glance, this may sound like a wonderful policy.      Why should that 60-year-old man have to pay for maternity      benefits he will never use? If 60-year-old men don't need to      pay for benefits they won't use, the price of insurance will      come down, and more people will be able to afford that      coverage, the thinking goes. And people who want fancy      coverage with extra benefits can just pay a little more for      the plan that's right for them.       But there are two main problems with stripping away minimum      benefit rules. One is that the meaning of ``health      insurance''[[Page H2385]]     can start to become a little murky. The second is that, in a      world in which no one has to offer maternity coverage, no      insurance company wants to be the only one that offers it.       Here is the list of Essential Health Benefits that are      required under the Affordable Care Act:       Ambulatory patient services (doctor's visits)       Emergency services       Hospitalization       Maternity and newborn care       Mental health and substance abuse disorder services,      including behavioral health treatment       Prescription drugs       Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices       Laboratory services       Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease      management       Pediatric services, including oral and vision care       The list reflects some lobbying of the members of Congress      who wrote it. You may notice that dental services are      required for children, but not adults, for example. But over      all, the list was developed to make insurance for people who      buy their own coverage look, roughly, like the kind of      coverage people get through their employer. A plan without      prescription drug coverage would probably be cheaper than one      that covers it, but most people wouldn't think of that plan      as very good insurance for people who have health care needs.       Under the Republican plan, the government would give people      who buy their own insurance money to help them pay for it. A      20-year-old who doesn't get coverage from work or the      government, for example, would get $2,000. If the essential      health benefits go away, insurance companies would be allowed      to sell health plans that don't cover, say, hospital care.      Federal money would help buy these plans.       But history illustrates a potential problem.       In the 1990s, Congress created a tax credit that helped      low-income people buy insurance for their children. Quickly,      it became clear that unscrupulous entrepreneurs were creating      cheap products that weren't very useful, and marketing them      to people eligible for the credit. Congress quickly repealed      the provision after investigations from the Government      Accountability Office and the Ways and Means Committee      uncovered fraud.       Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the      Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who tends      to favor market solutions in health care, said that while the      Obamacare rules are ``paternalistic,'' it would be      problematic to offer subsidies without standards. ``If      they're going to offer a tax credit for people who are buying      insurance, well, what is insurance?'' he said, noting that      you might end up with the government paying for plans that      covered aromatherapy but not hospital care. ``You have to      specify what's included.''       A proliferation of $1,995 plans that covered mostly      aromatherapy could end up costing the federal government a      lot more money than the current G.O.plan, since far more      people would take advantage of tax credits to buy cheap      products, even if they weren't very valuable.       There's another reason, besides avoiding fraud, that health      economists say benefit rules are important. Obamacare      requires insurers to offer health insurance to people who      have pre-existing illnesses at the same price as they sell      them to healthy people, and the Republican bill would keep      this rule. But if an insurance company designs a plan that      attracts a lot of sick people, it will be very expensive to      cover them, and the insurance company will either lose money      or end up charging extremely high prices that would drive      away any healthy customers.       Sherry Glied, the dean of the Robert Wagner Graduate      School of Public Service at New York University, who helped      work on the essential health benefits in the Obama      administration, raised the example of mental health benefits.      Parents of adolescents with schizophrenia will be sure to buy      insurance that covers only mental health services. Other      parents won't care about that benefit.       The result: Any company offering such benefits will end up      with a lot of customers requiring expensive hospitalizations,      while its competitors that drop them will get healthier      customers who are cheaper to insure. If mental health      services are optional, no insurance company will want to      offer them, lest all the families with sick children buy      their product and put them out of business.       And then healthy people who develop mental illness, or drug      addiction, will also learn that their illness isn't covered.      The result could be a sort of market failure: ``If you don't      require that these benefits are required, they often just get      knocked out of the market altogether,'' she said.       Before Obamacare passed, there were few federal standards      for health insurance bought by individuals, and it was not      uncommon to find plans that didn't include prescription drug      coverage, mental health services or maternity care. But plans      tended to cover most of the other benefits. That was in a      world where health insurers could discriminate against sick      people. In that era, insurers in most states could simply      tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't buy      insurance. That made it less risky for insurers to offer      mental health benefits to everyone else.       David Cutler, a professor at Harvard who helped advise the      Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act, said he      thinks the kind of insurance products that would be offered      under the proposed mix of policies could become much more      bare-bones than plans before He envisioned an      environment in which a typical plan might cover only      emergency care and basic preventive services, with everything      else as an add-on product, costing almost exactly as much as      it would cost to pay for a service out-of-pocket.       ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid-arthritis-     you-should-pay-$30,000 provision,'' he said. Such a system      would mean that Americans with costly problems--cancer,      opioid addiction, H.I.V.--would end up paying a substantially      higher share of their medical bills, while healthy people      would pay lower prices for insurance that wouldn't cover as      many treatments.       There is most likely a middle way. Republican lawmakers      might be comfortable with a system that shifts more of the      costs of care onto people who are sick, if it makes the      average insurance plan less costly for the healthy. But      making those choices would mean engaging in very real trade-     offs, less simple than their talking point.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.Visclosky).

Montenegro's accession to NATO will serve the strategic interests of the United States, it will help to promote stability in the Balkans, and it will make us safer. Montenegro has already proven its support for American interests, having sent troops to Afghanistan in support of NATO- and U.S.-led operations there. Although not yet a member of the European Union, Montenegro also voluntarily joined the EU sanctions regime against Russia in response to Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilizing actions in eastern Most important, I have great confidence that Montenegro will meet the collective defense obligations of NATO membership.  For the past 10 years, with the assistance of the Maine National Guard through the State Partnership Program, Montenegro has worked hard to reform its military and to strengthen the rule of law to come into compliance with NATO requirements, as defined in NATO's Membership Action Even today, Maine National Guard members are deployed to Montenegro to assist its Ministry of Defense in furthering its integration into NATO standards and processes.  I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all of the[[Page S1993]]members of the Maine National Guard who have participated in this operation, including the former and current adjutant general, GEN Bill Libby and GEN Doug Farnham, as well as our current guardsman stationed in Montenegro, Army CPT Nicolas All of them have worked very hard during the past 10 years to help Montenegro get ready for this highly significant moment.  We must be clear-eyed about the fact that the Russian Federation has undertaken an extensive overt and covert campaign to derail Montenegro's bid to join These efforts include a brazen plot to disrupt Montenegro's elections last October and to turn the public against the pro-NATO ruling government there. According to Montenegro's special prosecutor assigned to the investigation, at least two Russian intelligence officers actively participated in this plot, which fortunately was disrupted.  Ratifying Montenegro's NATO membership demonstrates our firm resolve against Russia's efforts to deny other countries the opportunity to participate in NATO free from outside interference. That is why the Supreme Allied Commander for Europe and NATO testified just last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee that it is ``absolutely critical'' that Montenegro join  As President Trump prepares to travel to the NATO leaders' summit in Brussels at the end of May, I can think of no better action for the Senate to have taken ahead of his visit than our action tonight to finally ratify Montenegro's membership in In the meantime, I also look forward to the continued special relationship between Montenegro and the great State of  Thank you, Mr. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

672,topic-id,2285,"Mr.President, confirming a Supreme Court nominee is one of the Senate's most significant constitutional responsibilities. I come[[Page S2021]]to the floor today to announce that I shall cast my vote for Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice of the U.Supreme In making my decision, I evaluated Judge Gorsuch's qualifications, experience, integrity, and temperament. I questioned him for more than an hour in a meeting in my office, evaluated his record, spoke with people who know him personally, and reviewed the Judiciary Committee's extensive hearing record. While I have not agreed with every decision Judge Gorsuch has made, my conclusion is that he is eminently well qualified to serve on our Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch has sterling academic and legal credentials. In 2006, the Senate confirmed this outstanding nominee by a voice vote to his current position on the U.Court of A rollcall vote was neither requested nor required.  Judge Gorsuch's ability as a legal scholar and judge has earned him the respect of members of the bar. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously given him its highest possible rating of ``well qualified.'' President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General testified before the Judiciary Committee in support of Judge Gorsuch, praising him as fair, decent, and committed to judicial independence.  I have also received a letter signed by 49 prominent Maine attorneys with diverse political views, urging support for Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They wrote:       Gorsuch's judicial record demonstrates his remarkable      intelligence, his keen ability to discern and resolve the      central issues at dispute in a legal proceeding . . . and his      dedication to the rule of law rather than personal      predilections. His judicial record also confirms that he is      committed to upholding the Constitution, enforcing the      statutes enacted by Congress, and restraining overreach by      the executive branch.  In my view, these are precisely the qualities that a Supreme Court Justice should embody.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Our personal discussion allowed me to assess the judge's philosophy and character. I told him that it was important to me that the judiciary remain an independent check on the other two branches of government as envisioned by our Therefore, I asked him specifically whether anyone in the administration had asked him how he would rule or sought any commitment from him on any issue. He was unequivocal that no one in the administration had asked him for such promises or to prejudge any issue that could come before him. He went on to say that the day a nominee answered how he would rule on a matter before it was heard or promised to overturn a legal precedent, that would be the end of an independent judiciary.  During the Judiciary Committee hearings, when Senator Lindsey Graham asked him a similar question about whether he was asked to make commitments about particular cases or precedents, he gave the same answer. In fact, Judge Gorsuch notably said that if someone had asked for such a commitment, he would have left the room because it would never be appropriate for a judge to make such a commitment, whether asked to do so by the White House or a U. Neil Gorsuch is not a judge who brings his personal views on any policy issues into the courtroom. If it can be said that Judge Gorsuch would bring a philosophy to the Supreme Court, it would be his respect for the rule of law and his belief that no one is above the law, including any President or any  I am convinced that Judge Gorsuch does not rule according to his personal views, but rather follows the facts and the law wherever they lead him, even if he is personally unhappy with the result. To paraphrase his answer to one of my questions about putting aside his personal views, he said that a judge who is happy with all of his rulings is likely not a good judge.  The reverence that Judge Gorsuch holds for the separation of powers, which is at the core of our American democracy, was also evident in our discussion. As he reiterated throughout his confirmation hearing, the duty to write the laws lies with Congress, not with the courts and not with the executive branch. Members of this body should welcome his deep respect for that fundamental principle.  Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates that he is well within the mainstream of judicial thought. He has joined in more than 2,700 opinions, 97 percent of which were unanimously decided, and he sided with the majority 99 percent of the time.  I asked Judge Gorsuch how he approaches legal precedents. I asked him if it would be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current Justices believed that a previous decision was wrongly decided. He responded: ``Emphatically no.'' And that, to me, is the right approach. He said a good judge always starts with precedent and presumes that the precedent is correct.  During his Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Gorsuch described precedent as ``the anchor of the law'' and ``the starting place for a judge.'' He has also coauthored a book on legal precedent with 12 other distinguished judges, for which Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the introduction.  Now, there has been considerable discussion over the course of this nomination process about the proper role of the courts in our constitutional system of government. It is also important for us to consider the roles that the executive and legislative branches play in the nomination process.  Under the Constitution, the President has wide discretion when it comes to nominations to the Supreme The Senate's role is not to ask, Is this the person whom I would have chosen to sit on the bench? Rather, the Senate is charged with evaluating each nominee's qualifications for serving on the  I have heard opponents of this nominee criticize him for a variety of reasons, including his methodology and charges that he is somehow extreme or outside of the mainstream. But I have not heard one Senator suggest that Judge Gorsuch lacks the intellectual ability, academic credentials, integrity, temperament or experience to serve on the U.Supreme Yet it is exactly those characteristics that the Senate should be evaluating when exercising its advice and consent duty.  This is especially true when Senators contemplate taking the extreme step of filibustering a Supreme Court nomination. As you well know, unfortunately, it has become Senate practice of late to filibuster almost every question before this body simply as a matter of course. But that would be a serious mistake in this case, and it would further erode the ability of this great institution to function. In 2005, when the Senate was mired in debate over how to proceed on judicial nominations, a bipartisan group of 14 Senators proposed a simple and reasonable standard. That group--of which I am proud to have been a part--declared that for Federal court nominations a Senator should only support a filibuster in the case of extraordinary circumstances.  Since coming to the Senate, I have voted to confirm four Justices to the Supreme Two were nominated by a Democratic President, and two were nominated by a Republican Each was confirmed: Chief Justice Roberts by a vote of 78 to 22, Justice Alito by a vote of 58 to 42, Justice Sotomayor by a vote of 68 to 31, and Justice Kagan by a vote of 63 to 37.  Before I became a Senator, this body confirmed Justice Kennedy, 97 to 0; Justice Scalia, 98 to 0; Justice Thomas, 52 to 48; Justice Ginsburg, 96 to 3; and Justice Breyer, 87 to 9.  Note that two of the current members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60 votes, but consistent with the standard that we established in 2005, neither one was filibustered.  Even Robert Bork, whose contentious confirmation hearings are said to have been the turning point in the Senate's treatment of Supreme Court nominations, was rejected by a simple failure to secure a majority of votes--42 yeas to 58 nays--not by a Senate filibuster. In fact, the filibuster has been used successfully only once in modern history to block a Supreme Court nomination. That was an attempt to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice in 1968, nearly half a century ago. In that case, Justice Fortas ended up withdrawing under an ethical cloud.[[Page S2022]]  The result of the votes on Justice Alito's nomination are also illuminating. In 2006 Senators voted to invoke cloture by a vote of 75 to 25. That is considerably more Senators than those who ultimately voted to confirm him, which was accomplished by a vote of 58 to 42. Here again, Senators proceeded to a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on the nomination.  Let me be clear. I do believe strongly that it is appropriate for the Senate to use its advice and consent power to examine nominations carefully or even to defeat them. In fact, I have voted against judicial nominees of three But playing politics with judicial nominees is profoundly damaging to the Senate's reputation and stature. It politicizes our judicial nomination process and threatens the independence of our courts, which are supposed to be above partisan politics. Perhaps most importantly, it undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary.  Since the Founders protected against the exertion of political influence on sitting Justices, the temptation to do everything in one's power to pick nominees with the right views is understandably very strong. But the more political Supreme Court appointments become, the more likely it is that Americans will question the extent to which the rule of law is being followed. It erodes confidence in the fair and impartial system of justice, and it cultivates a suspicion that judges are imposing their personal ideology.  The Senate has the responsibility to safeguard our Nation against a politicized judiciary. The Senate should resist the temptation to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee who is unquestionably qualified, the temptation to abandon the traditions of comity and cooperation, and the temptation to further erode the separation of powers by insisting on judicial litmus tests. It is time for the Senate to rise above partisanship and to allow each and every Senator to cast an up-or-down vote on this nominee.  This nomination deserves to move forward, as the dozens of distinguished Maine attorneys who wrote to me in support of his nomination said:       In sum, during his tenure on the U.Court of Appeals,      Judge Gorsuch distinguished himself as a judge who follows      the law with no regard for politics or outside influence.

237,topic-id,451,"Mr.Speaker, we are faced with an unenviable choice of the fact that there is infinite demand for health care. There is no top on the amount of healthcare cost necessary to provide all the health care that we want for everybody in this country, and we have limited resources within which to do that.  The real question is: Does ObamaCare take up that task by asking government to make those hard choices, or do we as individuals and families and caregivers make those harder choices for ourselves?  I believe that the bill that we will get to vote on today moves us toward that direction. This isn't about health care, per se; this is about how do you pay for it.  Insurance is not a magic bullet anywhere across the spectrum. Insurance is simply a scheme in which we risk-manage together. We put a certain amount of money into a bucket, assuming not all of us will suffer the risks that we want to cover. If we do, we have got to put more money in; if we don't, then the system works.  This is about having to confront that choice that there is way too much cost for the amount of resources that are available in any of these circumstances, and it is hard.  Many of my constituents ask: Why did Republicans spend 6 years railing against ObamaCare and not have the fix available on Inauguration Day? Well, this is Exhibit This is hard stuff. Even among Republicans, we have got more than 218 votes among us, and we can't agree among ourselves necessarily what ought to go forward.  But I do know this, that we are down to the final choice: Do we keep ObamaCare and the failure that is confronting us and will continue to be there, or do we take a chance on moving toward something different, moving toward freedom, moving toward choice, giving States back the opportunity to decide for their indigent population how they should take care of them?  I don't think anybody in Washington, D.C., can come up with a plan that fixes that for all 50 I trust my colleagues in Austin to make that happen far better than anybody I would trust in D.C., and this bill moves that direction, and that is the right direction for us to go.  This is a hard choice, but for me it is relatively straightforward. You keep ObamaCare with a ``no'' vote. You move toward a brighter future for health care in this country and the way we pay for it, who pays for it, and how we get that done by a ``yes'' vote. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2393.txt,1805,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,March

It actually led to a famine in Ukraine, killing millions of people because he insisted on his political brand of agricultural science, which wasn't science at all.  My friend from Massachusetts I think is wrong when he asks: What is the emergency? I don't think he understands that, from the Republican point of view, science mixed with public policy is an emergency. We have to do something about it.  The world was created 4,273 years ago and carbon dating is a fraud. As your coastal areas are under water, think about the comfort of Republican philosophy: it is just a theory, and disputable at that. By the way, let's defund any research on it. Let's back out of our commitments. Let's be the only major nation in the world that denies that climate change is real and is going to affect us in almost every aspect of our lives moving forward, including our children and their children.  We owe them better. That is the emergency. God forbid the Environmental Protection Agency have policies and regulations that are science-based. God forbid we look at empirical research to guide us in making thoughtful policies to protect the public. God forbid we look at the science of lead and other toxins in water supplies, let's save $7 million in Flint, Just today they announced a $100 million settlement. That anti-scientific decision, that political decision, put the people of Flint, Michigan, at risk, and it is now going to cost $100 million to fix.  That is the consequences of an anti-empirical philosophy, and that will be the consequence of polluting this board with corporations and corporate representatives who are guilty of polluting in the first place. Of course, they won't welcome regulation of their own respective industries, and the Republicans are their enablers. That is what is going to happen if this bill passes.  With respect to Russia, each day there are more troubling revelations that make clear that senior-level Trump officials had undisclosed contact with Russian officials about the campaign, perhaps, the transition, and about sanctions. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was fired after only 3 weeks on the job for lying about this very thing to the Vice President of the United Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from any Russian probe because of compromised testimony at his nomination hearing. FBI Director James Comey confirmed an investigation into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russian officials.  What has been the most visible reaction from my friends on the other side of the aisle in this Congress?  The frenetic behavior of the Intelligence Committee chairman that has seemingly compromised the committee's ability to investigate.  This ought not to be about partisan politics.

It requires some seniors to pay 100 percent or more of their income in premiums.  This legislation dramatically cuts Medicaid, directly contradicting President Trump's claim not to.  In Michigan, HALF of all children rely on  In my district alone, 56,000 people will lose coverage, including 16,000 children.  Let's be clear: if we pass this bill, children, seniors, and working people will suffer and some will die, so that the wealthy can get a tax cut.  Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. That's why I support a single-payer, Medicare-for-All plan, and why I will be voting ``no'' on this mean spirited legislation.  Mr.Speaker, as Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee, I include in the Record a legal analysis prepared by committee staff that concludes that the provision of H.1628 that requires New York State to change how its counties fund the State's portion of Medicaid expenses is not related to a legitimate Federal interest, that no rational Federal purpose has been proffered for the provision, and that it would severely intrude on traditional state prerogatives. As such, this provision would violate Constitutional limits on the Federal Spending Power, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Tenth Amendment (reserving all undelegated powers to the States) and would likely be held unconstitutional if challenged in court.                               Memorandum     To: Interested     From: House Judiciary Committee Democratic     Re: Constitutionality of Faso-Collins     Date: March 24, 2017.       The Faso-Collins amendment, incorporated into the Manager's      amendment, would violate Constitutional limits on the Federal      Spending Power, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses      and the Tenth Amendment (reserving all undelegated powers to      the States). Requiring New York State to change how its      counties Fund its portion of Medicaid expenses is not related      to a legitimate Federal interest, no rational Federal purpose      has been proffered for the provision, and it would severely      intrude on traditional state prerogatives.       If the Faso-Collins amendment were ever enacted, it quickly      would be invalidated by the Federal courts. The irony of this      ``buyout'' is that the ``payment'' supposedly being delivered      in exchange for votes--the unconstitutional provision--is the      legislative equivalent of a check on a closed bank account,      which will never deliver the promised benefits.       For the last 51 years, New York State has chosen to fund a      portion of its share of the Medicaid Program by using funds      from county property taxes. Fifteen other States structure      Medicaid funding through a similar legally authorized system.       The Faso-Collins amendment specifies that any State that      had an allotment of Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)      funds that was more than 6 times the national average, and      that requires subdivisions with populations of less than      5,000,000 to contribute toward Medicaid costs, shall have its      reimbursement reduced by the amount of contributions by such      subdivisions. (This effectively limits the application to New      York State, and carves out New York City.) Under the      amendment, New York State is at risk of losing $2.3 billion      of its $32 billion in Federal Medicaid funds.       This provision is unconstitutional, and could be struck      down for several reasons:       Violation of Limits on Spending Power--Article I of the      Constitution grants Congress spending power to ``provide for      the . . . general Welfare.'' In South Dakota v. Dole, 483      U.203 (1987), the Supreme Court held that any spending      condition imposed on the States must be related to the      Federal interest in that particular project or program and      that Congress cannot coerce the States into compliance with      the Federal government's objectives. In NFIB v. Sebelius, 132      2566 (2012), the Supreme Court found provisions of the      Affordable Care Act which required all States to comply with      the law's Medicaid expansion violated this spending      authority, noting the ``Constitution has never been      understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the      States to govern according to Congress' instructions.'' The      Faso-Collins language does not appear to be related to any      Federal interest in the use or allocation of Federal Medicaid      funds: it does not further Medicaid's purposes and has      nothing to do with ensuring the proper disbursement of      Federal funds. Indeed, because the provision applies to      counties in a single State--and leaves the very same system      undisturbed in 15 other States--it could not possibly be      justified by any legitimate Federal interest.       An additional line of Supreme Court cases, including New      York v. United States, 505 U.144, 167, 172 (1992), has      held that conditions on Federal grants must be ``reasonably      related to the purpose of the [Federal] expenditure'' because      otherwise ``the spending power could render academic the      Constitution's other grants and limits of Federal      authority.'' Likewise, in Massachusetts v. United States, 435      U.444, 461 (1978), the Supreme Court noted that it has      ``repeatedly held that the Federal Government may impose      appropriate conditions on the use of Federal property or      privileges and may require that State instrumentalities      comply with conditions that are reasonably related to the      Federal interest in particular national projects or      programs.'' Under these precedents, the Faso-Collins language      would be held to be an arbitrary exercise of Federal power      which intrudes on only one particular State's sovereign tax      powers, and is unrelated to any Federal interest or purpose      in the Medicaid       As Yale Law School Professor Abbe Gluck wrote in a post on      the Balkinzation blog today, the Faso-Collins ``amendment is      likely unconstitutional. The protection from federal      interference of the internal functions of a state government      is one of the bedrocks of state sovereignty protected by the      limitations on Congress's powers in Article I of the      Constitution and the reservation of power to the states in      the Tenth Amendment.'' She further reasoned that ``Even if      one could argue that this is an exercise of the federal      spending power under Article I, for Congress to legally use      that power, the conditions on a state's use of federal      funding have to be tied to a reasonable federal propose . . .      It is hard to see a reasonable federal purpose here other      than garnering more GOP votes for the struggling repeal      bill.'' (available at https://ballkin.blogspot.com/2017/03/is-gop-aca-repealer-unconstitutional-on.html?m=1)       Violation of Due Process and Equal Protection--Under the      Fifth Amendment, the Federal government is not permitted to      deprive its citizens of equal protection or due process of      law. Those clauses have been interpreted on numerous      occasions to prevent the government from discriminating      between the treatment of the sovereign States absent a      rational basis. For example, in Helvering v. David, 301 U.     619, 640 (1937), the Supreme Court warned that Congress does      not possess the right to demonstrate a ``display of arbitrary      power'' in its treatment of the various In this      regard, in 2009, when an earlier Senate version of the      Affordable Care Act sought to provide special treatment for      Nebraska with respect to Medicaid reimbursements, 13      Republican State attorneys general wrote to Congress      (available at http://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/career-servicesifiles/Letter%20to%      20the%20 Honorable%20Nancy %20Pelosi%20 and%20the      %20Honorable%20Harry %20Reid.pdf) asserting the provision was      unconstitutional (the provision was ultimately dropped). In      the case of the Faso-Collins language, there is no legitimate      policy justification for developing a special rule limiting      Medicaid funds for New York as compared to all other States,      including 15 States which have sharing agreements with their      counties. Nor has a justification been offered for why New      York City should be excluded from the application of the      special rule. As such, it is clear that the provision is      discriminatory, ``arbitrary'' and has no rational basis.       Abrogation of Tenth Amendment Principles--The Tenth      Amendment provides in relevant part that powers not delegated      to the Federal government or prohibited to the States are      reserved for the This has been read to prevent the      federal government from ``commandeering'' the states to serve      its own purposes. In Printz v. United States, 521 U.898      (1997), the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot      commandeer State officers to implement Federal policy--in      that case requiring criminal background checks for handgun      purchases pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention      The Faso-Collins language commandeers New York State      government to facilitate the partisan political ends of a      faction in the U.Congress, which would seem well outside      the proscriptions of In fact, by essentially ordering      New York to reorganize its internal affairs, the Faso-Collins      amendment may run even further afoul of Tenth Amendment      principles than was the case in Printz given the lack of a      Federal purpose and the interference with the core sovereign      function of how a State chooses to use its taxing power.       It is of particular constitutional concern that the Faso-     Collins provision directly interferes with New York's      internal decisions about how to structure its own tax and      spending policies, and how to allocate those responsibilities      between the State and its subdivisions--which is a core      function of a sovereign entity protected by the Tenth      Amendment (and potentially Article IV 4 of the      Constitution, which provides that the ``United States shall      guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of      Government.''). This is constitutionally significant because      in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.533, 575 (1964), the Supreme      Court held that political subdivisions such as counties and      cities ``have been traditionally regarded as subordinate      governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist      in the carrying[[Page H2441]]     out of State governmental functions.'' In Hunter v. City of      Pittsburgh, 207 U.161, 178 (1907), the Court noted that      these subdivisions are ``created as convenient agencies for      exercising such of the governmental powers of the state, as      may be entrusted to them'' and that the ``number, nature, and      duration of powers conferred upon these [entities] and the      territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the      absolute discretion of the state.'' The Faso-Collins      amendment purports to invoke Federal power to displace New      York's sovereign exercise of this ``absolute discretion''      and, for that reason, violates the As Chief      Justice John Marshall long ago explained in Gibbons v. Ogden,      22 U.1, 198-200 (1824), the States' ``power of taxation is      indispensable to their existence. . . . In imposing taxes for      State purposes, [States] are not doing what Congress is      empowered to do. Congress is not empowered to tax for those      purposes which are within the exclusive province of the      States.''                                  ____                                   Office of the Attorney General,                                      State of South Carolina,                                                December 30, 2009.     Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       The undersigned state attorneys general, in response to      numerous inquiries, write to express our grave concern with      the Senate version of the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act (``H.3590''). The current iteration of the bill      contains a provision that affords special treatment to the      state of Nebraska under the federal Medicaid program. We      believe this provision is constitutionally flawed. As chief      legal officers of our states we are contemplating a legal      challenge to this provision and we ask you to take action to      render this challenge unnecessary by striking that provision.       It has been reported that Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson's      vote, for H.3590, was secured only after striking a deal      that the federal government would bear the cost of newly      eligible Nebraska Medicaid enrollees. In marked contrast all      other states would not be similarly treated, and instead      would be required to allocate substantial sums, potentially      totaling billions of dollars, to accommodate H.3590's new      Medicaid mandates. In addition to violating the most basic      and universally held notions of what is fair and just, we      also believe this provision of H.3590 is inconsistent with      protections afforded by the United States Constitution      against arbitrary legislation.       In Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S 619, 640 (1937), the United      States Supreme Court warned that Congress does not possess      the right under the Spending Power to demonstrate a ``display      of arbitrary power.'' Congressional spending cannot be      arbitrary and capricious. The spending power of Congress      includes authority to accomplish policy objectives by      conditioning receipt of federal funds on compliance with      statutory directives, as in the Medicaid program. However,      the power is not unlimited and ``must be in pursuit of the      `general welfare.' '' South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.203, 207      (1987). In Dole the Supreme Court stated, ``that conditions      on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated      to the federal interest in particular national projects or      programs.'' at 207. It seems axiomatic that the federal      interest in H.3590 is not simply requiring universal      health care, but also ensuring that the states share with the      federal government the cost of providing such care to their      citizens. This federal interest is evident from the fact this      legislation would require every state, except Nebraska, to      shoulder its fair share of the increased Medicaid costs the      bill will generate. The provision of the bill that relieves a      single state from this cost-sharing program appears to be not      only unrelated, but also antithetical to the legitimate      federal interests in the bill.       The fundamental unfairness of H.3590 may also give rise      to claims under the due process, equal protection, privileges      and immunities clauses and other provisions of the      As a practical matter, the deal struck by the      United States Senate on the ``Nebraska Compromise'' is a      disadvantage to the citizens of 49 states. Every state's tax      dollars, except Nebraska's, will be devoted to cost-sharing      required by the bill, and will be therefore unavailable for      other essential state programs. Only the citizens of Nebraska      will be freed from this diminution in state resources for      critical state services. Since the only basis for the      Nebraska preference is arbitrary and unrelated to the      substance of the legislation, it is unlikely that the      difference would survive even minimal scrutiny.       We ask that Congress delete the Nebraska provision from the      pending legislation, as we prefer to avoid litigation.      Because this provision has serious implications for the      country and the future of our nation's legislative process,      we urge you to take appropriate steps to protect the      Constitution and the rights of the citizens of our nation. We      believe this issue is readily resolved by removing the      provision in question from the bill, and we ask that you do      so.       By singling out the particular provision relating to      special treatment of Nebraska, we do not suggest there are no      other legal or constitutional issues in the proposed health      care legislation.       Please let us know if we can be of assistance as you      consider this matter.

396,topic-id,474,"Mr.President, I work very close with my friend from There were some awfully strong things that were just said. I don't think they were directed necessarily at me.  I think there has been a little bit of an evolution here. I know that the reason we are having to go through this process of filibustering a treaty is the fact that the Senator from Kentucky wanted a vote on an unrelated amendment relative to surveillance here in our own country. When he was unable to get that agreement, he decided to filibuster a treaty. So that is what is happening here.  I am interested to hear this evolution of why we are having this debate. Let me just say, having dealt with this issue firsthand--and I know he knows this--this filibuster is about something totally unrelated to the amendment that is being offered right now.  I know the Senator from Kentucky, my friend, knows that I have offered authorizations for the use of force. I did so against Syria, and I am glad to have a debate on authorizations for the use of force, and I think we should. I know the administration is developing a strategy around ISIS right now, and when they complete that, it is my hope that we will, in fact, update the 2001  I think it has been stated by past administrations that the authorization they are utilizing as it relates to ISIS is legal. I believe them to be correct. But I will say that I agree we ought to have another debate on the issue of authorizing the fight against ISIS, and I hope we will do so as soon as this administration completes the process of laying out what their plan is. Then we can debate that and then hopefully update that authorization. I don't know what that has to do with a treaty with There has been a lot that has been said, and I don't know how it necessarily ties together. But the fact is, when you enter into an article 5 treaty--which has, by the way, passed out of our committee on two occasions--you are, in fact, saying under article 5 that a war against one is a war against all and that we will come to their defense. So the amendment itself, if we were to vote on it, would basically negate that.  I think the Senator from Kentucky could have had this vote, but the fact is that 98 Senators wanted to have this vote--have wanted to have this vote for months, I might add--and we have had to come to this point of filing cloture.  So, with that, with good will toward the Senator, with good will toward the other 97 Senators here who would like to pass this posthaste, I object.  The PRESIDING Objection is heard.

684,topic-id,2665,"Mr.President, we find ourselves at an interesting point. Let me start by saying what a tremendous privilege it is to serve in this body. Every single day that I come to the building from where I live, I express that to myself--what a tremendous privilege it is for all of us to serve in this body, denoted by many as the greatest deliberative body in the world. Certainly, we find ourselves here in a place where we can effect so many things that not only affect our citizens but citizens across the world. What a privilege that is.  The Presiding Officer and I have had numerous conversations in the past. I spent a life in business before coming to the Senate, and I know the Presiding Officer did a lot of unique things as well. At the age of 25, I was fortunate enough to build a business, starting with a small amount of money. It ended up operating all around the country. One of the things we did after every project--I built shopping centers around the country--is that we would get together and analyze the things we had done well and the things we had done not so well in an effort to become better. At the end of each year, we would sit down and look at our company, which was growing very rapidly, and try to analyze those things. Sometimes we would have setbacks, but generally speaking, the company continued to operate on an upward trend.  What I find here is just the opposite. I have been here now a decade, and what we do is just the opposite of that. What we do is we continue a downward trend because the way the two parties operate with each other is when it gets to a point where there is something very critical that has to happen, the other side says, well, if they were in power, this is what they would do, so let's go ahead and do this ourselves. So what we have in the Senate, at least since I have been here in the last decade, is instead of an escalating situation where we continue to operate better and deal with these things in a more balanced way, what we do is we are on this continual downward trend.  One of our younger Members mentioned the other day as we were discussing this--and I thought it was a great point--that what has happened in the Senate is that neither party has had the ability to withstand the pressure that is brought to them by their base in either party.  I have seen that play out right now. What happens is their base puts pressure on, and we end up breaking the traditions of the We did it legislatively with the cloture vote being the scored vote by outside groups. So that is where we find ourselves.  What is happening in our own caucus--I just realized over the weekend--is that we are now trying to figure out whom to blame. I heard a discussion last Wednesday that was totally divorced from reality as far as how we had gotten where we are today. I realized that we are getting ready to do some things here that will change the Senate dramatically. What is really happening is that both sides are trying to make sure history records that it was the other side that caused this to happen.  We are now starting to see editorials in various publications--some that we Republicans read and some that Democrats read--to try to set the story straight. I about came out of my chair last Wednesday with regard to one of the explanations as to how we got where we are today. My guess is, today at lunch on the other side of the aisle, the same thing will be taking place. Obviously, on our side, it is the other side. On their side, it is our side.  Let me go back to 2013. We had a breakdown taking place. President Obama was bringing forth some nominations, and it was right after he was elected for a second term. We went through the summer of 2013 with some of his nominees not getting cloture votes. I was called, as were a few other Senators, to make what we would call some tough votes. These were nominees whom we did not support. Cloture had again become the vote that people were scoring, but I and John McCain and Lamar Alexander and a few others were asked to make some votes that, candidly, were not very pleasant to keep us from getting to a place at which Senator Reid would impose the nuclear option.  We made it through the summer, and we went into the fall. We had just confirmed a new circuit court judge for the[[Page S2030]]DC Circuit, which is just below the Supreme Court relative to importance for lots of reasons. So we had a 4-to-4 balance on this circuit court. Senator Reid brought forth three more nominees, and they were not bad nominees. I think most people thought they were actually pretty decent nominees. But we did not want the balance of the DC Circuit to change; it was at 4-to-4.  We know that a lot of administrative rulings that are relative to the administration take place in the DC court, so we made the argument that there were already enough judges there and that they did not have a very good case. It was the same argument, by the way, that Democrats made back in 2006 when Bush was also trying to make some nominations. We do the same to each other. So we ended up filibustering those three nominees.  What we thought was going to take place was a negotiation on how many judges would actually go when all of a sudden Senator Reid, out of the blue, with some of his Members not realizing what had happened, did the nuclear option. He ruled and called upon the person sitting in the Chair and the All of a sudden, we destroyed what had been the case of it taking 60 votes to move beyond to an actual vote on the nominee. I was livid.  Somebody said the other day that that was fine and that we had just gotten to where we had wanted to be. Are you kidding me? We were livid. We were livid that on some circuit court nominees, Senator Reid had pulled the nuclear option.  I will tell you this: There were days--not days, months--where people who had normally worked with people on the other side of the aisle just kind of shut down. It was hard to believe the nuclear option had been invoked.  Last Wednesday, somebody acted like it was no big deal, that it had just gotten us back to where we had always been. The fact is that we have not used filibusters much--years ago. The fact is that we are using them a lot today. Look, this was a big deal.  Now we find ourselves in a situation in which we are getting ready to take the last step, if you will, on nominations. Let's face it: We have a nominee in this judge who is on the floor who is really beyond reproach.  I realize my friends on the other side of the aisle have pressures. I have talked to some of them, and I respect them. I understand that their base is saying that because of what we did last year. Remember, it had been an hour since the great Justice passed away, and we had already declared we were not going to allow another Justice to be confirmed until after the Presidential race. It was a pretty audacious move, let's face it, and obviously it created some hard feelings on the other side of the aisle after the election was determined.  Within their base, many of them are saying they are going to invoke the filibuster here. Our leadership is saying: If that happens, then we ourselves have to invoke the nuclear option on the Supreme Court  We understand where this is going. I do not know what has been said on the floor other than during the hearings, but let's face it: One side is reacting to their base, to their pressure. They are having ads run against them if they are even considering voting to move beyond the cloture vote to an actual vote on the nominee. On our side, obviously, we are in a situation in which, if that happens, then our leader is going to call the nuclear option.  By the way, everybody says: Oh, we are never going to do it on legislation. Come on. Let me go back to that for a minute.  Back in 2010, the Democrats passed a healthcare bill with 60 votes. Then there was an election, and it took them down below 60 votes. They just needed to fix a little element on the healthcare bill with a reconciliation bill, and the Republicans went crazy over that. How many times have we talked about their passing this healthcare bill with reconciliation? It has been going on for 7 years. Now we are in the driver's seat. We have the majority. We are writing an entire bill through reconciliation because we understand the power of being able to do something with 51 votes. I understand. So what we do is we just keep upping the ante with each other. Are you kidding me?  If we continue on the path we are on right now, the very next time there is a legislative proposal that one side of the aisle feels is so important, they cannot let their base down, the pressure builds, then we are going to invoke the nuclear option on a legislative piece. That is what will happen. Somebody will do it. Somebody will say that if they were in control, they would do it. That is the way trust has gotten around here. So we ought to do it because this is our opportunity to really change history.  Look, I hope that before we move to the place that we all know we are going--I do not think anybody here would deny that pressures have built. Let's face it. If we do not have respect for the institution we serve and for ourselves, no one else will. Who will? These people know what we are getting ready to do to this place. For us to act like if we do it here, there is no way we would ever do it on a legislative piece--let me tell you this: Two years ago, after Senator Reid did what he did--a friend of mine and somebody I worked very closely with, I think most people know it took me a while to get back to normal with him. Two years ago, there would not have been a single Republican in our caucus who would have even considered voting for the nuclear option. As a matter of fact, we had discussions about changing it back. Then the election occurred, and we decided not to do that.  What it looks like to me is that there is a whole host of Republican Senators who are willing to do that today. Everyone knows that on the other side of the aisle--maybe everyone; I don't know. Yet to say that we will never get to the point at which we will not change a legislative piece--give me a break. Somebody is not living in reality, because we each continue to take the other down.  Again, I do not really care how history writes it; I am going to tell you how I am going to write it. Neither side of the aisle has had the maturity or the willingness to stand up to the pressures and cause this institution to operate in the way it should--neither side of the aisle. As for anybody who tries to say that one side of the aisle is worse than the other, come on. It takes two of us to take the institution to the place at which we are getting ready to take it next week. That is my history. I have been here 10 years. I have watched it. Neither side of the aisle has clean hands. We have one side. They have a decision to make. Are they really going to filibuster this judge? Let's face it. If you go back and look at the principles of the Gang of 14 that were put in place back in the 2000s, when both sides came together and said: We are not going to do the nuclear option as long as a judge meets these criteria--this judge meets that criteria. It is clear. By the way, I am not criticizing; I am just observing.  We both have pressures. We know that if a filibuster takes place--and you will know that immediately; of course, it would be after a few filibuster votes just to show that it cannot happen--the leader on this side is going to invoke the nuclear option. You all know that. I do not know if people are saying that it could happen, but of course that is what is going to happen. And then the very next time another big legislative issue comes up, the same thing is going to happen unless we have the ability to sit down and talk about this. I would love to do it out on the floor. Typically, we do not do those kinds of things because things get out of control when we talk about things honestly here on the floor, but I would like for us to do that. I would love for us to have maybe a 4-hour discussion about what we are getting ready to do here in the To me, that would be a healthy thing.  I think all of these staffers who work up here, whom we respect, know exactly what is getting ready to happen here in the  I think we owe this to people who are getting ready to run for the Senate or maybe to people who are thinking about running for reelection. We should go ahead and have this discussion so that they will know whether they are running for a 6-year House term--a 6-year House term because we do not have the maturity, because we do not trust each other, because we are on this constantly deescalating deal and our leaders do not talk to each other and fight and all of those kinds of things happen, because we are getting ready to take this institution to a[[Page S2031]]place that I do not think many of us are going to be proud of. But, again, for the people who are thinking about running for the Senate, let's go ahead and clear it. Let's have a discussion about this legislative issue so that people will know, if they are seeking election to the U.Senate, that they are, in essence, going to sign up, possibly, for a 6-year House term.  I am at a place in my Senate life where I have tremendous respect for the people with whom I have served. Every day I come here, I look at the things I have the ability to affect as one I look at that with such honor, to be able to be in a body that debates these kinds of things and affects people in the way we do. What an honor it is to be here. I am here with no malice.  I am here, though, at a time when I see what is getting ready to happen without a lot of discussion, and I hope that somehow or another, we will have the ability to avoid what I see as something that is very, very detrimental to the Senate and, in the process, very detrimental to our country.

As the Nation--and perhaps even the world--knows, we held lengthy hearings last week to review his qualifications, his experience, and his approach to judging. I have to say that he really impressed everybody who approached this whole issue with an open mind about whether he was qualified to serve on the High But unfortunately, as those of us who work in the Senate know, there has already been a threat by the Democratic leader to filibuster his nomination.  It is really important for the country to recall that there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a nominee to the U.Supreme Sometimes people want to talk about Abe Fortas in 1968, but ultimately Abe Fortas, who was nominated to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by his friend and mentor, Lyndon Johnson, asked to withdraw his nomination after one failed cloture vote and ultimately ended up resigning from the Supreme Court of the United States in disgrace. It is hardly a precedent for what Democrats have said they are going to do with regard to this good man and this good judge, Neil  I understand my friend the Democratic leader has a tough job. He has a split caucus--those who want to take Democrats over the ledge and those who would like to try to find some way to work out a reasonable accommodation. Unfortunately, he is under a lot of pressure from the radical groups on the left to do whatever he can to tank this superb nominee. Again, this would be unprecedented in American history.  It is true that Democrats in 2013 did the so-called nuclear option, which has established a new precedent in the Senate with regard to lower court judges--circuit court judges and district court judges--along with Cabinet nominees. Ironically, the so-called Reid precedent of 2013 has kind of come back to bite them a little bit, as President Trump now has been able to see all of his Cabinet members confirmed with 51 votes, or, in the case of one, 50 plus the Vice  I was glad to see a quote from a report in a Vermont publication from our friend the senior Senator from Vermont, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in which he said he wasn't inclined to filibuster the nomination of Judge Gorsuch and that he deserves a minimum of an up-or-down vote. So I hope others will follow the lead of Senator Leahy, who has been in the Senate a long time in the majority and in the minority. He realizes it is important to maintain a certain level of tradition and decorum here in the Senate, because usually what goes around comes around. Unfortunately, this new precedent of filibustering Supreme Court Justices, if allowed to happen, is going to continue to be very damaging to the Senate and even to the country.  I hope he is still of that same mind--that he is not inclined to filibuster the nomination of Judge If he takes that position, I know he will influence a lot of colleagues on the other side of the aisle because of his distinguished record of service in the Senate and in the Judiciary  I look forward to the committee approving Judge Gorsuch's nomination next week and then taking that nomination up on the Senate floor and confirming the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Associate Justice on the U.Supreme                               ObamaCare  Mr.President, last week, a lot of attention was focused on the House of Representatives and their efforts to fix our Nation's healthcare system.  We have said for a long time that ObamaCare needs to be repealed and replaced. I stand by that comment, and I know many of our colleagues do as well. But I want to make something else clear. The failure of ObamaCare isn't a problem for Democrats or Republicans alone. It is a problem for the entire country, and particularly those who find their premiums going up by double digits every year, their deductibles unaffordable, or even choices drying up because insurance companies simply have withdrawn from the individual market. Our colleagues on the Democratic side have repeatedly recognized the problems with ObamaCare, even though they pushed it through on a partisan vote 7 years ago.  The fact of the matter is that the President promised: If you like your healthcare policy, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; and, premiums for a family of four will go down by an average of $2,500. None of that has proven to be true. People were misled into believing that ObamaCare would somehow be the gold standard for healthcare in the country, and people are being hurt now by high premiums, high deductibles, and fewer choices. Indeed, 30 million people remain uninsured in this country because of the cost or the fact that they just decide that they don't want to buy government-mandated healthcare. They either pay a penalty through the IRS or they simply get a hardship exemption. There are 30 million people currently uninsured, more or less, under  I want to remind our colleagues on the other side that they understand ObamaCare needs some work, and many of them have made repeated calls to fix it. Last year, for example, the junior Senator from Wisconsin said of ObamaCare:       There were things obviously that need perfecting, need      revisiting. Even if it were perfect, over time we would have      to make adaptations, and so I think we would absolutely want      to strengthen it.  Not even our colleague, the junior Senator from Wisconsin, is saying ObamaCare is delivering 100 percent on the promise. She is saying it needs some work.  The senior Senator from Indiana has echoed this sentiment. He said:       I supported the Affordable Care Act because I wanted to      help working- and middle-class families to have access to      healthcare. That doesn't mean the law is perfect, and it      doesn't mean that we don't still have work to do. That's why      I'm working with my colleagues to make this bill stronger.  We haven't seen any proposals from our friends across the aisle on how to fix the law, which they concede is far from perfect. Instead, what we have seen is their standing back, watching Republicans trying to do this by ourselves and coming up short last week in the House of To my mind, that is not commendable behavior on their part. I thought we all came here to the U.Senate to try to do things and fix problems for the constituents we represent. It is purely partisan to say: We know ObamaCare is falling apart, and it is not delivering as we promised. And, oh yes, you Republicans can try to fix it, but if you don't have the votes to do it, we are just going to sit back and applaud or react with glee from a partisan perspective because our political opponents somehow came up short when it came to the votes in the  The truth is, ObamaCare didn't bring massive relief for working- and middle-class For many, it made life more difficult with skyrocketing premiums, losing their plans and the doctors they wanted, and having fewer options to choose from.  I will quote one of our colleagues on the other side of the isle, the junior Senator from North Her website says: ``With any major legislation, there are improvements that need to be made so that it works as well as possible, and that holds true for the[[Page S1986]]healthcare reform law,'' speaking of  She goes on to say that she is committed to ``correcting the parts of the healthcare reform law that do not make sense, improve on others, and implement new ideas to improve on healthcare costs and improve quality.''  I am grateful to our colleague from North Dakota for her honesty and open take on where things stand with respect to ObamaCare, but that is just a start. What we need to do now is work together to try to address the failings of ObamaCare where it is not delivering as promised and where even our colleagues across the aisle have said that it needs to be fixed in order to make sure that people have access to affordable, accessible quality healthcare. They don't have that now.  My point is that ObamaCare was a bill sold to the American people under false pretenses by the previous administration, and it has proved to be a disaster for many people. I was reading an article--I think it was either in the Washington Post or the New York Times today--about a woman in Texas who runs a hair care salon and who has intentionally kept her number of employees under the threshold under which ObamaCare's employer mandate would be invoked. So rather than spending time focusing on growing her business and improving her business, she has consciously kept it smaller, with fewer employees, because she knows that the burden of complying with the ObamaCare employer mandate will ultimately make her business less profitable. And when her business is less profitable, it means she can hire fewer people and perhaps can't pay the wages or the benefits she would like to pay her employees.  So I would just say to our colleagues across the aisle that I understand you think you had a pretty good day last week when the Republicans couldn't pass the healthcare plan on their own in the House, but I don't think this is a time for people to enjoy other people's failed efforts to try to improve the status quo. It is a mandate, I believe, for all of us to work together to address the flaws that we know exist--that they admitted exist--to try to do better when it comes to affordable, accessible healthcare for the American people.  This law will fail. Insurance companies will withdraw from the market, and the individual market serving roughly 18 million people will literally dry up and go away. Imagine how those families are going to be impacted.  I wouldn't want to be somebody who said: Well, I had an opportunity to fix it; yes, I had an opportunity to address your concerns when it came to affordable healthcare, but for partisan political reasons, I simply stood down and did nothing and literally washed my hands of it.  So before this law collapses--and it will--I hope our colleagues across the aisle will start offering their ideas and their solutions to bring better healthcare to families across the country. That is what I think our constituents expect of us. That is in the finest tradition of the U.Senate, and our constituents deserve no less.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

670,topic-id,2102,"Mr.President, I came to the floor to talk about the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as the next Supreme Court Justice, and I happened to walk in while the Democratic leader was speaking. In the brief time I heard him comment this morning, I concluded that basically the Democrats are against everything. They are against everything. He knows as well as anybody that when the President sends over a budget, it is a proposal by the President that Congress routinely changes, arriving at its own budget priorities, working with the White                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, before I get too distracted by the minority leader's opposition to anything and everything, let me comment a little bit on the Gorsuch nomination.  We will meet next week, on April 3, to vote Judge Gorsuch's nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, at which time his nomination will come to the floor. The world had a chance to see--and certainly all of America--during the 20 hours that Judge Gorsuch testified before the Judiciary Committee that he is a superb nominee. He is a person with a brilliant legal mind. He has an incredible educational resume and extensive experience both in the public sector--working at the Department of Justice--and in private practice and then for the last 10 years, of course, serving as a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals out of  I believe he is one of the most qualified nominees in recent history, to be sure, and you might have to go back into our early history to find somebody on par with Judge Gorsuch in terms of his qualifications for this important office. Unfortunately, in spite of this, we are seeing the minority leader threatening to filibuster this incredibly well-qualified judge. I hope other Democrats will exercise independence and do the right thing.  I was glad to see just yesterday our colleague, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Vermont, say that he had a different take. He was quoted in a Vermont newspaper--perhaps it is a blog--it is called VTDigger.org. Senator Leahy, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said: ``I am not inclined to filibuster.''  Just for the benefit of anybody who might be listening, let me distinguish between the use of the filibuster as opposed to voting against the nominee.  It is a fact that there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in American history--never.  The only time cloture was denied on a bipartisan basis of a nominee to the Supreme Court was in 1968, when Abe Fortas was nominated by then-President Lyndon Mr.Fortas, then serving as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, had a number of problems, one of which was that he was still advising President Johnson while he was a sitting member of the U.Supreme He was basically giving political advice from the bench to the President of the United States, with whom he had a long-established relationship.  Then there was a suspicion that Earl Warren, the Chief Justice of the United States, had cut a deal with the President such that he would resign effective upon the qualifying of his successor. So there wasn't any literal vacancy to fill. The President would then nominate Abe Fortas, then an Associate Justice, and he would then nominate Homer Thornberry, then a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, to fill the Fortas Associate Justice slot. There were a couple of embarrassing items to Judge Fortas that caused a bipartisan denial of cloture, or the cutting off of debate, after which his nomination was withdrawn after 4 days of floor debate.  I mention all of this because sometimes people want to lead you down this rabbit trail, claiming that what they are doing is something that is well established in our history and in this precedence of the Senate when that is absolutely not true. There has never been a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee that has been successful in denying that Justice to the Supreme Court's nomination to be confirmed--never. What Democrats are threatening to do next week when[[Page S2020]]Judge Gorsuch's nomination comes to the floor is unprecedented. It has never happened before.  I am glad to hear some voices of sanity and wisdom from people like Senator Leahy, who said he was not inclined to join in that filibuster. I also saw that our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, has said he will not filibuster the nominee. It is totally a separate issue as to whether they vote to confirm the nominee ultimately because, as we all know, in working here in the Senate, in order to get to that up-or-down vote, you have to get past this cloture vote, which requires 60 votes, and it has been traditional that we have not even had those cloture votes with regard to Supreme Court nominations.  As a matter of fact, there have only been four of those in our history. Two of them were with regard to William Rehnquist when nominated as Associate Justice to the Supreme Court and then when he was nominated to be Chief Justice of the Supreme With Samuel Alito, there was cloture obtained. Ultimately, he won an up-or-down vote and got a majority of votes on the Senate floor. Then, of course, there was the Fortas nomination, which I mentioned earlier. In none of those four cases was there a partisan filibuster that denied an up-or-down vote to the nominee. Again, the only one that is a little of an outlier is the Fortas nomination, which was ultimately withdrawn, so the Senate did not have the opportunity to come back and revisit that initial failed cloture vote because of the ethical problems that led Judge Fortas to resign from the Supreme Court and return to private practice.  Let me talk a minute about the excuses our Democratic colleagues have given in opposing Judge  First, they said they would fight a nominee who was not in the mainstream.  I believe that out of the 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has participated in, 97 percent of those have been affirmed on appeal--97 percent. He has only been reversed in maybe one case. I believe there was a discussion about it. There was even an argument as to whether that was an outright reversal. It is very unusual, in my experience, to see a judge who enjoys such a tremendous record of affirmance on appeal and such a very low record of reversal, particularly for an intermediate appellate court like the Tenth Circuit Court of  After they realized this ``out of the mainstream'' argument wouldn't work, they then moved the goalpost. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have implied they might oppose Judge Gorsuch because of his refusal to answer questions about issues that could come before him on the In doing so, the judge was doing exactly what is required by judicial ethics. In other words, how would you feel if the judge before whom you appeared had previously said ``If I get confirmed, I will never vote in favor of a litigant with this kind of case''? Judges do not do that. Judges are not politicians who run for office on a platform. In fact, judges are supposed to be the anti-politician--ruling on the law and the facts. It is not based on a personal agenda or a political agenda at all, and our colleagues know that.  This is the same rule that was embraced by Ruth Bader Ginsburg--someone whom our friends across the aisle admire on the Elena Kagan did the same thing in refusing to comment or speculate, saying that it would be improper for them to prejudge these cases or to campaign, basically, for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch did the same thing as Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, and he fulfilled his ethical obligations as a sitting judge and preserved the independence of the judiciary by keeping an open mind as to cases that come before him.  When they failed to make the case that Judge Gorsuch was somehow out of the mainstream, when they failed to make the case that he somehow was being nonresponsive in his answering questions by the Judiciary Committee, the goalpost moved yet again. Last week, some suggested that Judge Gorsuch never ruled in favor of the ``little guy.'' This was following a line of arguments peddled by some outside groups who were trying to paint Judge Gorsuch as unsympathetic to the litigants who appeared in his court.  Fortunately, Judge Gorsuch set the record straight. He made clear that his motivation in each and every case is to follow the law wherever it may lead and to reach a decision based on where the law stands, not on his personal opinion or emotions. Again, a good judge does not judge the litigants but, rather, the case at hand.  I should point out, as I did with regard to the more than 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has decided, that virtually all of them have been affirmed, meaning that every judge on the panel, including those nominated by Democrats, reached the same conclusion that he did, and they were approved, or affirmed, by the higher court, certainly not reversed.  I think our colleagues are making a tragic mistake by denying this President his nominee for the Supreme Court of the United If Judge Gorsuch is not good enough for them, they will never vote to confirm any nominee from this or any other Republican President of the United What would happen if that view were to prevail? I think we would see the Supreme Court essentially become nonfunctional and shut down, and litigants who were hoping to get access to a hearing before the Court would have nowhere to turn. It is not acceptable.  Some of our colleagues remind me of the old story about the child who murders his parents and then comes before the court and asks for leniency, saying: I am an orphan. This is a situation of their own making.  I really regretted hearing the Democratic leader talk about a case in which somehow there was the argument that because the judge followed the precedent that then existed but that a future decision in a Supreme Court case changed that precedent--that the judge should have anticipated it and somehow failed to follow the current precedent because the Supreme Court at some later date might change that precedent. It makes absolutely no sense.  So what our colleagues are doing is basically saying that no nominee of President Trump's or any Republican nominee is going to get confirmed to the Supreme Court because it is going to require 60 votes to do so. This would be unprecedented in our Nation's history. I think it will be an abuse of the power we have in the Senate of encouraging debate, which is the cloture vote, by filibustering this outstanding nominee.  I have said it before and I will say it again: Judge Gorsuch is going to have his day on the Senate floor. We are going to have a fulsome debate. We are going to give our Democratic colleagues a chance to do the right thing and to vote at some point to cut off debate and then have an up-or-down vote to confirm the nominee, just as has happened in every single case before, with the possible exception of the Fortas nomination, which I described earlier, which was ultimately withdrawn and the judge resigned because of an ethical scandal.  I hate to see our colleagues taking us down this path, but they are determined to oppose anything and everything these days. We used to say there was a difference between campaigning and governing. Basically, they are so upset with the outcome of the election that they are continuing the political campaign now and making it impossible for us to do our work here in the It is a crying shame.  I can only hope that cooler heads will prevail and that others in the Democratic caucus will listen to Senator Leahy and others who say they are not inclined to filibuster. Whether they decide to vote against the nominee is entirely up to them, but denying the majority in the Senate a chance to vote to confirm the nominee is simply unacceptable, and it will not stand.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

925,topic-id,3640,"Mr.President, let me just say while the Senator is on the floor that I express my admiration once again for the distinguished Senator from Utah, who is my good friend and in many ways is a mentor as the chairman of the Senate Finance I am privileged to be a member of that committee and to work with him and, of course, on the Judiciary Committee as well. I thank the Senator in particular for his leadership on this resolution of disapproval, and I support his position 100 percent.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  As we all know now, Mr.President, this Chamber will consider the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Justice on the U.Supreme  Yesterday I spoke a little bit about his qualifications, his background, and his temperament. During the 20 hours of hearings we held before the Judiciary Committee, I think people saw the real Neil Gorsuch--somebody who, again, by virtue of his qualifications, his education, his training, and his experience is supremely qualified to serve on the Supreme He did pass every single test with flying colors, even as my colleagues and some activist groups have done their best to find ways to object to what may be one of the most qualified candidates for the Court in our Nation's history.  One argument we have heard from the opponents of the nominee in 3 days of grueling hearings was that he failed to convey his approach to judging--how he would approach the job. I would like to point out that that is simply not the case. Judge Gorsuch made clear that the text of the statute, the text of the Constitution, and the text of a precedent would guide his judging and would be the place where he starts in deciding any case. As he has repeatedly written and stated publicly, the job of a good judge is to understand what the law means and to interpret what lawmakers have done.  I know some of our colleagues and some of the activist groups who are critical of Judge Gorsuch are upset that he doesn't believe in a living Constitution--in other words, that the Constitution, as written and ratified by the States, does not mean what it says, and that judges have a license to interpret the words in a way to pursue some other purpose, some other agenda, political or personal or the like.  Judge Gorsuch rejects that approach, and rightly so. Indeed, how can a judge claim to bear allegiance to the Constitution if he doesn't actually start in interpreting the Constitution by reading the text of the words? What would a judge decide on if not the text and the original meaning?  To that effect, I received a letter from a friend of mine and an expert in this area, Bryan Garner, last week. Bryan is a well-known lawyer and writer and, among many impressive accomplishments, he is a distinguished research professor of law at Southern[[Page S2060]]Methodist University in Dallas, Bryan has written extensively on judging, appellate advocacy, and the law generally. He was in attendance at the hearings last week. As I said, he has written a number of books, including with Judge Gorsuch, on judicial precedent, and with Justice Scalia, on reading laws.  In a recent letter, Bryan echoed the same point made by both of these men at different times--that adherence to the text is essential to our system of government. He said: ``The very fact of having a written constitution meant that we had fixed its meaning in permanent form.''  Now, that seems so obvious, but, apparently, it is not obvious to some of the critics. He said: ``The very fact of having a written constitution meant that we had fixed its meaning in permanent form.'' In other words, our Constitution is not meant to float on the whims of judges over time, bound only by precedent. It is actually written down, so that even judges have to start with the very text.  If we think about it, there is the independence that we have given to the judiciary--lifetime tenure. They don't have to stand for election, and they are not accountable to the voters or the people. The reason why the Founders created such an important role for the judiciary is because they believed there ought to be an umpire who calls balls and strikes when Congress passes laws or when lawsuits are filed and who could determine the fidelity of those laws to the text of the Constitution, which had a fixed meaning.  Well, sometimes this is called originalism, but it is not a political doctrine or an excuse to get certain outcomes. Mr.Garner makes the point that although his personal politics are different, dramatically, from those of Justice Scalia, those personal politics are irrelevant because the job of a judge is to apply a fair reading of the law. If you can't do that, then, maybe you ought to run for the Senate or Congress and get involved in politics rather than judging, because a failure to apply the law as fairly read is essential in any good judge.  Judges aren't given lifetime tenure--the sort of independence that nobody else in our government is given--just to enact their own visions of policy. Judge Gorsuch confirmed time and again that he will not do that--that he will only interpret the law as he has throughout his career as an independent judge, with faithfulness and fidelity to the text and the original understanding of the  The letter I have been quoting in part is here in my hand, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Now, I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who have indicated that adherence to originalism is a liability or who claim that it is somehow a radical doctrine out of the mainstream, but that is just a scare tactic. It is completely wrong. Let me remind my colleagues that during her confirmation hearings, now-Justice Elena Kagan told the same committee that ``we are all Originalists''--hardly a radical position, if Justice Kagan and Judge Gorsuch agree with originalism. It is certainly not a methodology of interpreting law that should stir any concern.  Yesterday, some of our Democratic colleagues continued to reinforce my view that they don't really have any legitimate objection and reason to filibuster Judge Neil This is about Judge This is not about President This is not about Merrick This is not about anything else.  We will have a chance to vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the U.S Supreme That is the question that will be presented to the Senate for an up-or-down vote. Any fairminded person would have to conclude that he is an independent legal mind and that he will not legislate from the bench. He has the intelligence, experience, and character to be a good judge, as he has been for 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals out of He has an unflinching commitment to upholding a faithful interpretation of the Constitution and our laws. I look forward to confirming him next week.  The question for our Democratic friends is whether they are going to launch the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United It really is unprecedented, what the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, has suggested--that for the first time in the history of the Senate, a partisan filibuster will be used to attempt to defeat the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice and to deny the Senate the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote.  Now, just to be clear, there are two votes we are talking about. One is the so-called cloture vote, where we close off debate. That takes 60 votes. Then, once that passes, it is clearly a majority vote, and 51 votes will carry the day.  But the Democratic leader has suggested that he would deny the Senate the opportunity to get to that second up-or-down vote, and that is simply unprecedented. It is unprecedented for a very good reason. To believe that 60 votes would be required to confirm a nominee to the U.Supreme Court would be to suggest that the Founding Fathers, when the Constitution was written and when it was ratified, somehow believed that the Senate rules were incorporated in the Constitution, when that is clearly not the case--clearly not the case. The Constitution is a separate document. The Senate rules are a different thing. But, again, never have they been conflated to suggest that somehow, in order to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court, we need 60 votes.  I understand the pressure that our friend the Democratic leader is under, because after this last election, he has now had to straddle two competing camps within the Democratic Party--traditional Democrats versus the Democrats lead by the wing of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth I understand the pressures that he must feel and the reason why he would do something that is unprecedented and suggest that we filibuster this nomination.  We already know that some Members of his conference have said they will agree to an up-or-down vote. Our friend from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, has said he opposes the filibuster. Senator Leahy, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said he is not inclined to go along with it, either. Senator Cardin, our colleague and friend from Maryland, has stopped short of agreeing with the minority leader's strategy. Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota has said that she believes the nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.  If the Democratic leader follows through, as I said, it would be unprecedented. Never before has there been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. I would just say to our friends across the aisle that time and again Democrats have accelerated the arms race on judges, and every single time, it has come back to bite them.  We remember in 2013, when Senator Harry Reid, then the majority leader, broke the Senate rules in order to change the rules, in order to lower the threshold for circuit court and district court nominations. He did that because of the desire to pack the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, because that was the court that had primary jurisdiction over cases coming out of the Obama White House--its regulations and the like. In order to get a court that would be more likely to rubberstamp and approve of Obama policies, Senator Reid felt it was imperative to pack the DC Circuit Court of Unfortunately, he was able to do so with the votes of the Democrats across the aisle--to break the Senate rules to change the rules for the sole purpose of rubberstamping Obama administration policies.  The question before the Senate this time is very different. Those who would break precedent are those who would filibuster a Supreme Court nominee like Judge Gorsuch because it has never been done before. But I would ask our Democratic colleagues this: If Judge Gorsuch is not acceptable to them, is there ever going to be a nominee from a Trump administration whom they would find acceptable?  They have tried to find fault with Judge Gorsuch, and they have simply been unable to do so. So they keep moving the goalpost and raising different issues because they, frankly, are desperate to find some reason to justify this unprecedented filibuster.  But if they do--if Democrats block Judge Gorsuch from receiving an up-or-[[Page S2061]]down vote--then, there is simply no Republican nominee to the U.Supreme Court they won't filibuster. If Judge Gorsuch isn't good enough, I dare say there will never be another nominee who is good enough to allow an up-or-down vote if this unprecedented filibuster is allowed to stand.  So I hope our colleagues will reconsider, and that, on cooler reflection, the will not be driven by the radical elements in their own party but rather by their good judgment and their sense of responsibility to not only their constituents but to the Constitution itself and to the important role that the Senate plays in the advice and consent function to the nominee of the U.Supreme I hope they reconsider, and I hope that when the rollcall vote is held, our colleagues will provide the 60 votes we need to get cloture, so we can have that up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    Law Prose,                                       Dallas, TX, March 25, 2017.     Senator John Cornyn,     U.Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington,       Dear Senator Cornyn: It was an eerie feeling for me this      week, sitting behind my friend and coauthor Judge Neil      Gorsuch as he was being vetted to replace my late friend and      coauthor, Justice Antonin As you know, I've written      lengthy books with both men, and I know their legal      philosophies pretty darned well.       One aspect of their approach to judging--``originalism,''      as it's called--has attracted polemicists to use the label as      a scare tactic. So much demagoguery surrounds the word that      some clarification is in order.       People might wonder why Justice Scalia would write a      prescriptive book on judging (Reading Law) with someone who      had declared himself to favor same-sex marriage, to be      ardently pro-choice, to disfavor prayer in public schools,      and to be hostile to the Second Amendment--so hostile, in      fact, that he would like to see it repealed altogether. Yes,      I'd favor serious gun-control measures in this country.       My private beliefs on these points, however, would be      irrelevant if I were up for a judgeship because      methodologically I'm an originalist: I wouldn't be enacting      my own visions of wise policy--that's not what a good judge      does--but instead I'd be applying a ``fair reading'' to the      the statutory or constitutional words before me. Although I      deplore the Second Amendment's right to bear arms, I think      the Supreme Court's Heller decision was correct: the      constitutional Framers meant there to be a personal (though      not unlimited) right to own guns. I wish it weren't so.       Only if I were a ``pragmatist'' judge or a ``changing      constitutionalist'' would these private views become      important. Then I wouldn't be ``interpreting'' a document.      Instead, I'd be declaring new policies that have no      discernible foundation in the Constitution itself. I'd be      looking within my heart and soul to consider what I believed      to be fundamentally important. There I might discover new      rights that people hadn't seen before. I might take on the      mantle of philosopher-king: whenever reformers couldn't get a      constitutional amendment through, they could come to my      court. Perhaps four of my colleagues and I could amend the      Constitution for them: we'd declare a new meaning and find a      new fight as part of our never-ending Constitutional            That's what would happen if I were a ``pragmatist'' (it's a      euphemism) or a ``changing constitutionalist'' (the euphemism      is ``living constitutionalist'').       So you can see why methods of judging have caused the      confirmation process to become so heavily politicized. In      Reading Law, Justice Scalia and I remarked: ``The descent      into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely      traceable to nontextual means of interpretation, which erode      society's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no      agreed-on meaning. Nontextual interpretation, which makes      `statesmen' of judges, promotes the shifting of political      blame from political organs of government (the executive and      the legislature) to the judiciary.''       We went on to observe that ``the consequence is the      politicizing of judges (and hence of the process of selecting      them) and a decline of faith in democratic institutions.''       In a New York Times op-ed two days ago, a law professor      from Louisiana had the temerity to say that ``Justice Scalia      failed to realize that textualism is self-undermining.'' His      support for that slander? ``Nowhere does the Constitution      explicitly state that textualism, no less than originalism or      any other method, is the correct theory of constitutional      interpretation.''       This is just silly. Nowhere in Shakespeare is it said that      future generations may well need a glossary to understand      some of the words--or that the best understanding of the      words will be their Elizabethan understanding. For example,      few people who read the word leasing in Shakespeare would      understand it, as his contemporaries did, to mean ``a lie or      falsehood.''       Although there was no name for originalism in the 18th      century, the idea was well-enough understood. The political      philosopher Emmerich de Vattel--whose influence on Benjamin      Franklin, George Washington, and other Founders was well      known and ``timely,'' according to Franklin, since it reached      them about 1775--wrote in his Law of Nations: ``The      interpretation of every act, and of every treaty, ought . . .      to be made according to certain rules proper to determine the      sense of them, such as the parties concerned must naturally      have understood, when the act was prepared and accepted.''       Vattel added: `When an ancient act is to be interpreted, we      should then know the common use of the terms, at the time      when it was written.''       That was the settled view of written legal instruments,      whether statutes or written constitutions. In 1796, Justice      James Iredell of the Supreme Court wrote: `We are too apt, in      estimating a law passed at a remote period, to combine in our      consideration, all the subsequent events which have had an      influence upon it, instead of confining ourselves (which we      ought to do) to the existing circumstances at the time of its      passing.''       Perhaps, you might think, all these statements relate only      to statutes and not to constitutions. Just seven years later,      in the seminal case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John      Marshall applied the same principle to the U.     He emphasized the notion that the Constitution, aside from      what ought to be infrequent amendment, is fundamental and      unchanging: ``That the people have an original right to      establish, for their future government, such principles as,      in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness,      is the basis, on which the whole American fabric has been      erected.'' It's an original right to fix the future      government. He added that this original right is ``a very      great exertion'' that should not ``be frequently repeated.''      Then, in this closely reasoned passage, he says that ``the      principles . . . so established are deemed fundamental'' and      ``are designed to be permanent.''       Permanent--not waxing and waning according to political      expediencies of the moment.       That's the essence of originalism. Marshall and Iredell and      Vattel were hardly alone. Other writers of the period agreed.      In 1821, James Madison, one of the architects of the      Constitution and author of the Bill of Rights, correctly      stated the gist of originalism: ``Can it be of less      consequence that the meaning of a constitution should be      fixed and known, than that the meaning of a law should be so?      Can, indeed, a law be fixed in its meaning and operation,      unless the constitution be so?''       Elsewhere, Madison wrote: ``What a metamorphosis would be      produced in the Code of the law if all its ancient      phraseology were to be taken in its modern sense.'' He      further insisted that if ``the sense in which the      Constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation . . . be      not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for      a faithful exercise of its powers.''       The very fact of having a written constitution meant that      we had fixed its meaning in permanent form. That wasn't just      the prevalent notion among the founders--it was the only      notion of which any contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous      trace can be found.       Some imprecise observers confuse the concept of originalism      with the word originalism--and so conclude that the concept,      like the word, was born ``in 1985 [when] Ronald Reagan's      attorney general at the time, Edwin Meese, elevated      originalism to a legal and political movement.'' It may well      be that the term originalism didn't come into common usage      until the 1980s, but that is simply because before then there      was no need for the term. Originalism is what philologists      call a ``retronym''--a term devised to describe what used to      be an entire genus but has since become merely one species of      the genus. For example, the term land line didn't exist in      the telecommunications field until wireless technology was      invented. Until then, all voice telecommunication was through      land lines, so the term was unnecessary.       Likewise, giving text its original meaning was long the      standard legal practice. It wasn't until the 1960s that other      ``theories'' of interpretation came into common usage. Only      then did it become necessary to coin a word to denote the      traditional practice.       Only by sheer, bald-faced casuistry can it be argued, as it      was earlier this week in the New York Times, that ``true      originalism--genuinely following the founders' intent--     requires us moderns to interpret constitutional language in      light of our own, not their, moral and linguistic norms.''      This assertion comes, of course, from the same writer who      asserts that ``Justice Scalia also failed to realize--or at      least admit--that textualism and originalism rarely determine      a unique outcome.''       These calumnies don't square with the facts. In the preface      to Reading Law, Justice Scalia and I plainly wrote:      ``Textualism will not relieve judges of all doubts and      misgivings about their interpretations. Judging is inherently      difficult, and language notoriously slippery. But textualism      will provide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater      predictability and greater respect for the rule of law.''       Judge Gorsuch said as much during his Judiciary Committee      hearings this week. He demonstrated an astonishing command of      the law, a erudition worn lightly, a calm but tenacious      dedication to the scruple of judicial ethics, a thoroughly      likable demeanor,[[Page S2062]]     and admirable endurance.

933,topic-id,910,"Mr.President, I returned last week from the Middle East, where several colleagues and I spent the weekend meeting with leaders and security officials in Lebanon, Jordan, and As usual, the men and women who assisted us were consummate professionals, whether it was the U.Marines, Embassy personnel, or our own military escorts and congressional staff. They all did a superb job, and I want to extend to them my deepest thanks. I want to say a few words about what we learned while we were there.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, our allies told us they are more optimistic about their relationship with the United States now than they were under the last administration. If you thought diplomacy consisted simply of suave sophistication, I can understand your confusion. But among our allies, there is no confusion about what their interests are, how the United States shares them, and which country in the whole region threatens them most of all--Once you realize that, it is not so hard to understand their morale boost. Do they watch what we say? Yes, of course, very carefully. But they watch even more carefully what we do, and even though our foreign policy was cloaked in ``pretty words'' over the last 8 years, they see the difference in leadership as clear as day. The last President coddled Iran, and this President is confronting  Every conversation we had drove home this point: Iran is the single most destabilizing force in the Middle That is because it is more than a regional power, it is a revolutionary power. The regime in Tehran is not satisfied with finding good trading partners or even bullying other countries into proper neighborly deference. Big countries throw their weight around all the time, after all. No, what is different about this regime is that it is not trying to create clients; it is trying to create clones. It wants to expand its influence by subverting legitimate governments in places such as Yemen and Lebanon and replacing them with radical regimes. Countries that it can't subvert, it tries to destroy, like our friend And its aggressive sectarian ideology drives Sunni Muslims into the arms of extremist groups like the Islamic  There is no getting around the fact that in the Middle East, the answer to most questions is Iran, and our allies have told me repeatedly in recent months that they need our help to confront Tehran's campaign of imperial aggression.  In Lebanon, I am happy to say there are some signs of hope. The new Prime Minister, Sa'ad Hariri, has formed a government and is purportedly on the verge of approving a budget--the first of its kind since 2005. For years, the Lebanese Government has struggled with the growing influence of Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, members of which are on trial for carrying out the assassination of the Prime Minister's father, Rafic, in 2005. But now that Hezbollah is committed to the war in Syria, the Lebanese Government has an opportunity to take control of its border, its army, and its governing institutions, free of their terrorist influence. We should take all prudent steps to support Lebanon as it strives to create security and stability for its own people and its neighbors.  Then there is Jordan, which for so long has been a relative island of calm in a tumultuous region. The Hashemite monarchy has been a faithful friend to America for years, but now, for the first time in recent history, Jordan faces a hostile, aggressive power on its borders--It is also under an immense strain as it deals with hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees living in its territory. Today, Jordan spends up to 25 percent of its budget on helping refugees. We need to continue helping this bulwark of stability stand against the forces of Islamic extremism by sharing intelligence, helping train police and counterterrorism forces, and partnering in the fight against  Finally, there is Israel, which it is no secret that the regime in Tehran has vowed to destroy. While we were overseas, Israeli warplanes struck deep into the heart of Syrian territory. They were targeting a convoy of advanced missiles bound for In a serious escalation, Syria fired missiles not[[Page S2068]]only at Israeli aircraft but at Israeli territory, one of which was intercepted by the Arrow 2 missile defense system.

We must continue to support Israel and its development of advanced missile defense systems.

1218,topic-id,595,"Mr.President, when his nomination comes to the floor next week, I will vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme This is my first time voting on a Supreme Court nominee, and I don't take the decision lightly. It is a lifetime appointment, after all, and the Court's rulings have shaped our country's history--for good and for ill--and will continue to shape our future. But after reading Judge Gorsuch's writings, meeting with him in person, and listening to his testimony, I can say with confidence that it is not a hard call. I believe Judge Gorsuch will be a fine addition to the Supreme  There is no denying Judge Gorsuch's distinctive qualifications. We all know his credentials: Columbia, Harvard law, and an Oxford doctorate to boot. He clerked for an appellate judge and two Supreme Court He had many years of experience in both private practice and in public service and, of course, over 10 years as an appellate judge. He possesses fine judicial temperament: highly erudite, highly accomplished, and highly regarded by those who know him best. It is no surprise, then, that the American Bar Association, in a unanimous vote, declared him ``well qualified'' for the job.  While I wouldn't outsource our responsibilities to any advocacy organization, I would note that the minority leader himself once said the ABA rating is ``the gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''  But, of course, Judge Gorsuch is not just filling any seat, but the seat once held by the late Justice Antonin Justice Scalia was a giant of American jurisprudence. Most Justices earn their place in history by writing opinions, giving voice to their colleagues, and speaking for the Court as a whole. Justice Scalia did that many times throughout his career, of course, but he did something more. He changed the way judges--both conservative and liberal--think about the law and defend their decisions. He reminded us all that a judge's job is to apply the law--including the Constitution, our most fundamental law--as written, to the case before him, not to rewrite it all together.  Adhering to the law, even when the judge doesn't like the result, is the greatest public service that a judge can render, because to respect the rule of law is ultimately to respect the rule of the people.  This is what Justice Scalia taught and what he inspired a whole generation of judges and lawyers to understand. As we prepare to fill his seat on the Supreme Court, let us also acknowledge that no man can fill his shoes. We honor the memory of Justice Scalia and we thank his wife, Maureen, and his whole family for sharing this great man with our country for so long.  Judge Gorsuch is a child of the Scalia generation. He has long advocated for and followed the originalist judicial craft--one rooted in the text, structure, and history of our Constitution, which is to say that he respects the rule of law and he respects the people. Whether defending the religious liberty of the Little Sisters of the Poor or the Fourth Amendment rights of a regular household, he has shown a profound respect for the I also think he has demonstrated throughout his career a firm independence of thought. He has had his influences and his mentors, his promoters and his critics, but I believe he will be his own man--as he should be.  So I am pleased to announce my support for the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Neil I look forward to his confirmation next week.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2139.txt,2098,NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE,2017.0,30.0,March

938,topic-id,2836,"Madam President, I rise today to speak about the President's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Whenever great issues like the future of our Nation's highest Court come before the Senate, it is easy to get lost in the noise and the hyperbole. Listening to the commentary about Judge Gorsuch, I have found it instructive to ask whether critics have actually met him and listened to his philosophy of jurisprudence.  I have met him, and it is easy to guess that those who oppose him likely have not spoken to him, watched the hearings, or read any of the glowing testimonials from across the political spectrum. The invectives thrown at Judge Gorsuch seem really to be about something else entirely--about anger at the President, disappointment with the election outcome, or concern about holding certain hotly debated topics of the day. It appears that critics could substitute almost any name for Judge Gorsuch in their statements and give them with the same passion and the same concern.  That is too bad because Judge Gorsuch has been consistently regarded by his peers as pragmatic and among the most gifted legal minds on the Federal bench. The man is intelligent, courteous, and modest. He seeks readily the views of those around him. His approach will be a constructive addition to the U.Supreme Court and of benefit to our His judicial record as a Federal judge flows exactly from what he says, and his message and focus is abundantly clear: judicial modesty and fidelity to the law.  When our representative government was established in the United States, a heated debate emerged about the purposes and powers of our new Federal institutions. The Founders of our country understood that a system in which lawmaking was detached from accountability was the quickest path to despotism. A coequal judiciary could help temper tyranny and balance the powers of an executive and a legislature stepping over their constitutional powers. The phrase is ``checks and balances'' not ``usurpation.''  Alexander Hamilton, who has received much recently renewed attention, wrote at length about the newly imagined judicial branch of our government. In Federalist 78, Hamilton wrote that the judicial branch ``may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.''  To the Founders, the division of responsibilities between the three branches of government was clear: Congress would make the laws. The executive would implement them. The judiciary would review the laws for their legality and consistency with the Further, the independence of the judiciary would be enhanced through their distinctive selection process, so they could do their jobs without succumbing to swings in popular opinion. Put succinctly by Chief Justice Roberts during his confirmation hearings, a judge's proper role is ``to call balls and strikes.''  In his testimonial to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Gorsuch emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary. He writes:       Judges should . . . strive to apply the law as it is,      focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text,      structure, and history . . . not decide cases on their own      moral convictions.  Judges ``take an oath to uphold'' the Constitution, not ``merely consider it.'' It is their duty to follow the law.  Jurisprudence is not supposed to be the popular arts. Judges are not vessels for moral causes. Judge Gorsuch repeats Justice Scalia's words:       [I]f you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have      to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going      to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the      time, you're probably doing something wrong.  Further, Judge Gorsuch states that rulings made in an attempt to optimize social utility introduces a question of moral relativism.       In criminal cases, for example, we often hear arguments      from the government that its view would promote public      security or finality. Meanwhile, the defense often tells us      that its view would promote personal liberty or procedural      fairness. How is a judge supposed to weigh or rank these very      different social goods?  The answer lies in the common points of reference for all judges, be they conservatives or progressives--the written law. Reading the law is difficult enough without introducing the element of uncertainty. Court-shopping for a pliant judge who will interpret the law the way a litigant believes it should read can be destructive to public confidence in the legal system.  In our democracy, the public expresses its will at the ballot box and empowers its duly-elected officials with the duty to advance that will. Changes in public attitudes can come quickly, and that can be reflected in the results of elections.  Congress is the body most closely connected to the American public because its accountability is directly to the people.  Some observers want judges to be legislators, discarding the black robes for populist impulses. But our system of checks and balances is predicated on the fact that change comes deliberately and incrementally, notwithstanding the wild swings in public mood.  The pace of change can understandably frustrate. However, congressional action is the spirit of the American electorate, exercised with its unique combination of majority rule, minority rights, and compromise. The imperfect caldron of the legislative process is how change happens carefully, purposefully, and properly.  Unfortunately, impatience can drive people to try to circumvent the constitutional power of The tendency of some to race to a courthouse, bypassing the will of the people expressed through Congress, to compel change is inherently destabilizing to representative government.  Without a direct say in how policy is decided and without the ability to hold people accountable, judges who reimagine the law undermine a fundamental cornerstone of representative democracy. Judges have a great responsibility to carefully exercise their judicial authority within the limits of the law. Judges who exercise independence from anchors of our law are dangerous to our liberties. Judge Gorsuch demonstrates that he clearly understands this concept when he writes:       Legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and      to claims to reshape the law as they think it should be in      the future. But judges should do none of these things in a      democratic society.  Some jurists treat the Constitution like a speed bump as they hurdle down the road reinventing the law. Substituting ideology for the written law in jurisprudence is the equivalent of changing the law from what it says to what some wish it says.  Neil Gorsuch identified this very problem when he wrote in 2005 that ``the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. In the legislative arena, especially when the country is closely divided, compromises tend to be the rule of the day. But when judges rule this or that policy unconstitutional, there's little room for compromise: One side must win, the other must lose. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and the flexibility of social experimentation that only the elected branches can provide.'' These words reflect a clear understanding of the importance of the separation of powers.  The Federal judiciary should not be a replacement for doing the hard work of persuading the public and enacting policy with accountability to the electorate.[[Page S2072]]  Americans learn civics early in their upbringing. The Constitution guarantees certain civil liberties and restrains the powers of the central government. Our court system has the responsibility to preserve our constitutional rights, ensure a limited government, and provide speedy and fair justice when needed. The judiciary holds the sole constitutional power to interpret laws properly enacted by This authority is expressly distinct from the power bestowed to the legislature to write laws and the executive to enforce them. This separation of powers plays an important role in the system of checks and balances envisioned by the  Public confidence in our legal system is undermined when judges seek to reimagine Federal law beyond its clear meaning. Judges who substitute their personal views for the law can shake the public's faith in our legal system as an impartial protector of our rights and an upholder of justice. Judges must follow our Constitution in their decisionmaking and resist this temptation to make policy.  Moreover, without the public sanction of the ballot box, policy changes, particularly controversial ones, naturally divide people. If the judiciary cannot be seen as a neutral arbiter of facts and laws, even more people will see individual judges as ``one of mine'' or ``one of yours.''  The erosion of the humble judiciary began when the Senate confirmation process changed. In recent past, district and circuit court nominees used to be confirmed noncontroversially. Now, instead of looking at the qualifications of the judicial nominee, partisans hope to pre-bake court decisions through the use of litmus tests or demands on nominees to determine in advance what their rulings will be on cases before the matter is even argued to the court. Perhaps this is the logical extension of the overreliance on some to secure social gains they cannot achieve through the democratic process.  Change is hard, and patience is exceedingly rare, but the strongest building blocks to legitimacy are achieved though consensus and the give-and-take of politics.  Writing even before he was overwhelmingly approved by this body for his current seat on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch wrote:       [In courts,] ideas are tested only in the abstract world of      legal briefs and lawyers' arguments. As a society, we lose      the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and      the flexibility of social experimentation that only the      elected branches can provide. At the same time, the      politicalization of the judiciary undermines the only real      asset it has--its independence. Judges come to be seen as      politicians and their confirmations become just an avenue of      political warfare. Respect for the role of judges and the      legitimacy of the judiciary branch as a whole diminishes.       The judiciary's diminishing claim to neutrality and      independence is exemplified by a recent, historic shift in      the Senate's confirmation process. Where trial-court and      appeals-court nominees were once routinely confirmed on voice      vote--  Based on their credentials and their ability to serve--     they are now routinely subjected to ideological litmus tests,      filibusters, and vicious interest-group attacks. It is a      warning sign that our judiciary is losing its legitimacy when      trial and circuit-court judges are viewed and treated as      little more than politicians with robes.  This development puts a severe strain on our Particularly problematic is the increasing number of split court decisions. Rulings that are given with a one-vote margin further empower litigants to contest decisions, hoping for a more favorable outcome later or in a different court. Setting precedent, though, becomes so much more difficult for the public when a razor-thin decision is accompanied by a dramatic reinterpretation of the law.  One of the hallmarks of the Roberts Court is the drive to establish precedent not by finding the narrowest reading that can achieve a bare majority but its endeavor to ground seminal decisions in large majorities and unanimous findings. Public confidence in the legal system and the finality of the holding is ever greater when we do not see narrow decisions.  The Judiciary Committee just concluded a 4-day review of the nomination of Judge In addition to hearing from Judge Gorsuch for over 20 hours, the committee received formal testimony from almost 30 outside witnesses. Thousands upon thousands of words were exchanged over the course of the hearing, all in front of the American public. What the people saw is a thoughtful, humble, and brilliant legal mind in the service of the people.  In response to a question of mine on Tuesday, Judge Gorsuch said the following:       I come here with no agenda but one, no promises but one: to      be as good and faithful a judge as I know how to be. That is      it. And I cannot promise or agree or pledge anything more      than that to this  That statement and the hearing as a whole confirmed Judge Gorsuch to be a man of great integrity, a mainstream, exemplary student of the law whose record shows that he is a part of unanimous decisions. On the Tenth Circuit, of all the decisions he has participated in in the last 10 years, 97 percent of the time, he was a part of a unanimous court, and 99 percent of the time, he was in the majority.  For days, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle raised the possibility that he might have secret intentions to try to subvert the law or shred the Constitution from the bench. They parsed single words for hidden meanings, imagined devious strategies emerging from concurring opinions, and searched for cloaked messages in his published writings.  Judge Gorsuch has over 10 years as a jurist, with 2,700 opinions to review; yet most of the debate was centered on just 4 or 5 cases. Some Senators were absolutely convinced they would find some problem. They did not.  Let's talk about what Judge Gorsuch testified to under oath. Despite repeated efforts to get him to make commitments about how he would rule or how he would reshape social policy, on his first day, he gave no fewer than eight assurances that he follows the law as a judge. By my count, on the second day, he gave at least 36 assurances that he looks to the law for his rulings. On the third day, it was 29 more times that he was asked and again repeated that he would look to the law for his rulings. That is right. He said at least 73 times that he is committed to the law when he hears a case as a sitting Federal judge. Still, several of my colleagues worried that he had a secret agenda to overturn longstanding legal precedence.  Just in case there are some confused, Judge Gorsuch mentioned no fewer than 97 times in these 3 days that he follows precedent as a judge, as he is bound to do. More than 160 times, Judge Gorsuch reminded the Senate and the American public what a proper jurist does: follows the law and the precedent. We even talked about the book he coauthored titled ``The Law of Judicial Precedent''--942 pages of dedication to following precedent. Maybe the title of the book was confusing to some.  During his oral testimony, he said he was dedicated to ``rul[ing] as the law requires,'' ``reading the language of the statute as a `reasonable person' would understand it,'' and ``respect[ing] precedent.''  Just to put all such questions to rest, he assured everyone that he is ``without secret agenda. None.''  In reviewing his record, it is clear that those who come before Judge Gorsuch receive equal treatment under the law. He said:       When I sit on the bench and someone comes to argue before      me, I treat each one of them equally. They do not come as      rich or poor, big guy or little guy. They come as a person.      And I put my ego aside when I put on that robe, and I open my      mind, and I open my heart, and I listen.  In Judge Gorsuch, we have a nominee who lives the American ideal of a modest jurist. He understands that his responsibility is not to suborn the powers of others but to help deliver the powers of justice.  Those who have encountered him as a legal advocate, an adversary in court, or a presiding judge all praise his fundamental fairness and subornation of his personal views.  His respect for the Constitution is not in question. His experience, wisdom, and judgment are not in question. His capability to serve is not in question. Commentators from both the left and the right overwhelmingly respect his legal mind and vouch for his commitment to fair jurisprudence.  Given Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and his record as a judge, he[[Page S2073]]would be a welcome addition to a Supreme Court seeking cohesive decisions. His record on the Tenth Circuit is strong. Five of six of his decisions that did go to the Supreme Court for a review have been affirmed by the Supreme Court, including one which he wrote, and four out of five on which he joined the decision.  Not many judges have the experience, temperament, and stellar record to match Judge Fewer still can garner overwhelming endorsement from colleagues, peers, and observers from across the political spectrum.  Some may try to distract from the central point that Judge Gorsuch is extraordinarily qualified and suited to serve as an Associate Others would like to discuss other issues or make his nomination a proxy fight about tangential matters. My colleagues and I will vote on his nomination, not on these other issues or distractions. I encourage all of us to remember that.

Jenny is a wonderful example of a local leader who is always willing to take on additional responsibility and devote her time and talent to others.  Jenny graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in sociology. At her graduation in Missoula, one of the soldiers in the honor guard escorting the national flag caught her attention. With that chance encounter as the spark, the two were married about a year later. The young couple settled near Helena, in Montana City, where today they are raising their four children. In Helena, Jenny became very active in the Mothers of Preschoolers, also known as MOPS, by serving initially as the director of hospitality, and then after a period of rapid growth, she graciously took on additional duties as the president of a newly formed MOPS group. Jenny served in this capacity for nearly 8 years.[[Page S2150]]  A few years ago, Jenny passed on her MOPS leadership baton and began serving as the chairperson for the education program in her church.

620,topic-id,926,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to address this body, and I rise today to talk about H.1469, the Welfare BRAC  Before going into the specifics of the bill, I would like to talk for a little bit about how we have arrived at a point of needing such a fundamental restructuring of our Nation's antipoverty programs.  In 2015, the Federal Government spent $843 billion on welfare programs, means-tested welfare programs. By some estimates, we have spent more than $22 trillion on antipoverty programs over the past 50 years. Today, we have some 92 antipoverty programs run[[Page H2511]]by the Federal Government, all supposedly with the same goal: to alleviate poverty.  This chart to my left highlights those programs. If you look: 5, cash aid; 25, education and training; 2, for energy; 17, for food aid, and on goes the list.  So how did we come here? Well, as Ronald Reagan said: ``Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this Earth.''  Why is that true? Well, it is true because touching some of these programs is very polarizing. So when you touch them, they all have a constituency. And the reality is, if the 15th food aid program worked well, then the 16th wouldn't be launched. So if you want to address a new problem, well, then you launch the 17th food aid program.  What doesn't happen over the time is finding a way to get those programs to work together to be a coherent whole. So the solution, really in a lot of ways, is bipartisan. The Brookings Institution is rarely an ally to conservatives, and the Heritage Foundation is rarely an ally to the left. Yet they would both agree that employment, healthy marriages, and education alleviate poverty.  In fact, many of our programs, when we look at these listed, seek to address those needs. There are 92 programs. Maslow, in the hierarchy of needs, just addressed 5, and we have 92.  I think about the young social worker who wants to help someone who comes into the office and perhaps each of these programs has a 4-inch binder--a 4-inch thick binder, 92 of them. That is a pretty big bookshelf. What if she only had to know 20 programs? What if there were only 20 binders? What if there were only 5? What if there were 10?  I don't know whether the right number is a dozen or 20, but I don't think it is 92. So what is the solution? Well, I have a bipartisan solution that looks back to the history.  So in the Cold War, we had a very large Army, and, as we scaled down, it was very politically sensitive to try to deal with the problems of scaling down. Each base, each installation, had its own constituency, and so we created BRAC, the Base Closure and Realignment And the goal there was to have a quantitative set of objectives and to have a commission that was bipartisan that gave Congress a straight up-or-down vote. That worked, by and large, and we were able to scale down the military in a way that let the military focus on its mission.  So what I propose with H.1469, the Welfare Benefit Realignment Commission, is a four-Republican, four-Democrat commission, totally neutral. It also does not seek to take away a dime of spending in it. It seeks to reduce the number of programs so that the result is more focused.  When Lyndon Johnson launched his war on poverty, he said that the goal was to not just treat the symptoms but to find a cure and, if possible, to prevent poverty all together.  So perhaps if we had a more focused effort, perhaps if we all focused on the cause, instead of the programs, we could see results. Some of these programs are clearly more effective than others at helping people get out of poverty, yet the reality is, Americans have seen roughly the same percentage of their fellow Americans in poverty for the entire war on poverty.  So if we look at these programs under the same three goals--employment, marriage, and education--perhaps we can find things that are effective that lift people out, really, at the end of the day, giving as many people as possible the dignity of work and a path to escape poverty into a better future.  In fact, this path is very compatible with the Better Way agenda that we have laid out for poverty for the years. It is not focused on dollars. It is focused on efficiency. Later in the year, we are seeking to provide off ramps so that you don't find a trap in the ``Better Way.'' You don't find a trap--if you get a raise, you lose your housing, or if you take that next job, or you get married, you lose your education benefits, things that would provide an on-ramp and an off-ramp for this system.  So that is part of the agenda for the year for the I think this is very compatible with it. I am seeking cosponsors. I am seeking support for this bill, and it truly is with a spirit of embracing the common American value of providing a safety net for their fellow Americans, but they want it to be effective.  So this is not about the cause. The cause is good, and fewer programs lets it be more focused and, hopefully, get a good result.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this.

327,topic-id,574,"Mr.Speaker, I also rise tonight to talk about America First, the proposed budget of the 45th President of the United States, President Donald  It has been said that a budget of a local, State, Federal Government, corporation, nonprofit organization, small business, even a personal budget, really defines one's priorities, one's values, one's vision for the future. The proposed budget gives us a look into one's vision, our President's, for the future of  When I think about a vision for the future of America, I personally think of a vision that exceeds our wildest expectations. This is a vision where every boy and girl, regardless of the color of their skin, their gender, their religion, sexual orientation, where they live or how much money their parents have in the bank, has an opportunity to succeed, particularly in this country that we say is the greatest country in the world, and I do believe it to be so.  There is a famous Scripture that says: Because of a lack of a vision, the people perish.  I ask the question tonight: What is the vision for America under this budget?  My colleague has so eloquently laid out that education truly is the key. It starts in education for higher learning. But what about secondary education, where every child should have an opportunity to receive quality education?  We know that the budget proposed in America First cuts very necessary important programs that particularly hit the State of Florida, for example, the Teacher Quality Partnership, and Impact Aid support payments for Federal property, and international education programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers supports before- and after-school programs where children are able to receive tutoring, learn about the arts and music, and receive a meal during those programs.  Florida would be particularly hurt. Those programs are designed particularly for children that come from at-risk and poverty-stricken areas.  In those before-school and after-school programs, there is a focus on reading and math. And those programs often offer literary services to families of children that participate in those programs.  So back to the gentleman from Texas' question about what do we have to lose? In Florida, the overall graduation rate is 80 percent. But for African Americans, the graduation rate is about 72 percent, and lower for African-American boys. I can tell you, it is the lowest group.[[Page H2458]]  We can't afford to pull more resources from the Department of Education--a proposed budget cut of 13.5 percent, in the double digits--resources that have been dedicated to lifting up all children, but particularly children of color and children from low-income neighborhoods. In President Trump's budget, that 13.5 percent is about $9.2 billion from education.  What is being cut?  Not only the programs that I named, but about 20 other programs: $3.7 billion in grants for teacher training to make sure that children not only receive the best education that money can buy, but also have the best, most qualified, most prepared, most trained teachers. Programs aimed at helping to ensure vulnerable children in low-income neighborhoods are able to succeed. They, too, really deserve a fair shot.  These Federal programs were created to ensure that every child, no matter who they are, has access to education.  This budget cut completely eliminates Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity The name alone says it all, opportunity grants, grants that could offer need-based aid to around 1.6 million low-income undergraduates every year.

After falsely promising that there would be coverage for everyone for less and better, TrumpCare only cares about huge tax breaks for the superrich and special interests, like[[Page H2428]]the totally unjustified $28 billion windfall for the pharmaceutical industry that they grab right out of the Medicare trust fund so that premiums will go up. Those earning $1 million within a single year get 79 percent of a $230 billion tax break, but there is no genuine relief for middle class taxpayers.  Removing the essential health benefits provisions will only enable insurers to exclude the very healthcare protections that folks thought they were getting when they paid their premiums. Insurance plans will not just be skinny, they will be a sham; a provision that at the very time you need the care, it won't be there.

For millions of people who are just a few years too young to qualify for Medicare, their premiums will go through the roof. It will cost thousands of dollars more in order to get insurance.

But, mostly, they don't seem to care how many millions of people lose their health insurance.  Mr.President, this is not the art of the deal.

Senator Bayh was an accomplished lawyer, legislator, and the only non-Founding Father to draft two amendments to the U.Constitution that were enacted.  February 2017 marked the 50th anniversary of the ratification of the 25th Amendment to the The 25th Amendment created an orderly transition of power in the case of death or disability of the President and a method of selecting a Vice President when a vacancy occurs in that office. Before its passage, our Nation experienced several occasions when the President was unable to perform his powers and duties, with no constitutional provision for temporary transfer of these powers to the Vice The amendment was first relied upon following the resignations of Vice President Spiro Agnew and President Richard It also provided the basis for President Ronald Reagan to temporarily pass his duties to Vice President George Bush when President Reagan underwent surgery.  While we all hope not to have to use the 25th Amendment, having an established process that continues to guide administrations faced with unexpected events is essential for any functional democracy. Senator Bayh played a key leadership role in the Senate by drafting this constitutional amendment and ensuring all necessary steps were taken for its ratification in 1967.  Senator Bayh also drafted the 26th Amendment, which changed the voting age from 21 to 18. Its impetus was the passage of amendments to the Voting Rights Act in 1970 that set 18 as the minimum voting age for both Federal and State elections. When the Supreme Court ruled in Oregon v. Mitchell that the law applied only to Federal, not State elections, Congress adopted the 26th Just over 3 months later, on July 1, 1971, three-fourths of the States had ratified the amendment, making it the quickest amendment ever to be adopted.  In addition to these two constitutional amendments, Senator Bayh wrote the landmark title IX to the Higher Education Act, which mandates equal opportunities for women students and faculty. Senator Bayh was also an architect of the Juvenile Justice Act of 1974, which requires the separation of juvenile offenders from adult prison populations, and he played a vital role in the drafting and passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights  Since leaving the Senate in 1980, Senator Bayh has committed himself to leadership in civic policy. He has served as chairman of the University of Virginia's Miller Center Commission on Presidential Disability and the 25th Amendment and as a member of the center's Commission on Federal Judicial He is also founding chairman of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, a nonprofit, first-of-its-kind organization dedicated to studying prejudice and hate crimes in  Senator Bayh, as you and your wife, Kitty, enjoy your retirement, the contributions you have made to our country endure.

1194,topic-id,468,"Mr.President, this vote to allow States to defund Planned Parenthood and other title X funded health programs is simply shameful and dangerous, and millions of Americans across this country, including tens of thousands of women and men in Illinois, are going to suffer as a result.  This vote is particularly devastating to the 2.7 million Americans who depend on Planned Parenthood for their basic preventive healthcare each year. I personally understand what is at stake with this vote because I have been there. When I was working my way through college as a waitress, with the help of Pell grants and student loans and student work-study, I relied on Planned Parenthood for my basic healthcare, for services that are just as simple as a simple physical that I needed to get that waitressing job. I went to Planned Parenthood because that is all I could afford on a student's budget, and I needed to get that second job.  While I can relate to the obvious good that Planned Parenthood does, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, unfortunately, simply cannot. They don't understand what is at stake.  Let's take a look at my home State of In Illinois alone, Planned Parenthood serves 64,000 patients annually. Of those, 34,000 seek testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and nearly 7,000 are seeking out cancer screenings. So by defunding this organization, what they are really doing is stripping thousands of Illinoisans and Americans all across this country from access to essential healthcare. That is simply unacceptable.  We can't play politics with women's healthcare. Planned Parenthood should be able to do its job and continue providing quality care and services without fear of partisan or discriminatory attacks.  The bottom line is that Planned Parenthood is one of the Nation's largest women's healthcare providers, and it is essential to the health of our families and our country.  This vote makes taking away not just Planned Parenthood's funding but funding from any organization that receives title X easier, turning women around the country into second-class citizens and harming millions of Americans in the process. Why would we make it easier to take away a health center that helps our women's public health system and serves as a lifeline for affordable, preventive services like physicals, disease testing, and cancer screenings? Women and men all over the country need these services. Our States and our local communities need these services because they meet a need that would otherwise not be met.

678,topic-id,2300,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme  It is important to reflect for a moment on how we have reached this moment. It has been more than a year since the untimely passing of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016. Under article II, section 2 of the U.Constitution, President Barack Obama had a duty to make a nomination to fill that vacant seat. He met that obligation by nominating Chief Judge Merrick Garland in March of 2016.  Yet the leader of the Senate Republicans, Majority Leader McConnell, announced that, for the first time in the 230-year history of the Senate, he would refuse the President's nominee, Judge Garland, a hearing and a vote. Senator McConnell further said that he would refuse to even meet with Judge It was a transparent political decision made by the Republican leader in the hopes that a Republican would be elected President and fill the vacancy. It was part of a broader Republican political strategy to influence, if not capture, the judicial branch of government on every level of the court system.  Not only did the Senate Republicans keep a Supreme Court seat vacant for over a year, they turned the Senate's Executive Calendar into a nomination obituary column for 30 other judicial nominees who had been reported out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. They were hoping a Republican President would fill all of those seats, and they were prepared to leave them vacant for a year or more to achieve that end.  What kind of nominees were they hoping for? Nominees who had been blessed by special interests, by big business, and by Republican advocacy organizations.  It was last year that then-Candidate Donald Trump released a list of 21 potential Supreme Court candidates who were handpicked by two Republican advocacy groups--the Federalist Society and the Heritage I am not speculating on the fact that they were chosen by those two groups, as President Trump publicly thanked the groups for giving him a list of names with which to fill the vacancies on the Supreme It was unprecedented for anyone, including a candidate for President, to outsource the judicial selection process to special interest[[Page S2024]]groups, but President Trump did it. True to his word to these special interest groups, he nominated one of the names on the list--Judge Neil  The first telephone call Judge Gorsuch received about his nomination was not from the White House; it was from the Federalist Society, which was one of these Republican advocacy groups. Eventually, Judge Gorsuch made it to the interview stage with President Trump's inner circle. He met with Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and President Trump himself. Those men each took the measure of Judge Gorsuch and gave him their approval to serve for a lifetime appointment on the highest Court in the land. President Trump, who had announced numerous litmus tests for judicial nominations, appeared very satisfied with Neil Gorsuch as his nominee.  The President's Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, even said: ``Neil Gorsuch . . . represents the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump.''  There was certainly no political subtlety in that evaluation.  After Judge Gorsuch's nomination was announced, a dark money machine shifted into gear. A national campaign, which cost at least $10 million, was launched to support the Gorsuch nomination. Because it is dark money, there is no disclosure about who is bankrolling this effort, but it is a safe bet that the suppliers of dark money have at least a passing interest in cases before the U.Supreme  Despite this unprecedented and unsettling process that led to Judge Gorsuch's nomination, the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee gave Judge Gorsuch a courtesy that Republicans denied to Judge Garland--a hearing and a vote. Why? Because Senate Democrats take the Constitution seriously. We do not turn our backs on the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent, even though that is exactly what our Republican colleagues did when it came to Merrick  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee met for 4 days to consider the Gorsuch nomination. In leading up to the hearing, I made it clear on the Senate floor that I thought that Judge Gorsuch had a burden to bear at that hearing.  On February 2, I said here on the floor that Judge Gorsuch needed to demonstrate that he would be a nominee who would uphold and defend the Constitution for the benefit of everyone, not just for the advantage of a privileged few who happened to engineer his nomination.  I also said that Judge Gorsuch needed to be forthright with the American people about his record and his views. I made it clear that avoiding answers to critical questions was unacceptable.  I said that he needed to demonstrate that he would be an independent check on President Trump and every President and that he was prepared to disappoint the President and the rightwing groups that handpicked him if the Constitution and the law required it.  Judge Gorsuch was given a full and fair hearing. He was given every opportunity to explain his judicial record and his views and to meet the expectations I laid out for him. I came away from this hearing firmly convinced that I must oppose the nomination of Neil  Here are the reasons:  Judge Gorsuch favors corporations and elites over the rights and voices of Americans, often using selective textualism to advance his agenda. Judge Gorsuch's hearing reinforced my fear that he would lean toward corporations and special interest elites at the expense of American workers and families.  Big business and special interests have found a friend under the Roberts Supreme I noted at the hearing a study by the Constitutional Accountability Center that found that under Chief Justice John Roberts the Supreme Court has ruled for positions that have been advocated by the Chamber of Commerce 69 percent of the time.  I am concerned, based on a review of his record, that Judge Gorsuch is likely to increase the pro-business leanings of the Roberts In a series of decisions--and I have read many of them--involving workers' rights, discrimination claims, consumer rights, and access to the courts, Judge Gorsuch has, time and again, favored corporations. He has often substituted his own judgment for those of the agencies that are tasked with protecting the workers.  No case was more egregious than the TransAm Trucking case, which was brought up repeatedly at the hearing. The facts are pretty well known by now. In January, Alphonse Maddin, a truck driver from Detroit, was stuck on the side of Interstate 88 in my home State of Illinois, and it was 14 degrees below zero outside. The brakes on his trailer were frozen. After waiting for a repair truck for several hours without his having any heat in the cab of his truck, Alphonse Maddin's body was starting to go numb. He called the trucking company one more time. They said: You have two options--stay in that truck or drag that frozen trailer down the interstate highway.  Both of those options were a risk to health and safety and common sense. So, instead, Al Maddin unhitched the broken-down trailer and drove to a gas station to fuel up and get warm and then returned to the disabled trailer. For this, the company fired him, and that firing blackballed him from ever working as a truck driver again.  Al Maddin came by my office and explained what he did. He had heard that there was some Federal agency that might consider what he had considered to be an unfair firing, so he went down to the agency and took out a ballpoint pen and filled out the complaint in longhand without the advice of counsel or any help. He was shocked when he won.  The case went further on appeal. Seven different judges heard Al Maddin's case. Six of them agreed that what had happened to him was unfair and unlawful. The only judge who found for the trucking company was Neil  Judge Gorsuch's dissent claimed that he was merely looking at the plain text of the law and the dictionary's definition and that was why Al Maddin had been fired. But the Tenth Circuit majority said that Neil Gorsuch was cherry-picking one dictionary's definition to come to his conclusion. Other dictionaries and the law's purpose of protecting health and safety had been ignored by Judge  Republican nominees like Judge Gorsuch often claim they are using the supposedly neutral philosophies of originalism and textualism to guide their decision making, but Al Maddin's case shows how Judge Gorsuch used a selective choice of text to advance a pro-business agenda at the expense of this American worker.  There are many other cases in Judge Gorsuch's record that demonstrate this trend, leading the Associated Press to say that Gorsuch's workers' rights opinions are ``often sympathetic but coldly pragmatic, and they're usually in the employer's favor.''  Take a look at the Hobby Lobby case. In that case, Judge Gorsuch expanded the idea that a corporation--a business--is a person. Why? He wanted to permit a for-profit corporation to impose its owners' personal religious beliefs on more than 13,000 employees who worked at that corporation and to limit their access to healthcare under insurance policies.  In finding for the corporation, Judge Gorsuch barely acknowledged that this decision burdened these thousands of employees and their personally constitutionally protected religious beliefs and choices.  Judge Gorsuch also has a troubling record when it comes to protecting the rights of Americans with disabilities and those who are victims of discrimination. It was quite a scene when, last week, in the midst of our hearing on Judge Gorsuch, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling that rejected a standard that had been created by Judge I am sure that has never happened in history. This standard, which Judge Gorsuch had promoted for a case in which he wrote the majority opinion, weakened protections for students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education  In 2008, Judge Gorsuch wrote in the Luke case that, under the IDEA, schools need only to provide educational benefits to students with disabilities that are merely more than de minimis.  At issue was the legal responsibility of a school district to provide educational opportunities for a child with[[Page S2025]]disabilities. In this case, Luke was a boy from Colorado who had suffered from severe autism. With the assistance and support of his teachers, Luke had made significant progress in school--in kindergarten and first grade. Then, when his family moved to a new home, he had to change school districts. At his new school, Luke began to lose the skills he had gained. His behavior was worse.  After unsuccessful attempts to address these concerns, Luke's parents decided that they ``could not in good conscience continue to expose their son, Luke, to this environment that was so detrimental to his educational and behavioral development.'' They decided to enroll Luke in a residential school that was dedicated to the education of children with his type of autism spectrum disorder.  A due process hearing officer, a Colorado State administrative law judge, and a Federal district court all found that the school district had failed to provide the education that was guaranteed to Luke under the Federal law of IDEA and that it was, therefore, required to reimburse the cost of the private residential school placement that Luke needed.  His parents were desperate to give Luke a chance in life, but then Judge Gorsuch ruled against them. In so doing, he created a new, lower standard for school districts in the process.  I asked Judge Gorsuch about this. He claimed he was just following the law and precedent, but as I pointed out at the hearing, that was not accurate. A legal analysis showed that Judge Gorsuch was the first judge in that circuit to add the word ``merely'' to the standard.  Luke P.'s father, Jeff, testified at the hearing and said that Judge Gorsuch's ``subtle wordcraft'' had the effect of ``further restricting an already restricted precedent with, unfortunately, my son in the bull's-eye of that decision.''  What did Chief Justice John Roberts of the U.Supreme Court say of the Gorsuch standard? Here is what he said: ``When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing `merely more than de minimis' progress [Gorsuch's words] from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.''  The Supreme Court sent a strong message when they released this opinion in the midst of Judge Gorsuch's hearing. The Court unanimously said that the Judge Gorsuch standard was inconsistent with the law. On this issue, Judge Gorsuch, the nominee, is somewhere to the right even of Justice Clarence This case is not an outlier. In fact, an analysis of his disability decisions shows that Judge Gorsuch has ruled against disabled students in 8 out of 10 IDEA cases.  There was also a consistent pattern of Judge Gorsuch's record on discrimination and retaliation involving employers. Bloomberg BNA analyzed this record and found that he ruled for employers 8 out of 12 times.  For example, he ruled against a sex discrimination claim brought by a UPS saleswoman; a disability discrimination claim that was brought by a college professor; an age discrimination claim that was brought by two maintenance workers; a race discrimination claim that was brought by an African-American grocery store employee who was called a ``monkey'' by his supervisor; a gender and disability discrimination claim that was brought by a female county accountant with multiple sclerosis; and a discrimination claim that was brought by a transgender woman who sought to use the restroom of her gender identity.  The case of Grace Hwang was particularly troubling to me. ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2019-4.txt,326,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,March

954,topic-id,809,"Mr.President, allow me to take a moment of the Senate's time to say thank you and farewell to an exceptional person.  Ed Greelegs was my chief of staff for 17 years, and he was a wise and trusted friend. I was not unique in that regard. Ed had thousands of friends. I used to marvel while walking through the Capitol with Ed Greelegs because he knew everybody, and everybody knew him--not just the Members of Congress and their staff but cafeteria workers, carpenters, Capitol Police officers, and certainly Senators, Congressmen, and their staffs. He was a beloved member of the Senate community, and what a smart fellow he was.  During my first 10 years in the Senate, when Ed was my chief of staff, he was an unfailing source of wise and thoughtful advice. Some people are drawn to Congress because of what they think are the perks and power that come with this job. That is not what attracted Ed  For Ed, being a good public servant was always a privilege. He avoided the spotlight. He was there to help people and to help move America closer to that more perfect Union our Founders dreamed of.  Fifteen years ago, Ed was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's. He and his wife Susan faced that formidable challenge the same way they faced everything: together, with love, determination, courage, and a good sense of humor.  Sadly, yesterday, Ed's battle with Parkinson's ended, and he passed away at the age of 66.  Parkinson's disease is a bitter adversary. Over the years, it took away Ed's sure-footedness. It nearly killed him twice. In the end, it robbed him of many memories. I can recall speaking to him a few months back, and Susan had warned me that he didn't have much of a memory, she said, unless you want to talk about politics. So I called him, and we talked about politics--even the politics of the day--and Ed was spot on. He always was. But regardless of the loss of memory, it never took away Ed's dignity, his kindness, or his respect for others.  Ed Greelegs worked for so many Members of Congress from Illinois that I think he became an honorary son of[[Page S2085]]our He grew up in Washington, DC, in the suburb of Wheaton, MD, and graduated from the University of  He came to the Capitol as an intern in 1970.

His quiet, wry sense of humor helped to lighten the mood when things became tense, and his profound compassion and decency reminded all of us of why we were really there.  There were a couple of things that Ed loved more than public service, and one was books. Ed's desk and his bedside were always surrounded by mountains of books. More than reading, Ed loved his family, especially his dear wife Susan and his stepchildren, Andrew and  I have a thousand Ed Greelegs stories, but I am going to close with my favorite.

As the back end of the plane ramp went down on to the runway and we were brought off, we were surrounded by armored personnel carriers and men holding rifles. These armored personnel carriers were as far as the eye could see, and the armed troops as well.  As I came down the ramp, a man in civilian clothes walked up to me and said: Are you Senator Durbin?  I said: Yes, I am.  He said: Well, I am a personal friend of Ed  I couldn't believe it.

1186,topic-id,1352,"Mr.President, most Americans agree--and I think last week's vote in the House indicated--that there is something special about healthcare. This just isn't the right of every American to own an SUV; it is the right of every American to have access to healthcare. That is really at the heart of our healthcare debate.  There are some who believe that health insurance ought to be another product on the shelf, and if you have enough money, you can buy it. But there are others, like me, who believe it is more fundamental.  Healthcare in America, as far as I am concerned, should be a right--not a privilege, a right--so that it doesn't go just to wealthy people. Everyone should have that peace of mind.  I have told the story many times on the floor of the Senate--and many of us are products of our own life experience. My wife and I got married when I was a student in law school here at Georgetown, in God sent us a beautiful little girl right away, but she had some medical problems--serious ones--and I didn't have any health insurance. I was a law student, had no real income, a wife, and a baby with a medical problem.  I ended up sitting in the charity ward of the local children's hospital with a number in my hand, waiting to see who would come through the door to provide me with healthcare for my little girl. I had never felt worse in my life as a father, as a husband, to think that I had reached this point where I didn't have health insurance, and I wasn't sure that I was bringing the very best medical care to my little girl.  Well, I never forgot that experience in the many years since, and I never will. I don't believe anybody should be sitting in that chair, worried because they don't have health insurance--whether they have the kind of healthcare that their family needs.  I think that is at the heart of this debate on our healthcare system in America and its future. What we are talking about today is part of it, as well, because we had decided 40 years ago--maybe more--that we were going to make sure, if you were poor in America, as a woman, you would still have access to basic healthcare. Poverty would not exclude you from healthcare. So we created this title X program to provide healthcare primarily for low-income families but for women and children. The services that are provided are basic life-and-death services--everything from breast and cervical care screening, high blood pressure screening, anemia, diabetes testing, and so on.  There is not much debate as to whether we should provide those services, but you know what this is all about. It is not about what I just read. It is about family planning, and it is about abortion. That is what this is really all about.  The Republicans who are voting to deny women access to healthcare are saying: We are doing this to reduce the incidence of abortion.  There is something they should admit: You cannot spend one penny of Federal money for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or where the life of the mother is in danger. Not here in the United States, not overseas.  What they say instead is: Well, we don't want to provide any money to any place that might use their own funds for abortion services, like Planned So we have this amendment before us.  For thousands of women and families in my State of Illinois, as Senator Murray has explained, it means the Republicans--who were all for choice in[[Page S2133]]healthcare--don't want women of limited means to have their ultimate choice of Planned Parenthood for their services. So the Republicans have brought in the Vice President of the United States to vote in the Senate  For those who are following the Senate, that doesn't happen very often. It has to be a big deal. And it must be a big deal to the Vice President and to the Republican Party to bring back one of our colleagues, who has been on the mend from medical care, and to bring in the Vice President to make that difference.  Their argument is: Well, we are just trying to reduce the number of abortions.  Well, if you have taken anything beyond Birds and Bees 101, there are some things that you might know. We had a study in Louis that was reported in 2012 that tells many people who are at least aware of the basics of how children are born something that we knew already and knew intuitively. Here is what it found:       The abortion rate in the Louis area declined by more      than 20 percent from 2008 to 2010, coinciding with a research      study that gave free birth control to thousands of area      women.       Although the drop in abortions in Louis cannot be      attributed solely to the project, the abortion rate for the      rest of Missouri--  Not in the study--     remained constant.       Contraception is key to reducing unintended pregnancies and      abortions, said Jeff ``We need to remove cost      barriers,'' Peipert said. ``I think all women should have      equal access.''       Teenage participants--  In this study--     experienced a birth rate of 6.3 babies per 1,000 girls,      compared with the national rate of 34.3, according to the      study published . . . in the journal Obstetrics and            There were an average of six abortions a year for every      1,000 women in the project, compared with the national rate      of 20.  Coincidence? I don't think so.  When you make family planning accessible to potential mothers and to the families, people are educated and make informed choices. There are fewer unplanned pregnancies. There are fewer teenage pregnancies. There are fewer abortions.  So the Republicans, by reducing the access of women to clinics and agencies that are providing family planning, reduce the likelihood they will get the information they need and the likelihood that abortions will increase--exactly the opposite of what they say they are trying to do.  Common sense dictates that--whatever your position is on abortion and choice--if you believe that an uninformed and uneducated young mother is the right person to make this decision as to whether they are going to have a family, I think you understand what all of us do: Information, assistance, and quality healthcare is critically important for women to make the right choice for themselves and their families and to avoid unplanned pregnancies.  We are now experiencing the lowest rates of unplanned pregnancies in the United States in the last 30 years and the lowest incidence of teenage pregnancies in the last 30 years, and the abortion rate is going down. It works. It is connecting.  This vote that the Republicans are forcing us to take--which the President, I am afraid, would sign, if it were sent to his desk--really gets at the heart of the issue. If you want to reduce the number of abortions in America, if you want to make them safe, legal, and rare, as they say, for goodness' sake, provide basic family planning information and services to women who otherwise might not have it.  This is a war against Planned Parenthood and a few other facilities that is mindless. It really is stopping information from people who desperately need it. Without that information, there will be bad results--bad results that often lead to abortions.  So I would just say flat out that we don't talk a lot about the A-word, ``abortion,'' on the floor, but that is really what is driving this debate. That is what is really behind it.  I hope that one more Republican colleague will decide that if you are truly against abortion, you should be in favor of family planning and giving basic information and counseling to young women who need it. That was proven in It is proven by our human experience. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this effort.  I thank the Senator from Washington for leading this debate on the floor.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2122-2.txt,326,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,30.0,March
1237,topic-id,1061,"Mr.President, for 7 years, Republicans in Congress have promised to ``repeal and replace ObamaCare,'' but not once during those 7 years did they actually put together a piece of legislation to make good on that promise.  Not once during those 7 years did Republican leaders actually convene serious hearings and meetings with patients, hospitals, insurers, and medical groups to discuss how best to reform our healthcare system, instead preferring to just rail against the law.  Not once during those 7 years did congressional Republicans actually try to sit down with Democrats and work on a bipartisan basis to improve upon the law.  But here is what they did do: They did everything possible to gum up the works, with many Republican Governors even refusing to expand Medicaid, denying millions of their constituents access to healthcare.  They went on TV, did interviews, and held campaign rallies about how all of[[Page S2147]]the challenges facing our healthcare system, challenges that we faced even before we passed the ACA, was the fault of ObamaCare and made empty promises about ``repeal and replace.''  Congressional Republicans voted over 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act when they knew President Obama was in office and he would veto repeal--60 times.  Now, with Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, the White House, you know what they are doing? Nothing--they cancelled their vote last Friday to repeal the law.  Why? As evidenced last week, they are incapable of developing a proposal that garners the support of their own Republican They are incapable of bringing a piece of legislation to the House Floor for a vote, despite having a large Republican majority in the  Now, after 17 legislative days of trying to ram through a bill that would have thrown at least 24 million people off their health insurance, reduced protections for 178 million people who have employer-based coverage, increased costs for seniors and rural communities, and given a huge tax break to drug companies and the wealthiest Americans, Republicans are giving up.  Time to move on, they say; time to tackle tax reform, they say.  Well, I, along with the majority of Americans who have benefited from this law, am relieved.  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect--no law is.  It made sure 20 million more Americans could get health insurance, including 1 million As a result, our uninsured rate is at its lowest level in our Nation's history.  Young people are staying on their parents' plans till age 26, and seniors are seeing big savings on their prescription drugs.  Women can no longer be charged more than men for the same coverage, and people with preexisting conditions can no longer be discriminated against.  Annual and lifetime caps on benefits are a thing of the past, and people now have access to maternity and newborn care, as well as mental health and substance abuse treatment.  Now that Republicans have acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act is, as Speaker Ryan stated, ``the law of the land . . . for the foreseeable future,'' it is time to start building off of it.  Like Medicare and Social Security before it, it is time to make some bipartisan modifications that can help improve the law.  We need to increase insurer competition because, in too many of our communities, there are not enough options.  We need to address individual market premium increases because, for too many of our constituents, an affordable health plan is still out of reach.  I, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, have put forth ideas to deal with some of these issues.  I support the creation of a ``public plan,'' which would both increase competition in areas that are lacking and drive down premiums since, as Medicare has demonstrated time and again, the Federal Government can be more efficient than private for-profit companies.  I support legislation to bring down the high cast of prescription drugs, which are driving up premiums for families nationwide.  BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois now pays more for prescription drugs than they do on inpatient hospital costs, and they readily admit that drug costs are contributing to premium hikes.  We need to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. We need to end ``pay for delay'' agreements and get cheaper drugs on the market quicker. We need to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising. We need more transparency into how drug prices are set, and we need penalties on drug companies that gouge the American public.  I also support enforcing portions of the law that Republicans have sabotaged and undermined since its inception. We need to allow the ``risk corridor'' program to operate unimpeded. We need to expand Medicaid in all States, especially since we know that premiums are highest and competition lowest in nonexpansion States, and we need to enforce the law--which is why the very first order of business going forward must be for President Trump to rescind the Executive order he issued on January 20.  The President's order directed the heads of all Federal agencies responsible for implementing and enforcing the Affordable Care Act to stand down, to not implement the law, to not enforce the law.  Now that the page has hopefully been turned on the ugly ``repeal'' chapter of this saga, it is time for the President and his administration to faithfully implement, enforce, and help improve this law.  I am calling on the President and congressional Republicans: Now is the time to stop undermining the law that is enjoying record support from  Now is not time to throw sand in the law's eyes, put a spoke in its wheel, and then turn around, gloat, and blame Democrats when it does not function properly.  The Affordable Care Act while championed by Democrats and President Obama, included over 100 Republican amendments and, for better or worse, borrowed heavily from Republican ideas for the marketplace.  Let's end these partisan games.  This law--the good and the shortcomings--is on all of us to improve.  Democrats have ideas, but we cannot do it alone. Remember, the Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, and the White  They are in charge. If improvements are going to be made, Republicans are going to have to get serious.

1241,topic-id,551,"Mr.President, last week in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Comey confirmed what many of us have been urging for months: the need for an independent commission to look into the Russian act of cyber war on our election and any possible collusion with members of the Trump campaign.  Comey confirmed that the FBI was ``investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russian efforts.''  He continued that FBI agents would pursue the investigation ``no matter how long that takes.''  This is incredible. I am not surprised, but it is incredible. Our Nation's top law enforcement agency is investigating possible links between those involved in President Trump's campaign and a foreign adversary known to have conducted an aggressive intelligence operation to help him get elected, and all the while, this President continues to deny any such attack, praise the dictator who launched the attack, and pursue policies that mirror those of the attacker, including the weakening of the Western security alliance.  Yet what has been the priority of the majority party amid this mounting and serious breach, one we already knew about 5 months ago?  Has it been to set up an independent commission to look into this unprecedented threat to our Nation and democracy?  Has it been to work with the White House to disclose all information in an open and transparent manner to clear up any concerns or suspicions? No, in fact the opposite--we still haven't even seen the President's tax returns to get answers on Russian money in his businesses.  Has it been to pass sanctions on Russia for its attack on our Nation?  Has it been to pass meaningful cyber security legislation, legislation blocked by the majority in the last Congress to make sure our next elections in less than 2 years are secure from attack?

The big money, they say that they want even more money, so they want to be able to dig into your private information so that they can figure out when you get up, when you go to bed, what you looked up, and then write ads just so they could try to sell you more stuff.  And as disgusting as that is, you can see easily how that is not the end of it. What if you have somebody who has something really sensitive that they just want a little bit more information about, that is not of a nature where it is saleable, but it is just their business?

People 50 to 64 will be hit with an age tax and pay premiums five times higher than everybody else. Deductibles will go up. And protections that make sure insurance companies offer minimum value will be thrown out.  Again, the Republican bill, TrumpCare--pay more, get less--but it gives billionaires a tax break. That is really important; isn't it? With the Affordable Care Act, we set out to give Americans more affordable, higher quality health care.  Is the law perfect? We should be working together to tweak the law. We should be working together to improve the law, not putting in a clunker like this bill, which will roll back the time on people's coverage. Roll back the time, give people less coverage, and let them pay more. That is not what the American people want. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

It should be the right of our States to allocate subgrants under the title X program in the way that best fits the needs of the people living there. Unfortunately, like many other rules that were issued during the Obama administration, this rule attempted to empower Federal bureaucrats in Washington and silence our  As we all know, States are closer to and more familiar with the healthcare providers and patients within their borders and should be able to make their own decisions about the best eligible title X subgrantees, be they hospitals, federally qualified community health centers, or other types of providers. A number of States have acted in recent years to prioritize title X subgrants to more comprehensive providers, where women can receive greater preventive and primary care than they can with providers like Planned  The Obama administration's rule attempted to claim that providers like Planned Parenthood can ``accomplish title X programmatic objectives more effectively.'' This rhetoric does not match the reality. In fact, after Representative Diane Black and I led more than 100 of our colleagues in pointing that out to the Obama administration, HHS acknowledged the challenge of measuring effectiveness across all types of title X recipients and subrecipients and therefore removed the word ``effectively'' from the final rule.  So why was this rule implemented in the first place? It is because the Obama administration wanted to do everything it could to secure Federal funding streams for Planned Parenthood before they turned over the keys to the Trump administration. With our vote today, we prevented that from happening.  But let me be clear. Although it is no secret that I do not believe Planned Parenthood--the Nation's single largest provider of abortion services--is deserving of Federal taxpayer dollars, this legislation does not prevent Planned Parenthood or any other specific entity from receiving title X funds. If States like Washington or Massachusetts want to distribute title X subgrants to Planned Parenthood, this legislation to overturn the Obama administration's rule will not prevent them from doing so, nor does overturning the rule reduce overall funding levels for the Title X Family Planning  In fact, this legislation does not in any way decrease women's healthcare[[Page S2139]]funding. Rather, overturning the rule merely empowers States over a Washington-knows-best mentality and assures that States have the ability to identify the best eligible title X subgrantees. It restores local control and ensures that States aren't forced by the Federal Government to provide abortion providers like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars.  I appreciate my colleagues' support of this legislation, and I look forward to President Trump signing it and scrapping the Obama administration's overreaching eleventh-hour rule.

508,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Colorado for his leadership and for yielding time to me.  First of all, I would like to respond to the gentleman's presentation about the underlying bill.  Make no mistake about it, what the underlying bill does today is it wipes out--it totally wipes out--privacy protections for consumers on the internet. That is what it does. There are not duplicative regulations. I know that it was stated on the floor that there are duplicative regulations.  There are two agencies--the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission--however, it is only the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, that can actually protect consumers by enforcing the protections. The FTC does not have that authority.  What happens today if these privacy protections are ripped away from the American people? Well, all the information that you give to your internet service provider, whether it is Comcast, whether it is cable providers, Charter, AT&T, the one that you pay a pretty big bill to, they can take all of the information that they have--my account, your account, your account, your account--and use that information to sell it to the highest bidder to make money off of it.  Now, there is an additional charge in this thing, alleged charge, and that is,[[Page H2480]]well, what about Google and Netflix and Facebook? What about them? Why aren't they subject to what the FCC did? Well, they are edge providers. They are edge providers.  You don't have to go to You don't have to go to You don't have to go to Netflix in order to get your internet service. That is why the FCC did not apply these rules to them. Maybe there should be a debate about them. But to equalize and say that Google and Facebook are equal to your internet service provider suggests to me that some people just don't know what they are talking about.  This is a subject that the American people feel very, very deeply about. In fact, I think it is in the DNA of every American: ``I want my privacy, and it should be protected.'' We all feel that way.  What is being done today is a ripping away. It is like taking a bandage, just stripping it away. Who do you go to? Who do you go to complain to? No one. No one. Because there isn't anything left to enforce.  I think it is a sad day if the underlying bill passes. I think it is shocking that my Republican colleagues, either out of a lack of understanding of how the internet works, how their constituents--all of our constituents benefit from these protections of our privacy, and our information is private. I don't want anyone to take my information and sell it to someone and make a ton of money off of it just because they can get their mitts on it. That is why the privacy protections were adopted.

There may not be that many people on the floor of the House, but this is a big one. This is really a big one. Congress is poised today to betray the American people on one of the issues they care the most about: their privacy--their privacy. Every single one of us cares about it, and so do the American people. I often say that every American has it in their DNA: Keep your mitts off my privacy, what I consider to be private.  Now, the consequences of passing this resolution are clear. Broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission, and no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about. It is like open the door and there is no one there. That is what this thing creates.  The Republicans are blowing a gaping hole in Federal privacy protections by barring the FCC from ever adopting similar protections in the future. So, if it is gone today, it is gone, period.  The FCC rules are simple. They require broadband providers to get the permission of their customers--including all of us--before they can sell their web browsing history, their location information, and other sensitive data to third parties.  The majority claims that we need to repeal these protections because they treat broadband providers differently than other online service providers, edge providers. Broadband providers are in the unique position of seeing everything we do on the internet. This is the reason, and it is reason enough, to put privacy protections in place; but it is also important to keep in mind that consumers, all of us, pay a high monthly fee to broadband providers, and they face serious barriers if they want to switch. If I want to switch, if you want to switch, you have to, many times, pay early termination fees.  This is completely different from other online services that collect consumer data. Consumers don't pay to use search engines or social media applications like Google and If they don't like Google's privacy policy, they can switch over to Bing without paying any fees. But consumers can't do this with broadband providers, and therein lies the difference.  Last week, we heard the Republicans bemoan the lack of choice in the healthcare market. They should take a closer look at the state of the broadband market, particularly in rural America, where only 13 percent of consumers have access to more than one high-speed broadband provider.  So the majority is telling Americans today, particularly those in rural areas, that they need to choose between their privacy and their access to the internet. If this resolution passes, people across the country will certainly not have both.  This resolution is--excuse the phrase--repeal without replace. The Republicans have not put forward any privacy proposal at all to replace the FCC's rules, despite knowing that repealing these rules will leave a gap in the Federal protections.  So the message to the American people is clear: Your privacy doesn't matter, and your web browsing history should be available to anyone who will pay the highest price for it.  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand up for privacy rights and oppose this joint resolution.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2489.txt,355,ISSUES BEFORE THE SENATE,2017.0,28.0,March
829,topic-id,2292,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the so-called HONEST Whether in its incarnation last Congress as the Secret Science Act or in this year's incarnation as the HONEST Act, let us be clear, this Orwellian-named bill is clearly designed to suppress certain scientific research that has been the foundation for essential health and environmental regulations.  In addition to hindering scientific advancement, this bill risks violating people's privacy by exposing sensitive patient data, and it is harmful to public health.  The clear aim of the HONEST Act is to undermine EPA's efforts to take action in a variety of areas, such as climate and air pollution.  Let me also be clear, in my State of Connecticut, we rely on those regulations to deal with the asthma crisis we have based on power plants in other parts of the country blowing polluted air into my  The so-called HONEST Act accomplishes this objective by excluding legitimate, peer-reviewed research from the policy process. If this bill were to become law, EPA would have no choice but to lean increasingly on industry-funded studies instead.  At my recent townhall meeting in Waterbury, Connecticut, one American after another stood up and expressed their fear and outrage at the attempts made in this House and by the new administration to take science out of public policy.  My constituents want genuine scientific research guiding our efforts to protect our environment and safeguard public health. They don't want agenda-driven studies funded by fossil fuel companies determining the EPA's actions on climate policy.                              {time}  1415  While the majority attempted to alleviate some of our privacy concerns with this bill, the reality is that any person whom EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt deems worthy will have access to sensitive patient information.  Why is this a problem?  Because fewer people will be willing to participate in the studies that are necessary to understand air and water quality issues.  Who can blame them?  No one wants their medical records shared with strangers, or worse, made public.  The result is that the EPA will have to rely on incomplete science to issue lifesaving regulations.  Sadly, Mr.Speaker, this bill is yet another example of the political crusade against science that we are seeing coming from both Congress and the new administration.  We should be confronting the economic and environmental realities of our changing climate. But just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order that would have us pretend that climate change does not exist.  Only weeks earlier, the EPA Administrator himself said, without evidence, that he disagreed with the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary contributor to global climate change.  In my home State of Connecticut, we are downwind from these power plants that are burning dirty coal. We see elevated rates of asthma, higher rates of cardiopulmonary issues. If this bill is passed, many longitudinal, scientific studies like the ones that establish the link between air pollution and asthma, would be excluded from playing a role in the EPA's actions.  Mr.Speaker, let's allow the EPA to do its job. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition from the Union of Concerned Scientists and from the Environmental Defense                                Union of Concerned Scientists,                                                    March 9, 2017.       Dear Representative: The Union of Concerned Scientists,      with 500,000 members and supporters throughout the country,      strongly opposes H.1430, the misleadingly named Honest and      Open New EPA Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) of 2017. The      proposal shows that supporters of this legislation have a      fundamental misunderstanding of the process by which science      operates and is ultimately a solution in search of a problem.       This legislation would require that all raw data, models,      code, and other materials from scientific studies be made      available to the public before a federal agency could use it.      But, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already is      exhaustingly transparent and the science it relies on to make      decisions is made available to the public.       The true intention of this bill is not to increase      transparency in agency use of science in policymaking, but      rather to handcuff the EPA from ever using critical      information necessary to follow through on statutorily      required rulemaking for popular legislation like the Clean      Air Act and the Clean Water The additional restrictions      imposed by this proposed bill would make it almost impossible      to base public protections on the best available scientific      information. In particular, if enacted, the language appears      to indicate that the EPA would be inhibited by the following      challenges:       The EPA wouldn't be able to use most health studies. It      should be expected that any agency tasked with protecting      public health should be able to use public health data. The      confidentiality of such data is usually protected by      institutional review boards[[Page H2541]]     (IRB) to insure the privacy of the participants; thus, the      data could not be made publicly available as demanded. Since      many EPA rules are health-based standards, this rule would      severely restrict the ability of the agency to base rules on      science.       The EPA wouldn't be able to draw from industry data      sources. The agency would be prevented from using data      provided by industry to the agency. Since information from      industry sources is often not publicly available, to protect      proprietary data from their competitors, a law requiring as      such would prevent the agency from utilizing industry data, a      source of information that often provides otherwise unknown      data to inform EPA rulemaking.       The EPA wouldn't be able to use new and innovative science.      New scientific methods and data may be restricted by      intellectual property protections or industry trade secret      exemptions. This bill doesn't include protections for      intellectual property, and it makes industry trade secrets      available upon request to anyone who signs an agreement. If      researchers and industry knew that sharing their science with      the EPA meant that their intellectual property would be      exposed to the world, they might opt out. This would limit      EPA's ability to rely on the best available science including      novel approaches that may not yet be publicly available.       Long-term and meta-analyses would be unavailable. Many of      the public health and safety issues facing the nation cannot      be measured within a small timeframe. The EPA needs long-term      exposure studies that assess the link between chronic      diseases/mortality and pollutants; or on meta-analyses that      include many different studies and locations to provide a      more robust look at the science. In H.1430, the provision      that studies be conducted ``in a manner that is sufficient      for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of      research'' may prevent use of these vital studies by the EPA,      as it is unclear whether such spatially and temporally      comprehensive studies would be considered ``sufficient for      substantial reproduction.''       The CBO estimates exorbitant costs. The attempt to      implement this law would also make the EPA process much more      costly. For past iterations of this legislation, the CBO has      estimated it may take up to $250 million annually for the EPA      simply to comply, and that doesn't even account for the lost      benefits from delaying the protections themselves. Compounded      with the cuts to EPA's budget that are being proposed, this      would just further prevent the agency from being able to do      its job.       H.1430 makes a token attempt to address some of the      criticisms about privacy concerns for personal medical      information and trade secrets. But in practice, the challenge      of identifying and redacting all protected and privileged      information sets up a series of hurdles and complications      that will deter agencies from using the best scientific      analysis to inform their work.       Small, cosmetic tweaks do not change the fact that this      bill is based on a flawed premise and that the authors of the      legislation do not understand the scientific process.      Furthermore, the burden imposed on the EPA to redact      documents would ultimately place limits on the amount of      actual scientific work the EPA can do. The EPA does not exist      in a world of infinite resources.       When this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress as the      ``Secret Science Reform Act,'' it received a veto threat from      the Obama administration, which noted that it would      ``interfere'' with the EPA's ability to protect public      health, safety, and the environment. The worry is that now,      with an administration that has shown zero interest in using      science to enact safeguards, this legislation could cripple      the agency.       I strongly urge you to oppose H 1430, the so-called      HONEST The only honest thing about this legislation is      that it truly opens the window into the real intentions of      the supporters of the bill, and that is to stop the EPA from      fulfilling its science-based mission to protect public health      and the environment. H.1430 is a wolf in sheep's clothing,      purporting to increase public accessibility to data used in      rulemaking, while actually crippling the EPA's ability to use      the best available scientific and technical information to      protect public health and the environment.       Agencies protecting our public health should be able to use      public health data and attempts to undermine agencies      shouldn't be cloaked in false transparency. This Trojan-horse      transparency bill would inhibit the EPA's ability to carry      out its science-based mission to protect human health and the      environment. It does not deserve your support.

Despite their benign-sounding titles, these bills would      have devastating effects on public health and the      Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to consider      and use sound science.       The HONEST Act, a rebranded version of the ``Secret Science      Reform Act'' from prior sessions of Congress, is framed as a      measure to increase transparency by requiring that EPA only      use studies that are publicly available online and      replicable. Yet, as testimony before your Committee has made      clear, these requirements would in many cases prevent the EPA      from using the best available science for public health      decision-making.       Many epidemiological studies--for example a study on the      causes of breast cancer--rely on health data that are legally      confidential. This legislation suggests that EPA will be      given the authority to disclose confidential medical      information on breast cancer patients to anyone willing to      sign a confidentiality agreement. EPA would also be      responsible for identifying and redacting any information      that should not be made broadly publicly available in the      first place. Not only is this not an appropriate role for      EPA, it could severely restrict both the number of studies      EPA can use and the willingness of participants to be part of      vital health studies.       In addition, the Act's requirements for replicability mean      that critical longitudinal studies that follow health      outcomes of individuals or groups over years, even decades,      could not be used because--       (1) they are inherently not replicable (e.g., a study that      follows health outcomes of first responders following a      single event such as the tragic 9/11 attack); or       (2) where they are replicable, it would take years to show      that the results could be reproduced (e.g., a study that      examines the impacts on intelligence at childhood from      environmental exposures that occurred in utero).       Furthermore, even if, say, a longitudinal study that      follows a cohort of individuals over 20 years could in      principle be reproduced, there are practical and ethical      reasons why it couldn't or shouldn't be. The same goes for a      long-term environmental monitoring study, or data collected      from a one-time event like the Deepwater Horizon       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has found that      previous iterations of this legislation would impede the      number of studies the EPA can rely on--by their estimate,      reducing the number of studies by half. Restricting EPA to      just some of the existing scientific literature will prevent      the agency from using the latest and most accurate science      when developing regulations. Moreover, the tremendous      resource burden of making data publicly available (CBO's      central estimate was $250 million a year) would create a      strong incentive to reduce the amount of scientific data and      analysis considered as part of decision-making. The net      effect would be to undermine EPA's ability to rely on the      best available science and unnecessarily put the public at      greater environmental and health risk.       Similarly, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of      2017 undermines scientific integrity of the Contrary to      longstanding practice, the bill allows individuals with      financial conflicts of interest to serve on the EPA Science      Advisory Board (SAB) so long as those conflicts are      disclosed. This would permit an infusion of special corporate      interest into what should remain an objective scientific      review of EPA work products.       Incredibly, at the same time, the bill makes it more      difficult for academic experts to participate on the The      bill considers an expert's research on a topic covered by the      Board to be a conflict of interest, when in fact the      academic's expertise would make them more, not less,      valuable. In addition, receipt of EPA research grants and      contracts, standard for universities, would be construed to      constitute a conflict of interest for a scientist or expert.      And a SAB member would be precluded from accepting any such      grant or contract for three years after serving on the board      which may deter qualified experts from serving on the       The ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST)      Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act      of 2017'' would block the use of sound science by EPA in      developing public safeguards. For these reasons, EDF Action      strongly opposes these bills.

This is our future. This is our future. We are in the 21st century. We understand if we are to be very competitive in the world, we must leave no child behind.  It is important, Mr.Speaker, to recognize that the investments we are talking about benefit all of us. If we want a strong economy, these middle neighborhoods are essential. These middle neighborhoods are where people grow and develop. They go on to college. They do well in school, and they hold our society together.  The President's budget undermines and cuts the crucial investments we have made in our cities and our neighborhoods, neighborhoods that we all come from, neighborhoods where we all recognize the importance of these communities. We should not take this for granted because the reality is, as my colleague from Florida said, our values are where our dollars are.  I totally agree with her because she is really telling us all that you can pay now or you can pay later. It is better to pay on the front end rather than the back end. It is better to understand that these communities are communities that help America be what it is today.  The President's budget undermines and cuts critical investments. The President's budget does not give our cities the adequate resources to invest in our communities and moves our cities in the wrong direction.  I think that the President, as my colleague just said earlier, says: What do we have to lose? Well, we have a lot to lose under this proposed budget.  This budget is no new deal for Black As a matter of fact, this is no deal at all. We clearly understand that this means cuts in health care, education, affordable housing, and food nutritional programs.  This is no deal because we understand that we must make investments. If we are talking about moving America forward and we are talking about making it what we know it can be in terms of America, we must make this investment. But we cannot make these investments, we cannot be talking out both sides of our mouths, and we cannot, on one hand, say what do we have to lose and then, on the other hand, do nothing in the budget whatsoever. So it is clear, Mr.Speaker, that we have a missed opportunity here.  I am proud to stand as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and join with all of my colleagues, as the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus has said, as being the conscience of the It is important to understand that we don't take that lightly. That is why we stand here today, Mr. We stand here to raise the voice, to stress to people that we are not going to give up, that we recognize that we all have a responsibility and an obligation in this democracy, that this is our democracy and it is something that we should never take for granted.  We have a lot to lose. We stand to lose everything that made our neighborhoods stronger block by block. So, Mr.Speaker, I stand here with all of my colleagues to carry this message to everyone that we are never going to give up--never, never, never.

I was fortunate enough to visit Israel in 2011 and saw firsthand the high level of strategic cooperation between the United States and Israel militarily, businesswise, technologywise, and socially.  Almost 32 years ago, the U.signed its first-ever free trade agreement with Israel, leading to almost $40 billion in trade annually.

The U.and Israeli militaries also maintain a high level of cooperation and support. Our two nations regularly hold joint exercises and work side by side in developing new technologies, including missile defense systems, weapons technologies, and more.  Situated in an extremely hostile neighborhood, Israelis share a unique understanding of the threats posed by Islamic terror groups.

423,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, I speak on behalf of myself and Senator Harris to reintroduce legislation to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area, California's first National Heritage I am very pleased to work with Senator Harris, Congressman John Garamendi, and our colleagues in the State on this much needed legislation. Our legislation will establish a new national heritage area in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to promote environmental stewardship, heritage conservation, and economic development across five delta counties.  The Delta Protection Commission will manage the heritage area in accordance with California law and in partnership with delta communities. The management planning process provided by this legislation will be open to the public and collaborative. Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, private property owners, and all stakeholders will have a voice in the management planning for the heritage area.  The goal is to conserve and protect the delta, its communities, its natural resources, and its rich history.  In short, this legislation does not affect water rights or water contracts, nor does it is impose any additional responsibilities on local governments or private landowners. Instead, this legislation authorizes federal assistance to support local projects as part of an inclusive process required by State law.  The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary in the Western United States and perhaps the most productive and ecologically important watershed in North This extensive inland delta is a natural marvel and national treasure that must be protected. The delta offers recreational opportunities enjoyed by millions of Californians and out-of-State visitors alike, who come each year for boating, fishing, hunting, and sightseeing.  The delta provides critical habitat for more than 750 wildlife species, including sandhill cranes and other migratory birds along the Pacific It also provides habitat for iconic native fish like the chinook salmon, some as large as 60 pounds, which return each year to travel through the delta to spawn in tributaries upstream.  These same waterways provide freshwater to millions of California households and irrigated farmland south of the delta and elsewhere in the  Before being converted for farmland starting in the 19th century, the delta flooded regularly following the springtime snowmelt and once supported the continent's largest Native American communities.  Later, the delta served as the gateway for the California Gold Rush, after which Chinese immigrant workers built hundreds of miles of levees to make the delta's rich peat soils available for farming and to control flooding.  Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Greek, South Asian, and other immigrants began the area's farming legacy and established proud communities that continue today.  Over the years, the vibrant ``river culture'' endemic to delta communities has attracted the attention of celebrated authors from Mark Twain and Jack London to Joan  A national heritage area designation would help to preserve this uniquely American story by providing supportive local governments across the delta with a needed management framework, technical assistance, and modest Federal funding.  Today, the delta faces crisis due to proliferate invasive species, urban and agricultural runoff, wastewater overloads, channelization, dredging, formidable water exports, and other stressors.  Many delta islands are now 10 to 20 feet below sea level due to subsidence, and the present levee system is inadequate in providing reliable flood protection for historic communities, agricultural enterprises, and infrastructure. Alarmingly, many existing levees were simply not engineered to withstand earthquakes. Should levees fail,[[Page S2000]]a rush of saltwater into the interior delta would damage this already fragile ecosystem, disrupt drinking water supplies, flood agricultural land, inundate towns, and damage roads, powerlines, and water infrastructure.  Establishing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area will secure much needed Federal resources for delta communities. Our legislation recognizes the delta as a working landscape central to California life and seeks to further local projects already underway that promote environmental stewardship, heritage conservation, community revitalization, and economic development throughout the delta.  This legislation also seeks to fulfill the broadly supported 2009 California State law that called for a heritage area designation for the delta and the Delta Protection Commission's own feasibility report in 2012.  Our legislation is a small part of the commitment the Federal Government must make to the California delta. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues at every level of government to restore the delta and its native species, upgrade California's water supply, safeguard against flood risk, improve water quality, and preserve delta communities' rich heritage and continued vibrancy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgS1997.txt,1332,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,March
1243,topic-id,768,"Mr.President, today I wish to express my disappointment in today's vote on H.67 and my strong opposition to H.66. These resolutions overturn rules issued by the Department of Labor that are essential to providing increased access to retirement savings programs at the city and State levels.  Among all working families in America ages 32 to 61, the median family in America had only $5,000 saved in 2013. This indicates to me that we are clearly facing a retirement savings crisis.  In California, 7.5 million workers don't have access to a retirement savings plan through their jobs, including 3.4 million women. Of those without a workplace retirement savings plan, almost 5 million are individuals of Color, and over 3.5 million are  The good news is that, when a person has access to a retirement savings program through their workplace, they are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.  In California, legislators have been working for more than 4 years to create the Secure Choice program as a way of addressing the retirement crisis we face. This program allows workers to easily save for retirement through a deduction made directly from their paycheck.  Those who need access to a workplace retirement program the most, individuals with lower incomes, are far less likely to have that access. These are the people who stand to gain the most from the Secure Choice program and lose the most by Congress halting its progress.  Let me share some examples of the people who would be impacted. Most eligible employees work for small businesses that might not be able to offer retirement savings plans on their own, and nearly half of eligible workers work in the retail, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing industries.  This program supports lower- and middle-class workers by providing access to the tools they need to control their financial future. The average wage of workers eligible for this program is $35,000, and 80 percent of eligible workers earn less than $50,000.  We are facing a time of deep income inequality and must stand up for programs that support the middle class, like Secure Nationwide, the bottom 90 percent of households have seen their income drop compared to what it was in 1970. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent has seen their household income triple.  As workers struggle to make ends meet, it is appalling to me that Congress would actively take away a key resource for financial planning.  Californians want to ensure that all employees have access to a retirement savings program. The Department of Labor's State rule clears the way for California to set up programs like Secure Choice by clarifying employers' obligations to the accounts.  This rule would also help small businesses compete for qualified workers who expect and deserve access to a workplace retirement savings program. Small Business California supports the Department of Labor's rule paving the way for these programs and opposes this resolution.  Finally, in California, our State chapter of the Chamber of Commerce specifically asked for an opinion from[[Page S2149]]the Department of Labor on employer obligations. Once the Department of Labor's rule was issued, CalChamber no longer opposed the California bill.  In fact, the legislation that passed in California requires the State board to report a finalized rule from the Department of Overturning the Department of Labor's rule completely ignores the effort and care taken in California to craft a program that works for both employees and employers.  Nationally, almost half of working-age households do not have retirement savings accounts, and 55 million people don't have access to a workplace retirement plan. This is shocking.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the median retirement account savings for families ages 56 to 61 was only $17,000 in 2013. This is only slightly higher than the 2016 poverty threshold for a household of two people aged 65 and older. It is inconceivable that a family could afford to finance their retirement with only $17,000 in savings.  Supporting retirement savings is not a partisan issue. In fact a bipartisan group of State treasurers oppose this resolution, as does the National Conference of State  We are facing a retirement savings crisis in our country, and the Department of Labor's rule is a simple, commonsense guideline that make it easier for individuals to save for retirement.  While today's vote is a disappointing development for city programs, I will keep fighting to support California's Secure Choice program. I strongly urge my colleagues to stand up for American workers and support their access to retirement savings programs by opposing H.66, should it come up for a vote on the Senate floor.

736,topic-id,853,"Mr.President, border security is one of the Federal Government's most important responsibilities, and the Federal Government has no better partners than local law enforcement agencies from border communities like those in my home State of These officers and deputies serve on the front lines. They provide critical assistance to the missions of Federal agencies.  Unfortunately, these efforts are expensive and the locals end up picking up most of the tab. For example, local law enforcement agencies hold those facing immigration violations at county-operated jails, and they provide medical care for the undocumented inmates while they are in custody. In providing these services, Arizona's counties have incurred more than $310 million in costs associated with criminal undocumented immigrants since 2009. That is $310 million since 2009.  Despite these enormous costs, the Federal Government has left many local jurisdictions to shoulder the burdens of illegal immigration on their own. This is particularly frustrating when so many of our local law enforcement agencies are already struggling to carry out basic duties on overstretched budgets.  I hope we can all look forward to a time when we have the appropriate resources for securing the border, the means for those seeking to fill the needs of our economy to enter the country legally, a remedy for those who are here already illegally, and also a way for employers to ensure that those whom they hire are legally present.  These critical steps toward solving our immigration problems will require Congress to act. However, in the meantime, we can't continue to allow the Federal Government to pass off immigration responsibilities onto cash-strapped local agencies.  That is why I wish today to introduce a bill to reauthorize and reform the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, better known as This bill is cosponsored by my friend and colleague, John McCain, and is supported by the Arizona Sheriffs  SCAAP is a Federal program that reimburses State, local, and Tribal law enforcement for the costs associated with incarcerating and caring for criminal undocumented immigrants while in custody.  To ensure that local law enforcement receives sufficient reimbursement under SCAAP, my bill would make some commonsense reforms under the program. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to reauthorize SCAAP through fiscal year 2021. Reauthorizing this program will provide local law enforcement agencies in Arizona and across the country with the certainty that any costs incurred from incarcerating criminal immigrants will be covered by Federal reimbursements.  Our State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies are committed to partnering with the Federal Government on immigration enforcement. But that partnership can't succeed unless the Federal Government provides the necessary reimbursements for those services.

County sheriffs maintain the shared responsibility of      enforcing Arizona's criminal laws. We also serve as the      keeper of Arizona's county jails, including paying for the      cost of medical care for inmates. While the federal      government continues to address the problem of illegal      immigration, Arizona's jails incarcerate undocumented      immigrants who have committed state and local violations,      incurring significant costs in custody and care of these      inmates, including medical costs. SCAAP provides critical      dollars to Arizona's counties that help pay for the cost of      housing and caring for these inmates while they are in our      custody.       Arizona's counties continue to struggle under the fiscal      strain of anemic growth in rural areas and cost-shifts from      the State of Housing criminal aliens without federal      assistance diverts needed resources away from our      communities' public safety priorities. We understand that      federal dollars cannot fully supplant state costs for these[[Page S2051]]     inmates. However, any financial assistance the federal      government can appropriate to help pay for the costs of      caring for these inmates will allow Arizona's sheriffs to      concentrate on other important priorities, such as drug      interdiction and search and rescue.       Since 2009, Arizona's counties have absorbed more than $310      million in costs. A SCAAP reauthorization that includes      reimbursement for medical costs would provide vital financial      resources to Arizona's sheriffs, allowing us to better serve      the public safety needs of our counties.       That's why on behalf of Arizona's county sheriffs, I write      to express support for the reauthorization of the State      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).

Mr.Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the House companion to S.34, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to support the resolution before us today. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I care deeply about protecting the privacy of our constituents, but I cannot support the Federal Communications Commission's counterproductive rules that will actually harm consumers and stifle innovation.  For 20 years, the Federal Trade Commission--or the FTC, as we call it, frequently--oversaw consumer privacy for the entire internet ecosystem: content providers, advertisers, and internet service providers, or The FTC's privacy program focused on preserving sensitive consumer data and took the context of a consumer's relationship with businesses into consideration. The FTC's experience in implementing a wide range of rules and regulations has resulted in over 500 cases protecting consumer information, ensuring their privacy online.  In a flawed political move, absent any finding, complaints, or investigations to determine whether broadband providers have violated consumers' privacy or that the FTC had failed at doing its job, the FCC proceeded with a partisan vote to target ISPs and to expand its regulatory footprint.  After stripping the FTC of its authority over the privacy practices of internet service providers, the FCC subsequently adopted rules that would harm consumers and split the internet, creating an uneven playing field between service providers and content providers. Congress must fix this overreach so the new administration can create a comprehensive, consistent set of privacy protections.                              {time}  1615  Consumers expect their privacy to be protected the same way no matter what type of entity holds their data. Having two sets of requirements creates confusion for consumers and may jeopardize their confidence in the internet.  Our internet economy has thrived under the privacy regime created by the Yet the FCC, under its previous Chairman, Tom Wheeler, wanted to undermine that success by bifurcating privacy protections to serve outside political interests, not the American consumer.  By contrast, the FCC's approach did not base its requirements on consumers' preferences about sensitive information and to set opt-in and opt-out defaults. Accordingly, its overall approach was top-down, heavyhanded regulation in stark contrast to the FTC's greater reliance on markets and consumer preferences.  The FCC's rule has a number of problematic issues:  The first is that the opt-in/opt-out regime reduces consumer choice and would be detrimental to the survival of many businesses in this country.  The second is that the FCC would have prohibited unforeseeable future uses of collected data regardless of what consumers actually preferred and businesses may need.  Third, the FCC would also have unjustly applied its heavyhanded approach to broadband providers, treating them more harshly than other players in the internet ecosystem.  In sum, the FCC's broadband privacy protection approach would have rejected free markets and ignored sound economics.  Alternatively, the FTC private enforcement is market oriented and flexible and adaptable to changes in consumer preferences and markets. It also treats companies and players neutrally, fostering an environment of competition and innovation.  This resolution rescinds the FCC's rule, but it does provide the FCC the opportunity to provide oversight more in line with the FTC, which has been successfully regulating online privacy for nearly two decades.  This joint resolution does not lessen or impede privacy and data security standards that have already been established. We are simply restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that consistent, uniform privacy security standards are maintained to protect consumers and future innovation.  Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to cooperating with[[Page H2494]]the FTC to ensure that both consumer privacy across all aspects of the internet is provided through vigorous enforcement and also that innovation is allowed to flourish.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

576,topic-id,360,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  We have heard a lot of interesting claims today in the discussion about this fairly simple resolution to roll back overreaching regulation from the FCC that were passed late in the Obama administration's time.  I would remind everybody, Mr.Speaker, that this CRA has nothing to do with the President's tax return, it has nothing to do with Russian hacking, and there have been some gross mischaracterizations of what this resolution does.  Why do we need this resolution?  The three reasons are, as Chairwoman Blackburn opened up at the beginning:  First of all, the FCC swiped jurisdiction from the  Second, two cops on the beat create confusion among consumers and among the ISP providers.  Third, the FTC already has jurisdiction over this space.  Let me close with this: this resolution of disapproval only rescinds the FCC's rule, but it still provides the FCC the opportunity to provide more oversight more in line with the Federal Trade Commission, which has successfully been regulating online privacy for nearly 2 decades.  This resolution does not lessen or impede the privacy and data security standards that we already have established. We are simply restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that consistent uniform privacy standards are maintained to protect consumers and future innovation.  Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to cooperating with the FTC to ensure both the consumer privacy across all aspects of the internet is protected through vigorous enforcement and that innovation is allowed to flourish.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

1042,topic-id,704,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  This amendment is a commonsense and logical addition to this bill. It will help ensure that members of the EPA's Science Advisory Board will act in the best interests of the American people and our environment.  I think that we can all agree that, now more than ever, we need integrity in government. And this amendment would simply prohibit any member of the EPA's Science Advisory Board from being employed by any entity, corporate or otherwise, which has interests before the This prohibition would be in place during the member's time on the Board and would extend for 3 years after they leave the  My Republican colleagues have taken up this bill with the stated intent of protecting the scientific integrity of the EPA, and this amendment will go a long way to making sure that they keep their word.  The underlying bill also includes a similar prohibition on board members applying for a grant or contract from the EPA during their service or for 3 years after. And as the chairman just said, there is nothing wrong with a financial cooling-off period.  However, the authors of this bill are apparently concerned that members of the Board would be tempted to favor environmental concerns in the hopes of getting an EPA grant. Therefore, it also stands to reason that they should worry equally about a board member tilting the scales in favor of a specific industry in return for future financial compensation or career advancement, the classic revolving door problem.  So what this motion to recommit does is something that I think we all should be able to agree is a good thing. We have seen too many people in the President's Cabinet who appear to have connections too close to the big interests they regulate rather than the interests of the American people.  This amendment would ensure that no one can unduly personally profit from their time at the EPA, and that members are there to represent the interests of the American people and our environment rather than their own self interests.  Finally, I would like to close by bringing up a more general question of why we seem to be having variations on this repetitive theme of whether or not we can pollute our way out of the structural and economic challenges that our country faces.  Mr.Speaker, you and your party have been very successful at selling yourselves and your supporters on the idea that if we can just, once again, dump unlimited pollutants into our rivers and streams, into our groundwater, our food, air, lungs, our bloodstreams and those of our children, then everything will be great again in  This week, we saw our President surrounded by earnest and hopeful young coal miners as he gutted environmental regulations and promised them that all their jobs were coming back. And then we have seen interviews on TV with desperate families in Appalachia using up their life savings to pay for training for underground coal jobs that they have been told will be coming back now that Donald Trump is  Then we have seen interviews with coal executives quietly pointing out that those jobs will not come back; that it was machines and fundamental economic forces that took those jobs in coal country.  The story is the same in oil country, where even as oil production has rebounded, the jobs and wages have not come back because of automation, the same way that machines took the jobs in rural America, manufacturing America, and increasingly middle class, white-collar                              {time}  1000  So until we realize that we are all in this together and that a fundamental restructuring of our economy is needed rather than a mindless retraction of the protections on environmental quality on the land that we will pass on to our children, then I am afraid that we are destined to repeat this infinite loop of marginally productive debate.

682,topic-id,572,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the effort by my Republican colleagues to gut critical consumer privacy protections. Last week, the Senate voted 50 to 48 to allow internet service providers such as Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T to freely collect, share, and sell its customers' private information. Later today, the House will vote on the same measure.  Let's be clear what we are talking about here. From web browsing histories to app usage information, broadband providers have easy access to a whole lot of Americans' personal information. Comcast knows exactly what ails you when you visit WebMD's Symptom Checker or that you have recently experienced a major life event when you are browsing maternity clothes on target.com. They would like the ability to use or sell this information to target advertising toward you, and they would really like to use or sell this information without first having to ask your permission.  Now, for me, the interests of consumers in Minnesota, Texas, and across our country have always come before those of big corporations. That is why I have long championed an internet that is open, accessible, and protects Americans' fundamental rights to privacy. For most Americans, I don't think those are controversial ideas.  For example, I suggest that most if not all of us in the Senate believe in the importance of ensuring that Americans have access to affordable high-speed internet. It is one of those great issues on which Members on both sides of the aisle can agree. See, we all know that Americans' cable and broadband bills are too high. The Consumer Federation of America recently reported that the average American household spends about $2,700 a year for phone, TV, and Internet services. That is why it is so disappointing that instead of acting to make broadband more affordable and more accessible for Americans, my Republican colleagues have actually paved the way for multibillion-dollar companies to make even more money off of their consumers by monetizing some of the most intimate details of their lives. Make no mistake about it, this is purely and simply a corporate handout at the expense of Americans' privacy.  When the FCC voted to pass the broadband privacy rules, the broadband industry was quick to oppose and oppose loudly. In recent months, internet service providers have used their vast resources to lobby the FCC and my fellow lawmakers. If House Republicans heed their call, as my colleagues in the Senate have done, companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will be free to sell their customers' personal information to the highest bidder, and importantly, they will do so without the oversight or regulation of either the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Trade  For my part, I have long held that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. We deserve both transparency and accountability from companies that have the capacity to trade on their private information. Should some people choose to leave their personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible. I am going to keep fighting on behalf of consumers in Minnesota and across the country to secure these rights because I work for them and not the broadband industry.

1239,topic-id,994,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about a path forward on healthcare.  Last week, Republicans in the House failed to pass the American Health Care Act--a deeply flawed policy that amounted to little more than a massive tax break for the wealthy at the expense of working people. The failure of that bill means that, as Speaker Ryan put it, the ACA is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. So today I would like to invite my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to leave repeal efforts behind and instead roll up their sleeves and work with me and other Democrats to improve the system we already have, which is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. It is time to pass commonsense reforms that build on the successes of the ACA and lower healthcare costs.  In a recent HELP Committee hearing, Chairman Alexander said that he wanted to work on a bipartisan basis to stabilize the individual market. Let's do that. We should reinstate and strengthen programs that help insurance companies stay in the marketplace and continue to serve even the sickest patients. We should pass a public option to make sure there is competition in every market. We should provide more tax credits to more people.  While we work on those things, there is something else we should do, something that, together with a group of my colleagues, I introduced a bill about yesterday. It is time to bring down healthcare costs for everyone by reducing the price of prescription drugs. It is time to pass the Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs  I think all of us would agree that no one should have to choose between affording a lifesaving drug and putting food on the table for one's family, but right now that is happening. Companies are setting prices that are beyond the reach of consumers and that are driving up costs for insurers and taxpayers.  One in five Americans says he has not filled a prescription simply because he could not afford it. Others are rationing care due to high prices. A study published just last month found that about 10 percent of cancer patients skipped their medication and about 13 percent delayed filling their prescriptions. We have all been shocked by the stories of EpiPen's prices shooting up nearly 500 percent. The price of insulin has more than doubled in the last 5 years.  Drug companies can essentially set whatever prices they want. As a result, in recent years, drug companies have secured some of the highest profit margins of any industry.  Drug prices are too high. That is why my colleagues and I are introducing comprehensive legislation to tackle prescription drug prices. We want to make sure companies cannot exploit the sick and dying to make a profit. The bill includes 17 policy changes that will improve transparency, promote affordability, spur innovation, and enhance competition. Today, I would like to highlight just three of those provisions.  First, transparency. This legislation requires drug companies to disclose how much they spend on research, manufacturing, and marketing, as well as research grants from the Federal Government, to help all of us understand why prices for lifesaving drugs are so high. It is especially galling that so many drugs that are developed with taxpayer dollars are unaffordable for so many Getting this information would help all of us hold drug companies accountable, and that can be an important step toward bringing prices down.  Second--something that President Trump called for on the campaign trail--the bill will allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. It is just common sense that the biggest buyer of pharmaceutical products in America should be able to use its negotiating clout to bring prices down.  Third, the bill would end the practice of so-called pay-for-delay. Right now, drug companies that make the expensive brand-name drugs will pay other companies that make generic alternatives to keep their products off the market. This is called pay-for-delay. It is outrageous, and it is increasingly common. This bill will stop these agreements once and for all.  There is a lot more that this bill does. It penalizes companies that price-gouge for lifesaving medicine, and I think we can all agree on that. It puts a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs in insurance plans. It speeds up generic competition. It funds new innovation and includes a number of other provisions.  Tackling the high cost of prescription drugs is an issue many of my colleagues care deeply about. This bill reflects many of their ideas and proposals, and I am grateful for their work with me. Moreover, it is obvious that the public is ready for action on this issue. Overwhelming majorities of Americans in both parties support government action to curb out-of-control drug prices.  I am eager to hear from colleagues on both sides of the aisle and from the administration about how we can work together to pass the reforms into law. This is an area of health policy that Democrats are eager to work on, and we hope the President will stand by his promise to stand up to drug companies and reduce costs for American families. It is morally wrong that some people are denied access to lifesaving drugs because they cannot afford them, and it is something we can fix.  I am in the Senate so that I can fight for policies that improve people's lives. That is why I am here. With this bill, I am trying to do exactly that. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in helping to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2146.txt,1969,HONORING SERVICE OF DR. THOM MASON,2017.0,30.0,March

For all of the rhetoric about freedom and choices, this bill sends a clear message to every American as to where Republican priorities lie. Tax breaks to the wealthy have been deemed more valuable than lifesaving care.  They are telling hardworking families that insurance that only benefits the wealthy, the healthy, and the young is more important than access to nursing homes, to pediatric care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and the overall peace of mind that, if you get sick, you can afford care.  Speaker Ryan calls this ``an act of mercy.'' This is by no means merciful, Mr.Mercy is caring for the sick, the poor, for our elders. Mercy is extending a hand to those in need. This is heartless.

40,topic-id,1294,"Mr.Speaker, people in my home State of Hawaii and all across the country are in desperate need of serious healthcare reform to bring down costs and increase access to quality care.  The legislation before us, though, is not the answer. It perpetuates the problems. It is a handout to insurance and pharmaceutical companies that literally pulls the rug out from those who are most needy and most vulnerable in our communities.  While corporations rake in over $600 billion in tax breaks, many low-income Americans will see their coverage drop completely.  Medicaid, a program that one in five Americans depend on for basic care, would be slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars, shifting costs to already-strained State and local governments.  Our kupuna, our seniors, could see their premiums increase up to five times more than young, healthy people under these new age rating rules in this bill.  Simply put, we need a healthcare system that puts people before profits. I urge my colleagues strongly to vote ``no'' against this legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO score for the underlying bill and the first four manager's amendments. We just got it last night, and it is already out-of-date given the fifth manager's amendment that was just submitted late last night.                                                    U.Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,                Dear Mr.Speaker: At your request, the Congressional Budget      Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)      have prepared an estimate of the direct spending and revenue      effects of H.1628, the American Health Care Act, as posted      on the website of the House Committee on Rules on March 22,      2017, incorporating manager's amendments 4, 5, 24, and 25.       As a result of those amendments, this estimate shows      smaller savings over the next 10 years than the estimate that      CBO issued on March 13 for the reconciliation recommendations      of the House Committee on Ways and Means and the House      Committee on Energy and The estimated effects on      health insurance coverage and on premiums for health      insurance are similar to those estimated for the committees'      recommendations.                     Effects on the Federal Budget       CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.1628, with the      proposed amendments, would reduce federal deficits by $150      billion over the 2017-2026 period; that reduction is the net      result of a $1,150 billion reduction in direct spending,      partly offset by a reduction of $999 billion in revenues (see      Tables 1 and 2). The provisions dealing with health insurance      coverage would reduce deficits, on net, by $883 billion (see      Table 3); the noncoverage provisions would increase deficits      by $733 billion, mostly by reducing revenues.       Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the      legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO      and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would not      increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of      the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027.                  Effects on Health Insurance Coverage       CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people      would be uninsured under the legislation than under current      law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative      to the number under current law would reach 21 million in      2020 and 24 million in 2026 (see Table 4). In 2026, an      estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured,      compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year      under current law.                          Effects on Premiums       H.1628, with the proposed amendments, would tend to      increase average premiums in the nongroup market before 2020      and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to      projections under current law. In 2018 and 2019, according to      CBO and JCT's estimates, average premiums for single      policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to      20 percent higher under the legislation than under current      law. By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in      the nongroup market would be roughly 10 percent lower than      under current law.                 Uncertainty Surrounding the Estimates       The ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers,      employers, individuals, doctors, hospitals, and other      affected parties would respond to the changes made by the      legislation are all difficult to predict, so the estimates in      this report are uncertain. But CBO and JCT have endeavored to      develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution      of potential outcomes.                 Comparison With the Previous Estimate       On March, 13, 2017, CBO and JCT estimated that enacting the      reconciliation recommendations of the House Committee on Ways      and Means and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce      (which were combined into H.1628) would yield a net      reduction in federal deficits of $337 billion over the 2017-     2026 period. CBO estimates that enacting H.1628, with the      proposed amendments, would save $186 billion less over that      period. That reduction in savings stems primarily from      changes to H.1628 that modify provisions affecting the      Internal Revenue Code and the Medicaid program.       Over the 2017-2026 period, modifications to provisions      affecting the Internal Revenue Code that are not directly      related to the law's insurance coverage provisions would      reduce JCT's estimate of revenues by $137 billion. Reducing      the threshold for determining the medical care deduction on      individuals' income tax returns from 7.5 percent of income to      5.8 percent would reduce revenues by about $90 billion. Other      changes include adjusting the effective dates and making      other modifications to the provisions that repeal or delay      many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, which would      reduce revenues by $48 billion.       A number of changes to the Medicaid program would reduce      CBO's estimate of savings by $41 billion over the 2017-2026      period. The reduction would result from revising the formula      for calculating the per capita allotments in Medicaid to      allow for faster growth of the per capita cost of aged,      blind, and disabled enrollees. The effects of changing that      formula would be offset somewhat by the effects of three      other provisions that would increase savings: reducing the      per capita allotment in Medicaid for the state of New York in      proportion to any financing the state receives from county      governments; providing states the option to make eligibility      for Medicaid conditional on satisfying work requirements for      enrollees who are not single parents of children under age 6      or who are not pregnant or disabled; and allowing states to      receive a block grant for Medicaid coverage of children and      some adults instead of funding based on a per capita cap.       Other smaller changes resulting from the manager's      amendments would reduce savings by an estimated $8 billion      over the period.       Compared with the previous version of the legislation, H.     1628, with the proposed amendments, would have similar      effects on health insurance coverage: Estimates differ by no      more than half a million people in any category in any year      over the next decade. (Some differences may appear larger      because of rounding.) For example, the decline in Medicaid      coverage after 2020 would be smaller than in the previous      estimate, mainly because of states' responses to the faster      growth in the per capita allotments for aged, blind, and      disabled enrollees--but other changes in Medicaid would      offset some of those effects.       The legislation's impact on health insurance premiums would      be approximately the same as estimated for the previous      version.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them.

It is one of the great privileges of being an Yet for far too many around the world, freedom of conscience is still a distant dream.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in Russia, where Vladimir Putin's thuggish regime has poisoned the promise of the post-Soviet era and day by day has slid Russia back into the dark shadows of autocracy. Just last Sunday, thousands of Russians took to the streets and squares in protest of the Kremlin's corruption. And in return, Russian police arrested hundreds of protesters, including Vladimir Putin's political challenger, Alexei  But the Putin regime's barbarity isn't just a polite policy difference. Russians of exceptional courage are dying, including as recently as last week, as the regime cultivates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.  Vladimir Putin's campaign of murder is not limited to domestic political opponents. Like all dictators, Putin seeks to rally his nation's support by channeling public fear and anger against external enemies.

As recent as last night, the commander of CENTCOM announced that Russia is likely providing support to the Taliban in  Mr.Speaker, I am afraid we have exhausted our warnings. Russian aggression, if left unchecked, may soon cross a line past which there is no return.  You see, what Vladimir Putin wants is fundamentally at odds with American interests. After the Second World War, America laid the foundation for a new and better world, drawn together by common values and forged from the fires of war. We did this not just because we are a generous people but because we are a wise people.  Farsighted American statesmen realized that creating the architecture for peace in Europe was a far better investment than returning to isolationism and then one day having to pay the butcher's bill, as we did twice during the first half of the 20th century.  As Europe is changing, Vladimir Putin dreams of restoring the Soviet Union's prestige and power, and his ultimate goal is clear: the end of the postwar-American project in Europe and the return of power politics unencumbered by the rules of the road that we established to our benefit in concert with our allies.  And so the stakes, in my mind, could not be any higher. If we do not stand up to Putin now, his aggression will continue until one day he goes too far. On that day, we may face an unimaginable choice between war or the destruction of the NATO alliance. And whichever we choose, we will have lost.  Despite Putin telling us exactly who he is, I have heard some say we should try to work with Russia to find areas of common ground. Yet we have seen firsthand how the last administration's reset has not led to better relations but to a tide of Russian aggression.  I do not believe Putin desires war with the United What he desires is the fruits of conquest without the cost. He holds the cards of a bluffer, and he is gradually raising the stakes in an effort to get us to fold. Fortunately, it is the U.S., not Russia, who holds the stronger hand. We cannot, and we must not, give Putin the acquiescence he requires to succeed in his plot to overturn the world we created.  When it comes to Russia's interference in our elections, we must put the country and the sanctity of our democracy far above partisan interests. For any American to collaborate against our own government with a government that seeks to undermine our country would, indeed, be nothing short of treasonous.

Research pays in better lives, in people living longer and the quality of their life. And yet this 18 percent reduction that has been proposed by the President in the basic funding for medical research here in the United States goes directly against these very important and very impressive changes in the statistics about mortality--HIV/AIDS, 52 percent.

It is unconscionable that such a proposal would be brought to the House of  We are going to go beyond these success stories, and we are going to talk about this purple line here. The deaths from Alzheimer's have actually increased by 71 percent in the same 13-year period, in part due to the fact that the population, the baby boomers and those that preceded them, grow old; and that is where Alzheimer's occurs, in the older age groups.  So what is the research funding here on Alzheimer's? Well, not so good.  But before I go to that, I just want to take one moment and draw your attention to this little chart. This is the funding level for the National Institutes of Health's projected budget: $31.7 billion. The scientists, the researchers out there said that that is underfunding not from their wish list, but from viable, credible research programs that can't be paid for because they have run out of money. So they have suggested that the budget should be somewhere around $35 billion.  So what does the President propose? Well, he proposes, instead of going up, going down to $25 billion or just close to $26 billion, $5.6 billion less.  The result is that this is not going to come down.

His knowledge and expertise in this field is appreciated and, I am sure when shared with the other Members of this House, will have a positive result.  Mr.Peters said something toward the end of his conversation that I think we need to drive home. I said earlier that the scientists suggested that instead of a $31.7 billion budget for the NIH, they needed an additional $3.3 billion. It is for those projects that Mr.Peters described as peer-reviewed by peers in the area of science--whether it is heart disease, cancer, or HIV or Alzheimer's--that are worthy projects for which there is no money.  If we could fund those--not reduce the level of funding, as suggested by the President, but, rather, increase it--what would be the result?  I am going to toss this up one more time. This is what happens when research is applied to diseases. Breast cancer down, prostate cancer down, heart disease deaths, strokes, and HIV, all down as a result of research, and then the application of that research through the medical community.

613,topic-id,718,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Raskin so very much. And, indeed, the National Institutes of Health has a stellar representative, as do the American people, and certainly the people of  As he told his own personal story of one of the dreaded diseases, I am delighted to see him stand here in such good health. Apparently, he has recovered completely from that.  I suspect that recovery was, at least in part, due to, first, his good health at the outset, but also to the research that was done in the preceding years through the National Institutes of Health on cancer research. We have seen the decline in cancer deaths as a result of that research. What we would like to do is to deal with this Alzheimer's.  I want to take a moment just to talk about where we are. We had a huge debate last week on repealing the Affordable Care Act and what it would mean to Americans, and a lot of that debate centered around the cost of medical services. Tragically, one of the ways that the proponents of repealing the Affordable Care Act would save money is to reduce the Medicaid program in different ways, but the end result was to reduce the Medicaid program.  Sixty percent of the Medicaid program is for people in long-term care facilities. A good percentage of those, probably the majority of those, with some sort of dementia or Alzheimer's. What we need to do is to address this issue straightforward.  I will tell my own story.  My mother-in-law lived the last 3 years of her life in our home. We were in a position where we were able to take care of her, so she didn't go to a long-term care facility. Nonetheless, it was one of the obligations that we felt we had, and many, many other Americans share that obligation.  This is 2015. The number $2.026 billion came up during the discussion that we had. That is what we spent in 2016. Some of that was spent by other payors. That would be insurance companies. Some was spent by family. Medicare and Medicaid spent the great majority.  As we go through the years, in 2020, we expect to spend $267 billion. And again, Medicare and Medicaid make up the great majority of it. As we move through time, we will see that there will be greater and greater expenses, rising year by year, so that in the year 2050, which is not that far away--that is one generation away--we will be spending over $1 trillion, and Medicare and Medicaid will, throughout this entire period, be the single largest source of money to pay for Alzheimer's.  So, if we want to reduce the cost of premiums, if we want to reduce the cost of government, if we want to deal[[Page H2510]]with the quality of life of Americans, then we have to get to this research because there is hope. Alzheimer's is not a hopeless disease. It is not a disease for which there is no cure. It is a disease for which we have not spent money on finding the cure.  If we can delay by a year, we will save tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money in care that has been pushed off into the future. And the quality of life for the individual that has one more year of quality of life ahead of them is enormous and invaluable.  Here is just a way of depicting the backward nature of how we are dealing with the research for Alzheimer's. This was originally the 2015. We have been at this a couple of years, and we have seen progress.  In 2016, we spent $941 million, just under $1 billion, on Alzheimer's research. At the same time, we spent $153 billion in the care of Alzheimer's in Medicare and It is Federal taxpayer money.  Look, $1 billion, less than $1 billion in research, $153 billion in out-of-pocket expense caring for these individuals that have come down with Alzheimer's. A pretty neat equation here, isn't it?  If we were to ramp that up, as we would like to see, from $941 million to $1.4 billion, the researchers all across this country--some in San Diego, as we heard from Mr.Scott Peters; others in New Jersey, as we heard from ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2505-6.txt,1973,WAUSAU-AREA TRAGEDY,2017.0,28.0,March

686,topic-id,1360,"Mr.President, I wanted to come to the floor again to express my strong support for a very mainstream, well-qualified nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil  Last week, this country got to watch the Senate Judiciary Committee carry out days of hearings that questioned and probed Judge Gorsuch's legal approach, that questioned his temperament to the bench, his suitability to be on our Nation's High I believe every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee had at least an hour to question Judge Gorsuch, to provide lengthy opening statements, to have an extended period of time to have a back-and-forth with Judge Gorsuch in order to go over his judicial philosophy--his approach--that he would take with him from the Tenth Circuit Court to the Nation's High  A number of interest groups and personal witnesses were talking about whether or not they believe Judge Gorsuch is qualified for the bench, and some were highly favorable and spoke very highly of him, and others opposed his confirmation. That is what is great about this country--to be able to come before our Congress, our government, and to testify for or against somebody who will be in that third important branch of government, the judicial branch. It is incredibly inspiring to watch this process unfold. There were student groups around the country, classes and teachers, who were watching the confirmation hearing as a project, as an educational experience, as a lesson in civics, democracy, and government.  I mentioned, of course, that Judge Gorsuch is a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court today. He is a fourth generation He was confirmed to that position in 2006, 11 years ago, unanimously. He was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court 11 years ago unanimously. Based on some of the comments we have heard opposing Judge Gorsuch, it is hard to believe that anybody would have supported him unanimously 11 years ago--based on the things we have heard from the other side of the aisle about him. Judge Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by 12 current Democratic Senators who did not oppose his confirmation 11 years ago and who serve in this body today.  Twelve Democratic Senators serve in this Chamber today who agreed with his confirmation or didn't oppose his confirmation 11 years ago. In fact, not a single Democrat opposed his nomination--not a single one, and his nomination was unanimous--not Minority Leader Schumer, not Senator Leahy, not Senator Feinstein, not Senator Durbin, not Senator Cantwell, not Senator Carper, not Senator Menendez, not Senator Murray, not Senator Nelson, not Senator Reid, not Senator Stabenow, and not Senator Judge Gorsuch's nomination also was not opposed by then-Senator Barack It was not opposed by then-Senator Joe Biden, and it was not opposed by then-Senator Hillary  This level of support for the other party's nomination is almost unheard of in today's political climate. But now, these very same colleagues are vowing to break 230 years of Senate tradition, to dispense with 230 years of precedent, and to join a partisan filibuster of a nominee who has the right judicial temperament and holds mainstream views that are supported by the  Throughout the confirmation hearing process, we heard Judge Gorsuch talk about the over 2,000 opinions that he was a part of--2,700 decisions that he was a part of--and I believe he testified before the committee that he joined in the majority in 97 percent of those opinions. That is somebody who sounds to me like the person who could have received the unanimous support of the Senate--who did receive the unanimous support of the Senate, including colleagues who serve with us today.  But, unfortunately, across the aisle, we still haven't heard a reason articulated--a compelling rationale--for why this supremely qualified nominee should be opposed. Sometimes they will reference a letter from a law student at the University of Colorado, or perhaps they will find one case out of the 2,700 cases that tugs at the heartstrings but not at the law and try to hang their hat on that decision as to why they should oppose Judge To use a baseball analogy, it is a little bit like a batting average. You would think that a professional baseball player that had a 400 batting average was a pretty doggone good baseball player, but that would mean they missed the ball a heck of a lot much of the time. It seems to me the argument they are making with Judge Gorsuch is that unless he had a perfect batting average and never missed a single pitch and had a hit every single time--that is the standard, apparently, that our colleagues are looking for. It is a standard that no one has ever met in this country before.  We are looking for mainstream judges with the right temperament and the right philosophy, and that is what Judge Gorsuch has proven time and again in the Tenth Circuit Court--that temperament that we need on the highest  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle should abandon their threats of a filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote to occur for Judge It is what Senate tradition and precedent requires.  Today, though, I thought it important to talk about Judge Gorsuch's exceptionally strong record on religious liberty. Judge Gorsuch is perhaps widely known for his participation in the Tenth Circuit's Hobby Lobby case, a decision which involved the protections afforded by the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act and which was ultimately affirmed by the Supreme In his concurrence, Judge Gorsuch made a number of telling pronouncements regarding religious liberty. Regarding the case, he wrote that the law in question requires the owners of Hobby Lobby to ``violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong.''  Let me say that again. In Hobby Lobby, Judge Gorsuch wrote that the law requires the owners of Hobby Lobby to ``violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong.''  In determining which religious beliefs are entitled to protection, Judge Gorsuch said it doesn't matter if the beliefs are contestable or even offensive. It only matters if they are sincerely held--if they are sincerely held.  He went on to stress that ``it is not the place of courts of law to question the correctness or the consistency of tenets of religious faith, only to protect the exercise of faith.''  It is these same constitutional principles of religious liberty that Judge Gorsuch has also used to protect religious minorities and prison inmates.  In Yellowbear v. Lampert, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a Native American prisoner was entitled to the use of a prison sweat lodge under Federal law.[[Page S2032]]  Judge Gorsuch went on to stress that while prisoners give up many liberties, the freedom to sincerely express their religion is not one of them. His reasoning was later adopted by the Supreme Court to extend similar religious liberty protections to a Muslim prisoner. Judge Sotomayor even quoted the opinion of Judge Gorsuch in her concurrence in that case.  From his opinions, it is clear that Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream nominee who understands the importance of putting personal beliefs aside and applying the law as written. This is why George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley argued that Judge Gorsuch shouldn't be penalized for his past opinions. As he said, ``the jurisprudence reflect, not surprisingly, a jurist who crafts his decisions very close to the text of a statute and, in my view, that is no vice for a federal judge.''  It is for the reasons I have cited today and for the reasons we have seen over the past week that I am certain Judge Gorsuch will make Colorado proud and that his decisions will have a positive impact on the Supreme Court and this country for generations to come.  I look forward to working with my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expeditiously confirm his nomination and to make sure that we uphold the best traditions and the precedent of this  Mr.President, thank you.

934,topic-id,2147,"Madam President, I rise to talk about the continuing challenge that our agricultural communities face across this country.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I came to the floor and cited a Wall Street Journal article with the headline: ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us.'' Living in eastern Colorado, in a purely 100 percent agricultural community, I understand that when there is a downturn in the ag economy, it does not affect businesses on Main Street later that week or later that month; it affects them that very same day. He is not just somebody who is going in to buy a bag of seed or somebody who is going to the local implement dealer to buy a tractor. He is somebody who decides he is not going to be able to buy that pair of blue jeans that he thought he would or that piece of equipment he needed to help fix the fence. It means that the entire economy in towns like Yuma, CO, Burlington, CO, and Dove Creek, CO, are going to suffer enormously. That is why it is important that we continue the conversation in the U.Senate about what is happening in agriculture across this country.  I recognize that many people, when they think of Colorado, probably do not think of farms and ranches on the flatlands and prairies. They probably think more of Kansas for that than they do If you look at Colorado, it is more than just snowcapped peaks; it is incredible agricultural diversity as well.  According to the 2016 National Agricultural Statistics Survey, Colorado ranks in the top 10 in production for the following agriculture commodities: barley, beans, sweet corn, alfalfa, potatoes, millet, sorghum, sunflowers, wheat, cabbage, cantaloupe, onions, cattle, lamb, and wool. Colorado is one of the top 10 producers in those commodities. It is a remarkable list that shows the diversity of Colorado from the plains to the mountains and the incredible production levels that we have achieved.  One of the goals I have had in the Senate, of course, is to help make sure that we have the right policies to support our farmers and ranchers throughout Colorado who are producing everything from barley to potatoes. I want to make sure that we work to add even more crops to this list of the top 10 in order to strengthen the agricultural industry in  As I mentioned a few weeks ago when I came to the floor to talk about that crisis, the Wall Street Journal article highlighted a story from a farmer in I recently talked to a farmer in eastern Colorado who is getting paid $3.21 for a bushel of corn, but to pay the bills, his break-even point on that bushel of corn--the amount of money that it took to make that corn bushel--was $3.92 cents. So he was getting paid $3.21, and it cost him $3.92. That is not the right side of an equation to be on if you are in business and, particularly, if you are hoping to pass that business on to future generations.  I think it is important that the Senate talk about commodity prices and that we talk about the impact that increased Federal regulations have had which make it more difficult for that farmer to survive, that have driven up the cost of doing business, that have driven up the cost that you need to be paid per bushel of corn so that you can help make ends meet.  I talk about barriers to exports and limited financing options. Those are four things that we have to lay out--commodity prices--and deal with. We have to make sure that we are decreasing the number of Federal regulations. We have to make sure that we remove barriers to export and allow agriculture to export. We have to make sure that we are removing any obstacles to the financing that a farmer or a rancher may have, particularly if the economy continues to deteriorate in our countryside, and we have to make sure that we have certainty in ag policy and certainty in regulations. The farm bill conversations continue. Let's make sure that we provide the certainty to our ag communities that they deserve and, quite frankly, demand.  According to the 2017 Colorado Business Economic Outlook--and this is an incredible statistic--net farm and ranch incomes are projected to be down almost 80 percent since the records that were set in 2011. By 80 percent, net farm and ranch incomes are projected to be down. An 80 percent drop in just a few years is devastating for rural communities. I believe the exact numbers in Colorado are something like going from $1.8 billion in farm income to a little over $300 million in farm income just over a matter of a few years.  While we have done a good job of addressing regulatory concerns, we have to make sure that we are doing a good job of addressing continued trade opportunities in this country as well. Corn and wheat prices are hitting 10-year lows. The price is so low that it costs farmers more to produce the crop, as I mentioned, than it is worth on the market. You do not have to be an economist to figure out that that is not going to let you stay in business for much longer.  Simply put, we have a lot of people who are worried in Colorado and across this country for agriculture and our rural communities, which are dependent on their farms and ranches. The Presiding Officer is from the great State of Iowa--a leader in this country when it comes to agriculture. Whether you live in the Eastern Plains of Colorado or in the great State of Iowa, the fact is we have to provide that leadership on a global stage to make sure that our ag communities survive and thrive.  Earlier this year, I sent a letter to the Colorado Farm Bureau that solicited feedback on what Congress and the Federal Government could do to support Colorado agriculture. In their response, I received a number of recommendations from the Colorado Farm Bureau and a number of organizations that they reached out to to respond to my request and my question.  On the list, of course, was regulatory reform--one of the four pillars that we have to address in order to have successful agriculture in this country. Their concern is that overregulation creates uncertainty in regulations like the waters of the United States and the BLM 2.0 rules.  The good news is that, with regard to both of these rules, we have been able to roll them back. According to the Colorado Farm Bureau, the waters of the United States regulation threatened to add additional regulatory compliance requirements to thousands of stream miles and thousands of acres of agricultural land.  To put that in layman's terms, it basically would have said: Hey, you, the Federal Government, you are in charge of every molecule of water.  That is not good for agriculture. Thankfully, the administration has said: No, we are going to stop that, and we are going to repeal it. Courts across this country had actually put in stays.  The Presiding Officer from the great State of Iowa--our colleague, Joni Ernst--was a leader when it came to stopping the waters of the United States regulation. Luckily, we have seen that regulation being stopped in its tracks.  In Colorado, two-thirds of waterways were identified as what is known as[[Page S2069]]``intermittent flow.'' That means that they do not have water in them year round, that, part of the year, they are dry. Yet they would have been subject to a regulation known as the waters of the United States, even though they did not have water in them. That is the absurdity of the Federal So I am glad that we are able to start rolling back these regulations.  At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management had started a process known as its BLM 2.0 rulemaking process, which is a rule that they had issued that they thought would deal with complex permitting issues and land use decisions. Unfortunately, what this rule would have done instead is take away access to thousands of acres of Federal land that were used for grazing. Even more disturbing, it would have given somebody in downtown New York City just as much say over the land in Moffat County, CO, as a Moffat County commissioner--somebody who lives there--amongst various agencies in the Federal Government that oversee thousands of acres of public lands. That, too, was overturned by the U. In fact, if you look at the total number of regulations that the administration and that the U.Congress has been able to overturn, we are approaching $60 billion worth of regulatory relief that we have been able to give to the American people; $60 billion worth of regulations have been taken off the backs of hard-working Americans and has allowed them to do their jobs easier, allowed them to make ends meet easier, allowed them to breathe easier when it comes to job creation and job opportunity.  I am very glad that we saw the BLM 2.0 rule repealed, which gives our people in Colorado a little bit more of a chance to have a say in what happens in their front yards and their backyards. Of course, the waters of the United States has to continue to be something that we stop as we move forward.  There are other positive steps we should take to give our producers additional regulatory certainty. I know there is more that we can do, and I hope to hear from our Nation's farmers and ranchers and our farmers and ranchers in Colorado on how Congress and the Federal Government can help.  So I use this opportunity to make an appeal to people across the country in order to hear from farmers and ranchers, whether you are in the Eastern Plains of Colorado or on the Western Slope of Colorado or in the great State of Iowa or Kansas or anywhere in between and outside the State of Colorado--inside and outside--of the things that we can be doing, such as with trade policy, regulatory policy, financial services opportunities, making sure we have farm bill programs that are working. Back in my office, we want to hear about these ideas and about thoughts moving forward on these important issues so that we can have an agricultural community that thrives and so that we can make sure that, when we talk about bringing generations of farmers and ranchers back to the farm and the ranch, we will get their ideas on how best to do that.  This week, I will be sending letters to the Colorado Agriculture Council, which is made up of organizations across the agricultural spectrum in Colorado, as well as to Don Brown, who is the commissioner of the Colorado Department of Agriculture, on what else Congress and the Federal Government can do to help support this industry. Also, there is Julie McCaleb, the Colorado Agriculture Council chair.  Basically, I will be writing: Hey, whether it is regulations or legislation, it is important that the administration and Congress understand the impact their policies will have on agriculture. I look forward to hearing from you, your member organizations, and farmers and ranchers throughout the State on how we can work together to ensure Colorado agriculture continues to be effectively represented in  We will be sending this letter, of course, to Commissioner Don Commissioner Brown is from my hometown. He is a corn farmer and a cattleman. He is somebody who understands firsthand the hard work and challenges that go into making ends meet in agriculture. He also understands the suffering that we are seeing in the farmland right now and that some people may be at their wits' end in terms of trying to deal with their financial struggles.  We will be sending these letters out. I encourage people--farmers, ranchers, and leaders in counties--to contact my office and give us their ideas on how we can turn this ``could be coming'' crisis around so that we can actually start improving and growing agriculture again and so that we can make sure that we lead Colorado's diverse agricultural economy into a better state than it is today--in a better place than it is today--in terms of the economy.  Here, in the Senate, I believe that same bipartisan support exists for all of us to be reaching out to our communities and making sure that we hear from the heartland of America what we can do to help struggling farmers and ranchers.

944,topic-id,2055,"Mr.President, I come to the floor once again today to talk about the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  In the 235 years of our Nation's history with the Constitution, there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court What I mean by that is this: No Supreme Court nominee has ever been rejected by a partisan filibuster on the floor of the Now, sure, we can argue about the 1968 bipartisan attempt to make sure that then-Associate Justice Abe Fortas wasn't elevated to the Chief Justice position.  What this Chamber is facing today isn't a question of whether we will abide by the Biden rule. The Biden rule, of course, was when Joe Biden said: During the last term of the outgoing President, when the office is up for election, we are not going to confirm any nominees. This isn't an argument over whether Chuck Schumer was right when Senator Chuck Schumer said: Heck, over the last couple of years of the Bush administration, we are not going to allow a Justice to be confirmed.  That is not what we are arguing about today. We are arguing about whether a brilliant legal mind, a judge who has proven incredible legal temperament over the last several months since his nomination, a judge who has agreed 97 percent of the time with the majority decisions of the court, should receive an up-or-down vote.  Have no doubt that this is a historic opportunity for this Chamber to come together to prove that we believe in that 230-year precedent of confirming Supreme Court This is an opportunity we have to come together on a judge who just 11 years ago was confirmed unanimously by voice vote. There was no opposition 11 years ago to Judge Gorsuch when he was confirmed to be placed on the Tenth Circuit Court, which is based in Now, the Denver-based court, the Tenth Circuit Court, covers about 20 percent of our Nation's land mass. It is a huge, huge area. This is a court that deals with public lands cases. This is a court that deals with water issues, complex public lands issues, and Tribal issues. This is a judge who has been a part of 2,700 opinions, voting 97 percent of the time with the majority of the court.  Now, the majority of the court aren't all George Bush or George H.Bush or Ronald Reagan nominees. The nominees in the Tenth Circuit Court are bipartisan justices. It is filled with Democratic and Republican appointees. That is the Tenth Circuit Court, with whom Judge Gorsuch has worked. Judge Gorsuch has been somebody known as a feeder judge. A feeder judge is somebody that the Supreme Court--when they are looking to select clerks to help the Justices do their work--looks to, like Judge Gorsuch, to provide them with law clerks to help them at the Supreme They do that because he is an incredible and outstanding jurist, somebody who has the respect on both sides of the aisle, Republican and That is why he is a feeder judge. That is why he was confirmed 11 years ago by a bipartisan body of  In the last couple of weeks, we have seen days' worth of hearings where each Senator has been able to speak for an hour or so, questioning Judge Gorsuch, days' worth of hearings where the American people witnessed as Judge Gorsuch laid out his legal philosophy and his temperament, and where he displayed the even temperament we need on a Supreme Court--the kind of temperament that not only is able to work with colleagues but understand complex legal cases. And 11 years ago his confirmation was so noncontroversial that when it came to his confirmation, Senator Lindsey Graham was the only one who showed up. He was the only one at the confirmation hearing. That is how noncontroversial it was. What a difference a court makes.  Now, let's talk about some of the Senators who supported him, or at least didn't object to him, 11 years ago. Then, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer didn't oppose Judge Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit Senator Leahy, a member of the Judiciary Committee, did not object to Judge Senator Feinstein, another member of the Judiciary Committee, didn't oppose Neil Senator Durbin, the minority whip, did not oppose Judge Neil Gorsuch 11 years ago. Senator Cantwell, Senator Carper, Senator Menendez, Senator Murray--none of them opposed Judge Gorsuch's confirmation to the Tenth Circuit Senator Nelson, Senator Reed, Senator Stabenow, Senator Wyden--all of them here today. None of them objected to Neil  It is even more than that. Then-Senator Barack Obama did not object to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Then-Senator Hillary Clinton didn't object to Judge Gorsuch's nomination. Then-Senator Joe Biden helped pass his confirmation, his appointment, and made sure it cleared on a voice vote.  To hear the partisan bickering here is extremely disappointing and disingenuous. So I hope this Chamber will do what we do best in this country, and that is to come together on issues of doing our job of confirming a Supreme Court Justice after spending the past several months complaining that the Supreme Court wasn't filled.  This judge should receive bipartisan support, as he did 11 years ago. I guess the question has to be asked of people who are now opposing Judge Gorsuch today, who either supported or did not object to him 11 years ago: Did they not do their work 11 years ago? Did they not realize he was a bad judge? Or has the time of politics changed? Or are we just dealing with a President whom they have decided they don't want to have a Supreme Court Justice from? I guess that is what has perhaps changed the most over the past 11 years, because there is not really a narrative we can point to for a reason of why they should oppose him, other[[Page S2079]]than people just deciding that the politics of the now require it, and that is incredibly disappointing.  If we look at Judge Gorsuch's statements, he talks about Justice Scalia's vision of the good and faithful judge. I think it is a worthy one that we focus on because of what it means to Judge Gorsuch--soon to be Justice Gorsuch--to be a good and faithful judge:       It seems to me that the separation of legislative and      judicial powers isn't just a formality dictated by the      Neither is it just about ensuring that two      institutions with basically identical functions are balanced      one against the other.       To the founders, the legislative and judicial powers were      distinct by nature and their separation was among the most      important liberty-protecting devices of constitutional      design, an independent right of the people essential to the      preservation of all other rights later enumerated in the      Constitution and its amendments.       Now consider . . . if we allowed the judge to act like a      legislature. Unconstrained by the bicameralism and      presentment hurdles of Article I, the judge would need only      his own vote, or those of just a few colleagues, to revise      the law willy-nilly in accordance with his preferences and      the task of legislating would become a relatively simple      thing.       Notice, too, how hard it would be to revise this so-easily-     made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world      or to fix mistakes. Unable to throw judges out of office in      regular elections, you'd have to wait for them to die before      you'd have any chance of change. And even then you'd find      change difficult, for courts cannot so easily undo their      errors given the weight they afford precedent.       Notice finally how little voice the people would be left in      a government where life-appointed judges are free to      legislate alongside elected representatives.       The very idea of self-government would seem to wither to      the point of pointlessness.       Indeed, it seems that for reasons just like these Hamilton      explained that ``liberty can have nothing to fear from the      judiciary alone,'' but that it ``ha[s] everything to fear      from [the] union'' of the judicial and legislative powers. .      . .  That is the explanation that Judge Gorsuch has given to Justice Scalia's good and faithful judge--a judge who believes that the judicial branch is the guardian of the Constitution to take a decision or a question before them to the place the law leads them to, not to the place where politics sends them or politics demands them or personal opinions and beliefs dictate.  We have heard Judge Gorsuch say he believes that a judge who personally believes or agrees with every opinion he reaches is probably a bad judge. It is because Judge Gorsuch knows that once you put on the robe, you don't follow your personal opinion. You follow the law. That is the guarding of the Constitution that the Federalist Papers talked about.  So that is the kind of nominee we are dealing with--a nominee who understands the separation of powers and who understands the role of the judiciary, the role of the legislative branch, and the role of the executive. In fact, he believes that the executive branch has been empowered too greatly and that we should once again have separate but equal branches of government balanced in power.  I think that is a good judge to place on the Court--a judge who is clearly mainstream, a judge who clearly has the temperament to work with colleagues to make our country proud.  Certainly as a fourth-generation Coloradan, I am very excited Judge Gorsuch has been nominated by the In addition to the bipartisan support Judge Gorsuch received here 11 years ago, he also has tremendous bipartisan support back home in In fact, I have a letter here from Jim Lyons, who was a personal friend and lawyer for President Bill It is a letter to Senator Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated February 7, 2017.       I write this letter in strong support of the nomination and      confirmation of Neil Gorsuch for Associate Justice of the      Supreme  He ends his letter with this:       Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy and deep regard for the      Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked      with him and seen first-hand his commitment to basic      principles. Above all, his independence, fairness and      impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-     earned reputation.  The former Governor of Colorado, Democrat Bill Ritter, supports the confirmation of Judge Neil  Eleven years ago, then-Senator Ken Salazar spoke very highly of his temperament, saying in 2006 that Judge Gorsuch met the ``very high test'' required of someone to be a ``great judge'' and that he has ``demonstrated a dedication to fairness, impartiality, precedent and avoidance of judicial activism--from both the left and the right.''  The Denver Post editorial board, which came out in support of Hillary Clinton, argued for Neil Gorsuch's nomination, saying: ``A justice who does his best to interpret the Constitution or statute and apply the law of the land without prejudice could go far to restore faith in the highest court of the land.''  Neal Katyal, former personnel in the Obama administration, stated his support for Neil Gorsuch: ``I am confident Neil Gorsuch will live up to that promise'' to ``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''  The Washington Post editorial board, many others in Colorado's legal community, including the former cochair of the Host Committee of the Democratic National Convention in 2008, support the confirmation of Neil This is not a partisan judicial appointment; this is a judge who has strong bipartisan support from the people who know him best.  I hope we can live up to that high, noble intention of our Constitution, the purpose of the Senate, to make sure we are confirming somebody to do a lifetime service for this country in a way that respects our Constitution and the people of this country.  I hope that over the next several days as we debate the nomination, we will move away from this cliff of changing two centuries' worth of precedent in this body and instead come together in a way that befits the best nature of our country.

408,topic-id,556,"Mr.President, I wish to request that the U.Government officially recognize the last week in March as the Week on the Status of Black During the week of March 27, 2017, as part of Women's History Month and in honor of the United Nations Declaration designating 2015 as the Decade of Afro-Descendants, this week marks the perfect occasion on which to begin an annual recognition and celebration of Black women's contributions to American society.  Black women have long gone above and beyond the call of duty in their contributions to American society through civic engagement, high voter turnout, and serving as leaders in their communities. Even in the face of grave oppression throughout our Nation's history, Black women have continued to stand strong and contribute to the well-being of their families, communities, and our country as a whole. A recognition of the Week on the Status of Black Women by the Trump administration and Congress would send a clear message that the Federal Government recognizes the unique struggles and achievements of Black women in  Black women have consistently played a leading role in shaping our Nation's history, often behind the scenes and with little recognition. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery and bravely returned to the enslaved South over a dozen times to lead her people to freedom on the Underground A century later, Rosa Parks witnessed the oppression of her fellow Black women and took an active role in organizing the Montgomery Bus Boycott, while also taking up Black women's sexual harassment claims. Today, a Black woman, Carla Hayden, is our Nation's Librarian of Recognition of the Week on the Status of Black Women would honor the sacrifices of women such as Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, who paved the way for so many Black women in public service, business, and other industries today.  Yet even as Black women throughout our Nation's history have been leaders in American civic life, Black women today still continue to face many undue burdens. No one in America should have to choose between earning a paycheck and taking care of their family, but too many Black women who serve as primary family breadwinners are forced to make this painful choice. Black women continue to earn less than their male counteiparts and also less than women who are not Black women remain at the economic margins of society, and we all have a responsibility to help fix that.  This year, a coalition of organizations advocating for the well-being of women and communities of color will partner to elevate the stories, histories, and realities of Black women's lives. Each day of the week, starting on March 27 and continuing through March 31, will focus on a different challenge Black women face in society today, ranging from disproportionate experience with police violence to discriminatory media representation. Exploring these issues and acknowledging the centrality of Black women to our history and social fabric, along with recognizing the unique intersection of gendered and racialized inequities they face, is critical. As we continue to work to extend equal rights to all Americans, we must ensure that Black women are a leading part of this movement. I hope and request that this year will be a continuation of years past in celebration and intentional recognition of Black women in America through the Week on the Status of Black                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgS1993-2.txt,1866,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,March

1179,topic-id,542,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the title X Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval.  This resolution would permit discrimination against family planning healthcare providers that provide primary preventive and reproductive healthcare services to millions of women around the country. It will allow States to take away Federal funding from family planning clinics and make it much harder for millions of American women to meet with their healthcare providers and access basic care.  I am struggling to understand, amidst all these problems we are having to solve in this country and around the world, why this Congress seems to have such a singular fixation on controlling women's access to basic healthcare. This legislation is so far out of touch with the actual needs of our constituents. If we cut funding for women's health clinics, is that going to create more good-paying jobs? Is it going to open more factories in our upstate rural towns? I don't believe it will. It is certainly not going to make anyone healthier.  There are millions of American women, including thousands of women in my State of New York, who rely on title X health clinics for treatments, preventive care, and for family planning services. They need these health clinics because they provide contraception counseling, cancer screening, and medical expertise right there in their communities. Many of the women who use these services have nowhere else to go for access because title X clinics are often the only affordable option for them and may even be the only place within driving distance of their communities. Yet, once again, my colleagues are pushing legislation to limit women's options for accessing healthcare and making it harder for thousands of New York women to get the care and treatments they need. I continue to be amazed by how little empathy there seems to be for millions of women in our country who don't have the resources to travel to a major hospital outside of their communities and desperately need these local clinics to stay healthy.  Let's be very clear about who this legislation would hurt the most. This bill will hurt women in small towns and rural communities more than anyone else. It will cause lower income women to struggle even more. Every single one of my colleagues has many women in their States who rely on title X clinics and would suffer if these clinics had their Federal funding taken away.  So I urge my colleagues in this Chamber: When it is time to vote on this legislation, think about the women who live in your Think about the women who live in small towns and rural communities who are just trying to access basic women's healthcare services that they can afford. Think about the women who don't have big hospitals or big cities nearby. Think about the women who don't have enough money to travel. The bill is going to hurt them. It will make their lives harder, not easier.  We all have the responsibility to stand up for the women in our States, and that includes defending their access to healthcare and basic family planning services. I urge my colleagues to vote against this very discriminatory resolution.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

488,topic-id,383,"Mr.Speaker, I do thank my friend from Georgia (Mr.Woodall) for his able presentation on this very good bill and our colleague, Mr. I am sorry to change the subject back to something that is relevant, material, and germane. By the way, I am also looking forward to the investigation into Russia and the sale of such a huge percentage of our uranium by Hillary Clinton's State They approved it. But we will get into that later.  Right now we are talking about a fantastic bill because the EPA is very close to being omniscient, omnipotent, and ubiquitous--they are everywhere all the time. We have had a hard time in the last 20, 30 years as it got more and more heavenly in getting information on why they were making the decisions they were. As the EPA has continued to crush jobs, like in Texas if there were no EPA, we have agencies that have continued to make our water and air cleaner and cleaner every year, and, despite the EPA's constant interference, they are doing a great job.  But one of the things that we have wanted, as my friend, Mr.Woodall, was pointing out for years, is whether it is a Democrat in the White House or a Republican, we just wanted some openness. We wanted to know what these seemingly arbitrary rules were based upon. So the purpose of this rule coming from Chairman Smith is let's go ahead and require the EPA to do what anybody would have to do in one of our courtrooms, you got to show why there is a reason to take action.  But since the EPA has been at this level where they were basically unquestionable for so long and could make arbitrary and capricious decisions which could not be challenged effectively, this may be a very helpful start to stopping the EPA from being so heavenly they are not earthly good.  So I think it is a fantastic bill. It is something I hope will be a bipartisan vote as we require the EPA to just show the basis of what you are doing, and then we can know whether this American god, this EPA, actually has feet of clay or is back in the real world or is actually killing jobs unnecessarily.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2471-5.txt,1801,NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH,2017.0,28.0,March

621,topic-id,4527,"Mr.Speaker, it has been an interesting few weeks here in Washington, and we are not done with healthcare legislation. There has been a lot of talk about that, but, Mr.Speaker, I would like to say, I have been encouraged as today has worn on. We had a tough family meeting this morning together as Republicans, but, to me, what I felt was coming out of it in the end--disagreement on some important issues but agreement among Republicans that people are hurting under  People need relief from the high premiums, the high deductibles. So many people not only lost their doctor, lost their health insurance policy, but they can't afford--they tell us--to go to the doctors. We talked to constituents because they would have to get to several thousand dollars before the insurance portion would kick in.  People are hurting across the country, and, of course, we know that, without a single Republican vote, ObamaCare was passed, which cut Medicare by $716 billion dollars, with a ``B.'' And I know President Obama assured seniors: look, seniors, you know, you are not going to have to worry about this $716 billion in cuts to You won't be able to tell the difference. This is only going to affect the doctors, the healthcare providers.  What seniors have noticed who I have talked to around Texas and in other places in the country, they have noticed that when Medicare doesn't pay their doctor, doesn't pay for tests that are needed, and doesn't pay for medication that they specifically need then it does affect them personally.                              {time}  1915  The bill that we took up, that didn't get passed on Friday, that we didn't vote on, there was nothing that was going to help those on There is apparently some difference of opinion, but it appeared to many that some of us trusted that people between the ages of 50 to 64 were going to get hammered.  I am very encouraged to have seen Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, and our Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry incredibly busy today talking to Republican Members around the House about how we can get to a bill that will get 218--actually we need 216 right now--so that we can send it down the hall to the  Mr.Speaker, I am encouraged, and I hope others are, that we are not done. We had indications that the Senate was not going to take up the bill--even if we passed it on Friday, they were not going to take it up until sometime in So we have time to address this issue and come together on a bill that would pass.  Once again, a reference was made, Mr.Speaker--and it is so often that this event is referenced by Republicans when they get frustrated as to why we ended up with a bill that would require so many Republican arms to be twisted, that would endanger Republican seats to have to vote for it. People referenced back to this.  Remember some years back, some summers back--and I believe, actually, that was the last week of July of 2014, as I recall--in which Speaker Boehner had told us that he had cobbled together a bill that embraced 10 principles that every Republican in the House had agreed to. Some of them seemed a bit esoteric to me, but we agreed to them all. And we kept being told this is going to be a bill that embraces all the principles that all of us have agreed to.  So when the bill was finally filed on Tuesday evening, with Speaker Boehner having announced we were going to vote on it Thursday morning, for the first time, we got a look at the bill we were going to be voting on. By the time Thursday morning came rolling around, there had been so much information that came out--not opinion, but actually verbiage from the bill. It seems like it was around 60 pages, 70[[Page H2512]]pages, somewhere around there--but people were able to see for themselves what was there. There was so much commotion made about it that, by Thursday morning, much like Friday, Republicans made clear to our leadership--at that time Speaker Boehner--that they couldn't vote for it; that it didn't embody the 10 principles that we had all embraced.  I was so proud of my Republican Conference that Thursday because particularly a number of young Members, newer Members, got up in our emergency conference that they asked for. Speaker Boehner said: Well, I guess we just go on home and have the August recess.  Numerous Members said: No; let's have an emergency conference. Let's talk about this. We need to do something. We need to pass a good bill.  So people got up and they pointed out, like in a good family: Look, we have got differences, but we can reach agreement on this.  And there were probably 20 or so of us in a room for 2\1/2\ hours or so, and we compromised, and we got a bill that we could all vote on.  Unfortunately, at that time, there was a Democratic majority in the Senate, and we didn't get our bill passed through the Senate, but we showed that it could be done.  Once again, after Friday's problems, there are Members that are saying: Remember when we did that, where we just got people in a room and we agreed?  Mr.Speaker, I do believe, knowing so many of the Tuesday Group so well--they are good people--and the number one concern they have is their constituents and the things they are hearing from their constituents because they ran and they got elected to help people.  Everybody that I hear from on our side understands people have got to have help because ObamaCare is creating so many problems. I am hearing from many seniors, and it seems to be as a result of all of the $700-plus billion that Obama cut from  Whereas, 7 or 8 years ago, even 6 years ago, before ObamaCare really started being implemented, if they needed surgery, if they needed something, under Medicare, the doctors immediately took care of it. If it was medication, if it was a treatment, if it was surgery, whatever, they took care of it.  I am hearing more and more east Texans who are on Medicare tell me: Now, doctors are telling me they can't schedule it this week or next week like they used to because of ObamaCare; that the only way they can make ends meet and still stay in business, they need to schedule it a couple of months down the road.  Many of us on the Republican side were pointing out, when ObamaCare passed, that what this leads to is a form of rationed care. Whereas, right now, if you have good insurance and you like your doctor and you need something done, it gets done immediately. That is what made America's medical care so attractive to other countries around the world.  I have visited in Middle Eastern and north African countries where the wealthy would say: If I needed surgery done, I'd fly to the United Unfortunately, I have heard more than once that: Yeah, and the great thing was that I flew back and never had to pay for it.  Well, somebody paid for that, that is for sure.  It is important that we fix our healthcare system as best we can. I have an article from Conservative Review that came out today from Daniel I don't agree with everything in the article; but Daniel Horowitz, as usual, is quite thought-provoking.  He says: ``Earlier today, a couple of Republican officials, in a refreshing display of honesty, admitted what we have known all along: They don't want to repeal Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, admitted there won't be another attempt.  ``He's certainly come a long way from his 2014 campaign promise to repeal ObamaCare `root and branch' and his 2013 CPAC speech in which he said `anybody who thinks we've moved beyond it is dead wrong.'  ``As we explained yesterday, the compromise solution for repealing the core of ObamaCare, but not quite all of it, is already on the table, and Paul Ryan, Republican from Wisconsin, has already agreed to and campaigned on it. Why aren't they doing it? Because they don't want to repeal ObamaCare and never intended to.''  That is the part I do disagree with.  I know we have all said this, but it was in Speaker Boehner's pledge that he and his leadership colleagues cobbled together back in 2010 and it was in the Better Way that Speaker Ryan and his leadership colleagues cobbled together last fall that we have got to repeal We can't get down to this rationed care system where we are currently headed.  This says: ``As early as 2014, the Chamber of Commerce made it clear that their official position was to fix, not repeal Money talks, everything else from there walks.  ``The sentiment was evident today when Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas, the Senate majority whip, said that they will no longer pursue repeal of ObamaCare through budget reconciliation and that `it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis, and so we're happy to work on it with Democrats if we can find any who are willing to do so.'  ``There you have it, folks. They know darn well there are no Democrats who will ever have incentive to work with them to repeal They have always known that this had to be done unilaterally either through reconciliation or by blowing up the filibuster. But Republicans never intended to do so. That's why we heard all these phony excuses about process limitations. Now that they are proven false, Cornyn is at least being honest by saying they will repeal it when Democrats help them. When hell freezes over . . .''  And the article goes on.  Mr.Speaker, what Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn are talking about, I think they must have been discouraged when the House didn't pass a bill that would come their way. But good news for Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn, we are not done. People are hurting, and we are going to come together on a bill.  For those who attempted to say that those in the Freedom Caucus kept moving the goalposts, I know that was not said maliciously, but it was said. Anyone who said that was speaking just out of ignorance of what actually was the case.  Anybody that bothers to actually check and get the facts will find that, as many problems as people in the Freedom Caucus--and I am probably the newest member, I guess--had with this bill, we were doing what we could to reach a compromise that would give enough help, enough relief to Americans who are desperate for that help and that relief that we could hold our nose and vote for it.  There were all kinds of issues in that bill that create problems. For one thing, I would have thought a good amendment that would easily be accepted would be that, since this creates a new entitlement program, a tax credit program where you actually can get more money back--like a child tax credit, where we have so many people who are actually illegally in the country, claiming children, as there have been reports--and, of course, not everybody cheats on this. But there are numerous examples of stories around the country of people claiming to have children--mass numbers, dozens of them in the same house, and we don't know if they are in the country, we don't know if they are in another country, we don't know if they exist--and people getting more and more money back.  I had a senior citizen from Tyler telling me she is no longer working for H&R Block, that she used to during tax season. But it just grated on her so much that it created tension headaches and she couldn't sleep during tax season because she had so many people who did not have a Social Security number. But they got a tax number, and she would fill out the returns for them. Invariably, each would pull out a sheet of paper and would say: Don't I get this?  And it was the income tax credit--child earned credit.  She would fill it out, as they requested. And, invariably, they would get much more money back than they paid in. So it was a way of redistributing--it is not wealth, because the people that are in east Texas paying[[Page H2513]]those taxes, they are not wealthy. They are struggling to get by. That is why they can't afford the high deductibles that ObamaCare has driven them to.  Here it looks like we are going to have another program unless we get this amendment in there when we bring the bill back up.                              {time}  1930  So I am hoping that that will be one of the adjustments because we were seeking to have something in there to require you to be legally in this country before you could get more money back from your income tax than you paid in. It is a new form of welfare, just like some have found the tax credit to be, where they get more back than they paid in.  So that is a concern, creating a new entitlement as we are about to go over the $20 trillion mark in debt, that we are coming up with a new way to go even deeper and quicker into further debt. But there were a number of issues here with the bill.  The thing that I kept hearing--and I had telephone townhalls, Mr.Speaker, with, really, tens of thousands of people that we reached out to in east The technology is so great, I can ask questions and have them punch a number for yes, no, and get results on what people are thinking. It was feelings about ObamaCare and the need to do something about it and the help that is needed and the losses of insurance they had before ObamaCare, problems they have had since  East Texans, my constituents, need help. They want help. They want ObamaCare repealed, and they want a system back where they can choose their doctor, they have a relationship with their doctor, and they don't have an insurance company between them and their doctor or their hospital telling them what they can or can't have. And they don't want the government in between them and their healthcare provider telling them what they can or cannot have.  The health savings accounts that Republicans believe strongly could get us off this final road to complete rationed care, socialized medicine, like they have in England--it was a pleasure to talk to the sister of a member of Parliament from I have been in his home in England; he has been in my home in Tyler, Texas, just a great  But talking about our systems, and I pointed out, I have a wife, I have got three adult daughters, and so I am kind of sensitive to being pushed into a system like England has, no offense to those in But when we saw the numbers back during the ObamaCare debate that indicated a 19 percent higher survivability rate from the same point of breast cancer being discovered, well, that is one out of five are dying in England unnecessarily, or at least back there when we got those numbers. I am not sure what the numbers are now.  It may be that ObamaCare has created more problems and now we are moving, already, toward the percentages of recovery that England had that were not as good as ours. But I would just as soon not lose one out of five women who have breast cancer, which we were not losing in the U.and they were losing in  It was interesting. I didn't realize, and I learned yesterday that, actually, that is why, in England, yes, they have socialized medicine, but you can also pay for private care on top of the socialized medicine because it just takes forever to get the kind of treatment that you need when you need it. So people with any means in England, they have the socialized medicine that is so inefficient, that tax funds pay for so inefficiently, and you get as much government as you do health care. But, if you have money, then, on top of the massive taxes you pay, you can also, then, pay for your own health care on top of that. That is different from  But, look, the bottom line is we don't need to continue down this route. So, again, I am encouraged we are going to come together and we are going to work toward a remedy.  It disturbed me that we heard from people who sounded like they knew what they were talking about, that rates are going to go up for a couple of years, and we are hoping that maybe 3 years after the Republicans would lose the majority in the next election because people are so upset about their higher premiums that then it might come down, premiums might come down 10 percent.  But the concern to me is not about losing the majority. It is about losing Americans unnecessarily if we don't fix this disastrous ObamaCare that is costing seniors. It is costing 50- to 64-year-olds. It is costing young people money that they shouldn't have to spend in the way that they are being required.  So some say we were moving the goalposts as the House Freedom Caucus, but, actually, from the beginning, we did indicate we would like to remove what experts are telling us in title I would dramatically bring down the cost of premiums very quickly--very quickly.  But we had agreed. Heck, we agreed with the Democrats, before they pushed through ObamaCare, let's work on a law together, bipartisan, that will make sure that insurance companies can't play games over preexisting conditions because it has resulted in unfairness and, at times, I can say as a former judge, actually, fraud. Let's work on that one.  Then I think there was fairly universal agreement on both sides of the aisle here that, if you are 26, you are still living with your parents, then you ought to be able to be on their health insurance. From my standpoint, I didn't even care. I didn't think we actually even needed an age, a cutoff age.  If you are 50 and you are still living with your parents, which we hope will soon be remedied by an economy turning around with a new President who knows how to get things going, but if you are still at home when you are 50, I don't have a problem. If you are still living with your parents, then you ought to be able to have a family insurance policy and be on it. So those were not problems.  I had a doctor friend back in east Texas who said I was a purist. I like him. He is a great guy. He apparently was a great surgeon. But I realized that, in his letter, he was speaking from a great deal of ignorance as he continued to point out things that simply weren't true, unless a purist is someone who says: I will vote for the bill, but you have got to give us something in the way of amendments to this bill that will help my constituents bring down the price.  Now, see, to me, that is not a purist because we were all willing to compromise in the Freedom Actually, in communicating with President Trump two different times, we thought we had an agreement. Then we would hear back from our leadership: You can't do that. Either there is a problem with the Parliamentarian and it puts the whole bill at risk, or, gee, you are going to lose votes from some other group.  But I still believe, as I did then, if we would get the intermediaries out of the way, that Republicans can come together, Tuesday, more moderate group, Freedom We can get people together like we did 3 years ago in We can get together and work out a compromise.  Now, to me, someone who agrees twice to a compromise that really bothers them is not the purist that I would expect, but then again, I guess it depends on your own personhood as to what you think is pure and what you think is not.  So, anyway, I appreciate very much, Mr.Speaker, the former Speaker, Newt Gingrich, pointing out yesterday that it is a good thing that this bill did not pass on Friday because we know, as Speaker Gingrich pointed out, in 1994, Democrats lost the majority in this room because they tried to push through We know that in 2010, Democrats lost the majority in this room because they had pushed through ObamaCare against the majority will of the American people.  As former Speaker Gingrich pointed out, if we had rammed through this bill and, for example, people didn't see premiums come down before the next election, we would justifiably lose the majority in this House, and there are some good people that are serving here that should not be defeated. They are doing the best they can.  But we can do better than where the bill stood on Friday, and I am very grateful to Speaker Ryan, to leader McCarthy, our whip, for working so hard today, reaching out, seeing them all over the place trying to work, talking with different ones of us. It is really encouraging, and I would hope, in[[Page H2514]]the future, that we will start those things, we will--yes, we appreciate all the listening sessions, but then, as happened too often under Speaker Boehner, somebody, we don't even know who--there were a couple of things that made me wonder: Who wrote this? Is this the insurance lobby? Where did this come from?  But bring the bill out and let us see it instead of telling every Republican: It is going to go through committee; and Democrats are going to have a million amendments and we have got to vote down every one of them; we don't want any Republican amendments; we are going to take it like it is.  Well, see, to some of us, that is not really regular order. Regular order is a chance to have amendments, and especially from people in the majority who see real problems with the bill.  So we can do that, and I look forward to doing that. And since we knew the Senate wasn't going to take it up until May sometime anyway, we have got time to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I hope you felt the same as I did hearing all across our Conference, people saying, look, this is important enough. We are going to have time where we go back to our districts between now and the middle of May when the Senate might take this bill up.  Let's make sure we don't go on recess, go back to our districts to have people scream at us because we hadn't passed something. Let's stay here, and let's get it done like we did 3 years ago on the border security bill.  But we have got a lot of work to do. There are serious problems with the bill. But we also now know, despite what some have represented, that, gee, we can't know what the Parliamentarians would say or recommend. It is great to know that the Parliamentarian in the Senate, actually, Assistant Parliamentarians work a great deal like our splendid Parliamentarian here.  If you are getting ready to file a bill or if you are thinking about an amendment, you can actually go to any one of our Parliamentarian or assistants, show them the language. They can't give an obligatory ruling, and they generally tell us when they advise us: This is what I think, how the rule would apply there, and you may want to tweak this or that.  They always have the caveat: But remember, I am the I don't rule on anything. All I would do, if I am allowed, or it is requested, I will whisper in the ear of the presiding--which, in the Senate, hopefully, would be Vice President  And, gee, the Byrd Rule is not that complicated. When you are under reconciliation, it needs to be about the budget. So, if anything that is amended or added to or part of the bill will materially affect the budget, it survives the Byrd Rule and it stays in. That is it.  The word in the Byrd Rule is ``incidental.'' It can't be just incidental or have an incidental effect on the budget. It has got to have a material effect; otherwise, it is considered extraneous.  Well, I would hope, knowing my friend, a former Member of the House here, former Conference chair, now Vice President, I would hope and certainly imagine if our friend, the Vice President, is in the presiding officer's chair in the Senate and a Democratic Senator stands up and says, ``I make a point of order because I believe this violates the Byrd Rule, where the House inserted a provision, you have to show that you are you lawfully in the U.in order to get the tax credit,'' well, there may be people that are so used to massive numbers here in Washington that they would say, well, those millions or tens or hundreds of millions, that may not be material, that may be only incidental.                              {time}  1945  I hope my friend, my Vice President, would understand that, to Americans, the kind of money we would be talking about is hard-earned and it is material to the budget. So what happens if the Vice President then rules--who is the President of the Senate--well, your point of order is overruled, it is not appropriate, it doesn't violate the Byrd rule. Well, then that same Democrat or another could jump up and say: I appeal the ruling of the char.  Then what happens?  Normally, a Republican would stand and move to table the appeal of the ruling of the And then there are far more than enough Republicans to vote to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair, which means the ruling stands, nothing is fatal, and we get closer to a repeal of Even more important than that, we get closer to giving our constituents the help they really need.  So it has been a long few weeks. It was a very long conference, but I am encouraged, Mr.I hope that Americans end up encouraged. I am glad the bill didn't pass on Friday just as I was 3 years ago when the original de facto amnesty bill that Speaker Boehner tried to shove through. I think we can get to a good bill. I am looking forward to seeing that happen and working with my friends here to get it done.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2510.txt,1801,PROTOCOL TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY OF 1949 ON THE ACCESSION OF,2017.0,28.0,March

1078,topic-id,4043,"Mr.Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to follow my good friend from Iowa, Steve I know Mr.King cares deeply about He not only cares deeply, but having been in the private sector in business where he, like our President, was involved in building things and making things work and making things accessible, he has good solutions. I have no doubt if he were not in Congress, he probably would have gotten the bid on the sections of the wall that the President is taking bids on even now.  We are at an interesting time. It has been interesting to see some of the messages. Some are hurtful. I know the liberal papers like the Longview newspaper immediately pick up on any dissension in the Republican Party, especially if it is aimed at conservatives like me. I don't know why we use the term ``conservative.'' It used to be just somebody with common sense that believed in keeping our word, believed in following the  We seem to get in trouble when we don't follow the For example, it makes very clear that everyone who is an American citizen is supposed to have rights. We can't assure the rights of every person in every other country. That would turn into this remarkable experiment in a republican form of government that we have here.  It is really a democratic Republic--a Republic where you select representatives so that you don't have big gangs running around as a majority wreaking havoc when people disagree with them. We elect representatives so they can come together and, hopefully, read bills and not have to vote on them so they can find out what is in them, go ahead and read the bills in advance and hopefully have something to do with the writing of the bills, especially things that affect people's health.  When we see messages like have come out today, it is unpleasant. One was apparently sent out from the White House, condemning the Freedom Caucus, apparently, because we have the audacity to want Republicans, including those at the White House, to keep our promise. I still remain in favor of--as do my friends on the Freedom Caucus and a lot of others--and remain committed to our promise to repeal  I realize there can be honest disagreement. Some think if we give more power to Health and Human Services, more Federal Government, and give more power to the people we trust in the Federal Government, whom I do trust, then they can do what Congress is not willing to do, and that is repeal ObamaCare and have a system in place that will assure people can get health care that is affordable.  The fact is most people talk about how we have got to make sure people can get health insurance. And then, over the years, they use the term ``health care'' synonymously with ``health insurance.'' Actually, the fact is we should be most concerned about people, all Americans, having access to affordable health care, whether they have insurance or not.  One of the problems that health insurance has gotten into over the last 50 years is that health insurance has ceased to be insurance. Under ObamaCare, health insurance was certainly not insurance.  If you look up the root of insurance, the word ``insure,'' insurance was intended to be something you could purchase very cheaply that would insure against an unforeseeable event some point in the future, maybe a catastrophic accident, a chronic disease, something that you don't expect and you hope never happens. For the insurance companies, it is actually a form of legalized wager that you are paying a little amount, hoping that never happens, but just in case it does, insurance will be able to take care of it at that point.  We have long since lost the idea of true insurance, and people began paying health insurance companies not to insure against an unforeseeable event in the future, but to pay them to manage their health care, to tell their doctors what medication they could prescribe, what procedures they would cover to help their patients, telling the patients which doctors they could see.  Actually, the truth is, as the Federal Government got more and more involved, we saw less and less insurance and more and more insurance companies managing people's health care, and the managing insurance companies were actually following the lead of the Federal  The more we passed laws regarding health care and insurance, the more the Federal Government had a say in people's health care and well-being and the more insurance companies moved into a management role, much as the Federal Government in Medicare and Medicaid moved into a governing role.  This morning, I am meeting with constituents that are very caring individuals and who provide health centers that are extremely affordable, very, very cheap, but provide quality care for people that can't afford the care. They don't have to go to the emergency room, which costs more than going to a clinic for minor matters. It saves a lot of money. It is a lot of cheaper.  Of course, emergency room care is about the most expensive care you can get, and people who don't have insurance often go and line up at emergency rooms, which drives up the cost of everybody's health care and everybody's health insurance. We can break the cycle of that.  I understand there are very well-meaning friends on the Republican side of the aisle that think if we just give the Federal Government, give Health and Human Services, more power to control all of this, we have a guy in place that I do believe can do great things to cure the ills of health care.  My problem is, if we don't repeal the outrage known as ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act--which is really unaffordable--if we don't actually repeal it here in the House, have the Senate repeal it, then no matter how much those in the executive branch and those in Health and Human Services, including my friend, the Secretary, no matter how much they do to help Americans, the next liberal that comes in, the next Kathleen Sebelius who comes in thinking she knows more about what is best for you than you do, then all of those great reforms will go out the window. Because the Secretary will have more authority and more ability to make regulation under the Republican proposed bill, then I am quite certain that somebody that comes in, like Kathleen Sebelius, who knows better what you need than you do, will make sure that the regulations and the overreach become even more burdensome.  I totally understand the President's frustration. He was told that the Republican bill would basically repeal The truth is I totally agree with the We need to act to repeal I stand with the President, through whatever hardship, to repeal  I have heard people referring already to the Republican bill as There are some good things in the bill,[[Page H2586]]but it appears to analysts that I trust and have a reputation for being accurate that premiums will go up and that this bill is not going to really bring down health insurance costs and that they may go up for the next 2 years.  Hopefully, in 2019, after Republicans have lost the majority because we didn't keep our promise, they are projecting that in 2019 the prices will go down maybe 10 percent if everything works out well. That would be good for the new Democratic majority because they will have taken office and they will get all the credit for costs coming down.  Even though it is very slightly, they will get the credit, and Republicans will be left out to dry, which means the American Dream--freedom, entrepreneurship, the ability to decide what health care you need, when, without government or an insurance company telling you otherwise--that dream of personal independence will be gone, and you will see a new America that begins to reflect the values of the former Soviet Union, which anybody that studies history like I majored in and never quit studying, you know there has never, ever been a time when socialism succeeded. It always has failed. It always will fail.  Even the Apostle Paul's effort to bring into the common storehouse and share and share alike, eventually he realized his error and that it is going to work in Heaven, but it is not going to work here. So, new rule: If you don't work, you don't eat.  The Pilgrims, just a beautiful Compact: Bring into the common storehouse, share and share alike. But after so many died that first winter, they realized: Maybe it will work out better if we let people have private property and they get to keep, use however they want, whatever they produce. What a great idea.  That kind of entrepreneurship, that kind of encouragement and incentive in this world for people to do well, to control their own destiny, is what made America the greatest country in the history of the world.  Now, as we proceeded over the years, we have moved toward more and more socialism, especially in the last 50 years. We have now allowed people like Bill Ayers to take over our educational facilities. They have been successful.  I understand 30, 40 percent of young people coming out of college today think that socialism would be a good thing. Well, it would be in a perfect world, where everybody worked as hard as they could and then shared and shared alike, but we have seen in this world that will never work. The only way socialism remains as long as it does, as it did in the Soviet Union, is if you have a ruthless totalitarian government that takes people's freedom away. But even then, it is all going to be for nothing.  We have an article from Mark Miller in Reuters, and the title is: ``Republican Health Reform Is the Real Disaster for Older Americans.''  One of the things I have got to say, Mr.Speaker, I was hoping in our bill--since we know and we have talked about all these years since ObamaCare passed that it cuts $716 billion from Medicare, and seniors need help. They are beginning to experience rationed health care the way the VA has been administering to our veterans for too long.  Hopefully, we will get that fixed. I don't know the person that President Trump appointed to head up the She has been part of the VA system, so I am concerned she may not be able to deliver on reenergizing the VA to actually help veterans.  With all the problems that have existed across the Veterans Administration, which are a clear example of what happens when a federal government takes complete charge of a medical system, and with all the veterans we have in record numbers committing suicide because they just feel so hopeless--they feel like there is nowhere to turn. The VA doesn't help them. They have got nowhere to turn, and they do take that irreversible step of hopelessness. People that are seeing that in the VA now are coming and saying they want the Federal Government to have more control over people's health care, kind of like the VA, because that is such a good thing.                              {time}  1215  Do we need more people killing themselves in the general society at the levels of our precious veterans?  I mean, let's take care of our veterans. Let's drop that to zero for veterans and let's work on it for the general population.  I do believe that the bill that my friend Tim Murphy helped push through, did such a great job on--it was bipartisan; we had people on both sides of the aisle working fervently on that bill--I think will be able to do some good. For 30 years or so the pendulum swung too far against people getting the mental health care they needed. So it is good to see that change.  But, Mr.Speaker, this bill--I left at the end of the week last week, and I know a lot of people were down, and I was in part, but the other side was. I really felt like this was going to be a good week, we were going to come together, we were going to discuss, we were going to find a way to come together. I thought on Tuesday--Monday evening, as I saw our leadership getting together with members of our party, I thought: Yeah, I bet we can get something by the end of the week. I got the feeling most of the Republicans felt if we don't have a bill that we can agree on and get passed for the good of the American people, let's actually take steps.  Okay, our leadership said we can't repeal Well, let's repeal at least as much as we can. Let's at least repeal as much as we did 2 years ago. Let's at least not give more power to Health and Human Let's at least take out some of the requirements from ObamaCare that have caused premiums to skyrocket. We are told: Well, trust HHS because they will be able to help bring down premiums so we don't have to take that action in this body ourselves.  For all of those who were ignorant and didn't understand, the Freedom Caucus was trying to reach an agreement so that we could vote a bill out of this House, but those of us in the Freedom Caucus all had heard over and over from constituents: You have got to do something to bring down the cost of our health insurance, of our health care. Our deductible is too high, we will never be able to get to our insurance help. Our premiums are so high.  I heard from businesspeople that their costs have tripled in the last few years. They cannot afford to stay in business and keep paying these high premiums for their employees. They will have to leave them high and dry, which means they go to And I am really shocked that even people in the Obama administration would brag about adding millions of people to Medicaid, which has not been the help that people needed. We were told: Oh, no, ObamaCare will drive them to great insurance.  No; it has driven millions to Medicaid that is even worse than  So I know most of the Republicans on this side of the aisle believe that so many States have good solutions. So what is our solution to help the States?  Gee, if we give more power to the Federal Government, then they could start a high-risk pool that will be able to pull people out of the insurance policies where premiums are spiking, and then the Federal Government will run that for a while and then devolve it back to the  I am sorry, Mr.Speaker, in my time in Congress and even my time on the bench as a judge and chief justice, I have watched government, and I just don't trust government. That was something I shared with our That was something Justice Scalia told to a group from my home in There were probably 50 or 60 seniors who came up.  I asked: Is there something special you would like to see or do while you are here?  They said: Well, you seem to be friends with Justice Do you think we could meet him?  Well, I will ask. Well, son of a gun, Justice Scalia found the time, and we met him over at the Supreme  He said: Well, what questions do you have?  He didn't start with a speech.  He said: Well, okay, Louie said you wanted to meet me. Here I am. What questions have you got?  He leaned back against the table at the front of the room, and nobody said anything.  He said: Oh, come on, I have taken time. I want to come here and let you meet me.[[Page H2587]]  I loved how abrupt he was and straight to the point.  He said: Come on, here I am, have the courage, ask your question.  One of our seniors said: Well, Justice Scalia, would you say that the United States is the most free country in the history of the world because of our Bill of Rights, that it is the best ever?  Justice Scalia surprised me, but then I thought, well, yeah, he is exactly right.  He said: Oh, gosh, no. The Soviets had a better bill of rights than we have. It had a lot more rights in there. No, no, no. The reason we are the most free country in the history of the world is because the Founders did not trust government. So they gave us a Constitution that tried to put as many obstacles as it possibly could between people in Washington--at the time, first New York, Philadelphia, then But people at the Federal level creating laws or regulations, they wanted it as hard as possible. That is why the President is not a Prime Minister selected by the It is why we have three branches instead of one or two. They wanted to make it hard to pass laws.  He went into further deliberation on that. It was very informative. He was exactly right. I studied the Soviet I remember in college when I was at Texas A&M I did a paper--and I got an A on it--about the Soviet Constitution, the Soviet rights. They did have more rights spelled out. But the trouble is, their founders wanted government to do things, and trusted government implicitly so that it was totalitarian, so the bill of rights they wrote meant nothing, the Constitution meant nothing.  That is where we are headed here, it is with bureaucrats having taken charge over people's lives, their health care, their financial situations, usurping or at least getting copies of people's finance records. You used to have to get a warrant to do that.  Now the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just gets them when they want to. That should be illegal. It should be unconstitutional. It should require a warrant with probable cause established under oath that a crime has been committed and this person probably committed it. I used to sign warrants if probable cause was established. Not anymore.  Under Obama, the Democratic Congress passed a law saying: Yeah, let them do whatever they want to somehow help us with our financial situation.  Well, when you combine what they have done with what the NSA, CIA, and Justice Department have done to invade people's rights, we are severely limited in the privacy we once had.  I know there were people who were shocked that Congress passed a bill regarding internet privacy rights, but the fact is that our party should have done a better job of getting the message out of what it really did. It just repealed the intrusion that the Obama administration had with regulation and got us back to where we were a few years ago. So there are still protections; it is just not the intrusiveness of the Federal Government that President Obama created.  Some of us were convinced that he was not as concerned with privacy rights as we were or as others in America were, and he was not as concerned about the United States' control of the internet as we were because he gives away the ability to do websites to an international group instead of trusting the United That is different. President Obama didn't trust the United States to be fair to the world. Those of us in Congress, at least on our side of the aisle, thought we would do a better job. I still think we will do a better job.  What has been heartbreaking the last day and a half is to see it doesn't appear that Republican leaders are trying to work with conservatives to get to a solution. We have now seen the solution is: go to war with those who want to stand on the Constitution; contact everybody who donates to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the National Republican Party, contact the big donors who donate to candidates; and make sure they send messages to all the Republicans that they better get on board and vote for a bill that those people who are calling never read, like some of us have, and that they didn't research. They are just trusting the people they have been donating to to do the right thing.  If that were the case, Republicans would have repealed ObamaCare a long time ago, and it would have been the first thing we took up in January, and we would never have had ObamaCare because Republicans would have stopped it when we did have the chance. We had multiple chances. But that is another story for another day.  So I am sorry, this bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority. But that is not my number one concern. Yes, it bothers me that I think this bill could lead to our loss of majority in 2018; and, yes, it concerns me that, from what I am hearing from friends across the aisle, the first thing they want to do if they get the majority in 2018 is impeach and remove from office Donald  So it has really been amazing to see the war develop the last day and a half, that those in October who stood with the President when our leaders were saying: Forget Our numbers are clear, he has no chance of winning. So our best hope is for every Republican Member to save yourself. Win your election so that when Hillary Clinton is President next January, we can, in the House, rein her in.  But I am so grateful the rank and file of our party stood fast and said: No, if Trump doesn't win, we are not going to rein in president Hillary She will do whatever she wants.  Heck, we couldn't even get our party to impeach Koskinen when the guy clearly lied to us here. Other members of the Cabinet in the Obama administration clearly lied, and we couldn't get our group together to remove perjuring people from the Cabinet?  At least now, hopefully, we are going to get the documentation that shows the kind of crimes that were being committed in the last administration.  But in the meantime, people are hurting. They need their premiums to come down. I know we can trust Health and Human Services in this administration to try to bring down costs. But the words of my late friend Justice Scalia: If you guys in Congress, with the power to repeal a bad bill, don't have the guts to do it, don't come running across the street to us and ask us to repeal your bad bill. Heck, just go to the floor, repeal the bad law, and leave us alone.  That is all I am asking, Mr.The courts have not worked out extremely well for people who love the Constitution in recent years, and I know the President is frustrated. He is probably nearly as frustrated as I am almost maybe. I am told that maybe some of these anti-Freedom Caucus tweets originated with his Chief of Staff  But I want to suggest, as Sam Rayburn did when he was Speaker: My friends, Mr.Speaker, the Republican brothers and sisters are not your enemy. They are your friends. They want to repeal ObamaCare, bring down costs, get more control back to people. If we pass a bill that doesn't bring down premiums and give the American people hope and not give more power to the government and hope they do a better job in this administration, then we will deserve to be voted out.  I just hope, Mr.Speaker, we will do what we promised to do. I hope those who are getting calls and emails demanding they call their representatives, if they have been big donors, tell their Congressmen to get on board with the bill. I hope they will trust us who are reading the bills on their behalf.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgH2585-2.txt,1801,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,30.0,March

Montenegro is trying to do everything that Putin hates--where you can actually vote for your own leaders, where you can have a judicial system that works, where people can walk the streets without fear, and where the leadership doesn't steal the country blind.  I want to let the people of Russia know--for those who went into the streets yesterday or the day before to protest the corruption of the Putin regime--that you have my undying respect and admiration, because I can only imagine how hard that was.  For the people of Montenegro, I know they have been waiting a long time for this day to come because Russia and, generally, Putin have been trying to overthrow their government.  To those people in this body who proclaim they are for freedom and liberty, here is what I suggest. If you are not for other people's freedom and other people's liberty, you will eventually lose yours. The idea that we can be safe and free and not engage the world and sit on the sidelines and watch people like Putin turn the world order upside down and not be affected is at best naive. It is worse than naive, but I want to be nice and say it is just naive.  What Putin is doing throughout the world is trying to break the backs of the world order, NATO, and the European He is trying to drive a wedge between the NATO countries, and he will be the biggest beneficiary of that.

But our work is not done because it is one thing to vote in favor of Montenegro's entering NATO over Russia's objections. That is not enough. Senator McCain and myself, Senators Cardin and Rubio--Democrats and Republicans--all have crafted legislation to punish Russia for interfering in our elections. And they did. They are trying to break the backs of democracy in Ukraine, Georgia, and the Baltic nations. I hope the next thing we do in this body, in short order, on Russia is to punish them for their efforts to interfere and change and destabilize American democracy. I don't think they changed the outcome, but it was the Russians who did this to the Democratic Party, and I think every Republican should be equally offended.

986,topic-id,523,"Mr.President, in 2006, I was successful in enacting much needed updates to the IRS whistleblower program. Up until that time, the program was entirely a voluntary award program. There was also no central office within the IRS for handling whistleblower claims. Given this, there was little incentive for whistleblowers to step forward potentially risking their careers.  My 2006 amendments sought to bolster the IRS whistleblower program by making a special program targeted at going after high-dollar tax cheats, such as corporations. It did this by making awards mandatory in cases where a whistleblower discloses tax fraud totaling $2 million or more. Moreover, the 2006 amendments established the Whistleblower Office within the IRS to formalize and manage the program.  The IRS whistleblower program has turned into one of the most effective programs in addressing tax evasion--leading to the recovery of more than $3 billion in taxes that otherwise would have been lost to fraud. I firmly believe the program has the potential to collect even greater sums going forward. However, for this to occur, the IRS is going to have to completely embrace the program and start to view whistleblowers as their allies.  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a report on the program in 2015 that expressed concerns that long timelines and poor communication may be discouraging whistleblowers. This is exactly what I have been hearing from whistleblowers for years. Too often whistleblowers are waiting in the dark for years with no communication on where their claim is in the system.  While the IRS has made improvements in this area, I fear that without further improvements some whistleblowers may start to question whether stepping forward is worth their time and effort. My concern is exacerbated by the fact that under current law, IRS whistleblowers have no protections against employer retaliation for good-faith disclosures.  That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senator Wyden today in introducing legislation that seeks to address these issues. The IRS Whistleblower Improvements Act would increase communication between the IRS and whistleblowers, while protecting taxpayer privacy, and provide legal protections to whistleblowers from employers retaliating against them for disclosing tax abuses.  To increase communication, our bill would specifically allow the IRS to exchange information with whistleblowers where doing so would be helpful to an investigation. It would further require the IRS to provide status updates to whistleblowers at significant points in the review process and allows for further updates at the discretion of the It does this while ensuring the confidentiality of this information is maintained.  Moreover, to protect whistleblowers from employer retaliation, our bill extends antiretaliation provisions to IRS whistleblowers that are presently afforded to whistleblowers under other whistleblower laws, such as the False Claims Act and Sarbanes- Too often, whistleblowers are treated like skunks at a picnic. This is unfortunate, as often the only way to discover fraud and abuse is for a whistleblower to step forward. It is time we roll out the welcome mat for IRS whistleblowers. Our bill takes a good step in that direction.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Wyden and me in supporting this commonsense legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgS2100.txt,457,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,29.0,March

It will be in the next budget session they have to deal with moving forward, if we don't address this situation.  So people keep talking about a rush process. Over a year ago, we put together a Medicaid task force, met with groups of people, met with Governors, we took a lot of information, and put together a plan that addresses the needs of Medicaid is growing.

755,topic-id,944,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday in the Subcommittee on Immigration, the chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin, attempted to reprimand me by reminding me that House rules prevent Members from ``casting aspersions on the President of the United States.'' And what did I say to get this reprimand? I said that the President of the United States had said that Mexicans were criminals and rapists.  Well, as the sportscasters used to say, let's go to the videotape. Almost the first words out of Donald Trump's mouth when he descended the golden escalators to launch his Presidential campaign were this:       When Mexico sends its people, they are not sending their      best. They are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They      are rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.  Well, I left out that part about some, I assume, are good people.  But the chairman of the committee said I was not following House rules because I was casting aspersions on the President because, apparently, I was saying what the President, himself, had actually said. And if that was offensive to the chairman, I agree. It is offensive. That was the point of making the speech.  So is repeating the words of the President against House rules? And if so, why? Because they are hateful and ugly things to say about our fellow human beings?  I don't think we should be barred from repeating the words of the President because they are hateful and ugly things to say about our fellow human beings, because he said them, and he is the President, and I respect the office.  So maybe it has to be something else. Maybe we cannot say things the President has said because it is not appropriate to say some of the things he has said about people, like the dehumanizing language he uses when describing which body parts he can grab women by, for example.  Now, Mr.Speaker, rather than saying, as I said earlier, let's go to the videotape, I think every single American has seen that videotape. When I have discussed the President saying these awful, hurtful things about where he can grab women, either here on the floor or on the Judiciary Committee, I[[Page H2520]]have actually had to clean up the language so it is safe for daytime C-SPAN audiences.  So what is it about repeating the words of this particular President in the U.House of Representatives that the gentleman from Wisconsin feels is a violation of the rule?  Maybe it is the lies. I looked through the House rules, and I didn't see any section that said, Members, thou shalt not lie. No, Mr.Speaker, that wasn't in the House rules. But, clearly, repeating things that this President said means that you will be repeating lies, and it just goes with the territory.  There was the original lie as President, barely a few hours in office, saying that his crowd was the largest crowd in the history of Presidential inaugurations.  Then there was the one about the Muslim ban, which the President said was a Muslim ban; his key adviser, the former mayor of New York, said was a Muslim ban; his other key adviser, Stephen Miller, said was a Muslim ban; but which the White House tried to say was not, in fact, a Muslim ban because it didn't ban all  Several Federal courts have agreed with the President that what he ordered was a Muslim ban and disagreed with the President's lawyer saying that it was not a Muslim ban.  But what about when the President said that he saw American Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11? We know that was a lie. Or that 3 million illegal votes were cast on election day, causing the President to lose the popular vote, which he had walked back from the claim originally that 3 million undocumented immigrants had voted on election day? In either case, it was a lie.  Then there is the illegal wiretapping ordered by the previous President of the United States, President Obama, on President-elect Trump, which certainly looks like a lie at this point.  So, Mr.Speaker, I am starting to wonder if repeating a lie that the President has told the American people is against the House rules. Or maybe it is accusing the President of lying that is, in the words of the subcommittee chairman, casting aspersions.  But let's take a look. Here is the definition of the verb ``lie'' from Webster's Dictionary: ``to make an untrue statement with the intent to deceive; to create a false or misleading impression.''  By those definitions, I would say I am on pretty solid ground, from a factual standpoint, that the President of the United States has told lies.  Water is wet, dogs have four legs, and President Trump tells lies. There may be exceptions, but basically all three are truthful statements.  Unless we are outlawing the truth in Congress, I think that pointing out lies by our President is not only within the rules, it is our moral obligation and duty as elected leaders of a free nation to point them out.  So then I am left to wonder, ``What is it about repeating the President's words that so upset the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin?'' and I figured it out. It is upsetting to Republican Members of the House to hear the words of the President of the United States because they know they have to defend them as the leader of their party, and I can understand why that would make any human being very uncomfortable.

1180,topic-id,964,"Mr.President, I rise today in opposition to the Congressional Review Act measure, which would allow discrimination against title X family planning providers, which in turn could roll back access to family planning and preventive health services for women and their families in New Hampshire and across our country.  Throughout my time in public service, I have always fought to ensure[[Page S2130]]that women have meaningful access to the healthcare they need. I have fought to ensure that they can make their own healthcare decisions, and, in doing so, control their own destinies.  To compete economically on a level playing field, women must be able to make their own decisions about if--or when--to start a family. They should not have to pay more than men do for healthcare. They should be able to visit providers of their own choice who understand their healthcare needs. To fully participate not only in our economy but also in our democracy, women must be recognized for their capacity to make their own healthcare decisions, just as men are. They also must have full independence to make their own health decisions, just as men do.  During my time as Governor of New Hampshire, I restored family planning funds and pushed to restore State funding for Planned Parenthood, and I am going to continue fighting to ensure that women have the care they need, while standing firm against efforts here in Congress to roll back the progress that has been made.  Unfortunately, the vote we are taking today is a continuation of a partisan agenda that has been focused on restricting the care that women and their families can receive. The fact that Vice President Mike Pence was called in to cast the deciding vote to advance this measure shows just how far Republican leadership will go in order to undermine women's access to critical healthcare.  For more than 40 years, title X has provided women and their families with comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. When the legislation was originally passed in 1970, it was part of a bipartisan effort, with the support of prominent In the years that have followed, title X has been essential in delivering important services to some of our Nation's most underserved communities. That is why, in New Hampshire, title X and Planned Parenthood still have broad support in our communities, even if they have been the subject of political gamesmanship here in  Title X has support from Granite Staters because they have seen the real difference it has made in their lives and in the lives of their neighbors. They know that in some parts of the State there are no other options or, if other options do exist, they don't provide women with the same expertise and commitment to reproductive health that title X providers do.  For those in rural communities, for low-income women and men, and for members of the LGBTQ community, title X supported health centers have been a major source of preventive care and reproductive health services, including cancer screenings, birth control, HIV and STI tests, and counseling services. And title X's important public health services translate into savings for taxpayers. In 2010, title X investments resulted in net savings for Federal and State governments of $7 billion.  The measure we are voting on today would undermine this progress and the safety net for countless citizens. This measure would allow States to discriminate against providers and take away investments in family planning clinics, ultimately taking away these key services for those who need them most.  Last year, more than 4 million women and men at over 4,000 health centers across our Nation received care through title This includes around 20,000 patients in New Hampshire, including roughly 11,000 patients receiving care through title X supported Planned Parenthood centers. Those services can't just be replaced by other providers, even community health centers that do great work. But two counties in New Hampshire don't have a community health center at all. Others don't have the capacity to replace this work or this specialized experience that can make a critical difference to a woman's health.  In New Hampshire and other States, Planned Parenthood and the community health centers are often partners, working in tandem to get patients the reproductive healthcare they need. But when I hear from community health centers around New Hampshire, they tell me they would not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is defunded.  Make no mistake about it, this CRA, which would let States discriminate against providers in the title X program, combined with the consistent attempts to defund Planned Parenthood by some in Congress, would be a disaster for women in New Hampshire and all across the That is why a number of leading advocates have come out against these efforts to overturn title X regulations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, the Human Rights Campaign, and dozens more. I share their concerns and oppose the measure we will consider today, and I am going to continue to fight against these attempts to roll back access to reproductive health and preventive services.  It is critical that we have a healthcare system that ensures that all women and their families can get the care they need. What we cannot do is eliminate services and discriminate against providers who have been providing critical, cost-effective healthcare to millions of Americans for decades. I strongly oppose this effort to undermine the title X program, and I will vote against this measure today.

Well, after 13 hours at the Rules Committee on Wednesday,[[Page H2380]]did we report to the floor the Republicans' replacement to the Affordable Care Act?  And why not? Because the legislation was not extreme enough. It didn't hurt enough people. It didn't make enough people uninsured. It didn't give a large enough tax break to the wealthiest among us.  That 13-hour exercise yielded nothing except to reveal the callous depths of the Republican Party's attempt to deprive health care from 24 million people.  So after my friends on the other side of the aisle added yet another manager's amendment, bringing the total to five, and after stripping away essential health benefits, we are here this morning to push this extreme, dangerous, and callous bill under martial law.  But why are we really here? Is this bill actually about improving health care in this country? By my estimation, and by the analysis of virtually every healthcare group--Mr.McGovern has introduced some of them: hospitals, medical organizations, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--the answer is a flat-out, resounding no.  Premiums are going to rise. Millions upon millions of people will lose health coverage. Essential benefits will be stripped away, and 400 of the wealthiest Americans will get a substantial tax cut, while Medicaid is being cut by $880 billion.  Mr.Speaker, during that 13-hour marathon meeting that yielded nothing but a rule allowing Republicans to continue to ram this measure through Congress, I quoted from Scripture, from the King James Bible, Matthew 25:45. It says:       Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you,      inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you      did it not to me.  My friends on the other side of the aisle often cite Scripture in their legislative motivations. I ask them now: How does cutting the benefits from the least among us, while showering more wealth upon the wealthiest among us, square with these teachings?

So I noted that, in the Preamble to the Constitution, the document that guides our great Nation and that we all swear an oath to uphold, that we are entrusted to also, and I quote from the Preamble, ``promote the general welfare.''

Does stripping away of essential health benefits, which include maternity and newborn care, pediatric services, and emergency services, promote the general welfare?  Does cutting $880 billion from Medicaid promote the general welfare?  Does ensuring that, by 2026, 56 million people under the age of 64 will be left without coverage promote general welfare?  Finally, Mr.Speaker, in the debate at committee on this shameful bill, I answered the Republican charge that this bill was about freedom when I quoted a verse from Janis Joplin's ``Me and Bobby McGee.''

923,topic-id,1889,"Mr.President, I have been very interested in the minority leader's comments here this morning. I have high regard for him. We have worked together on a wide variety of issues, but I have to say that he is leading a party right now that is doing completely the opposite of what Democrats have done in the past when Republicans have had the Presidency and have had the privilege of appointing people to the Frankly, it has become kind of a war that we really don't need and something that literally, I think, is demeaning to the Senate and to this country.  I venture to say that it would be very difficult for anybody to find a better nominee for the Supreme Court than Neil I can't say that the Heritage Foundation was the one that carried the weight with regard to the choice of Neil Now, the Federalist Society did weigh in rather heavily, and there were around 21 absolutely top judges and lawyers who were on that list. I venture to say that anybody would have a very difficult time finding anything to criticize about that list other than on a partisan basis. Unfortunately for the Democrats, they lost the election.  Now keep in mind, all the current majority leader was saying was that we just weren't going to go with a Supreme Court Justice during an intensely hard-fought Presidential election year. In this century, that has been the rule.  The majority leader, Senator McConnell, knew that it was very likely, in the eyes of almost every pollster, that Hillary Clinton would win, and although he and I believed that nominee was a good, reasonable, moderate Democrat, we were quite sure that if Hillary got elected, she would not pick him. We were even working on trying to find a way so that she would have to pick him rather than pick another totally leftwing person for the  Unfortunately for the Democrats, Donald Trump proved to be a formidable candidate for President and won the election and, interestingly enough, as is his right as President, nominated Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme  Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, I would venture to say that it would be very difficult to find any candidate for the Supreme Court in this century who is any better than Neil Gorsuch is going to apply the law as written, not as he conjures up his ideas of what it should be. He is not going to do that. He is going to apply the law as written. He did that as a circuit court of appeals judge on the Tenth Circuit, my circuit. You would be hard-pressed to find a better qualified person. In fact, I do not think you could find a better qualified person for the Supreme Court than Neil  So what is all the whining about? They lost the election. They knew that this was going to be a big deal if they won and that the Republicans would pretty well have to go along with whomever they chose, but President Trump won the election, and he has a right to pick who should go on the Supreme In this case, I think he picked the most qualified person in the country for the Yes, he is conservative. Yes, he came up the hard way. Yes, he is not likely to be a liberal on the Court, but I would have to say that anybody this President would choose would not likely be a liberal on the In this case, the President chose one of the leading people in this country, one of the greatest lawyers in this country, one of the finest judges in this country, who has a record of working with Democrats on the bench, to become his choice for the U.Supreme  I know what is wrong with the Democrats on this. They lost, and it is a hard thing for them, and I do not blame them. It is a hard thing because they were so sure they would control this nominee to the Supreme Court and probably two to five more had Hillary Clinton been elected for two terms. But that is not the way the American people chose to vote.  I commend the American people for realizing that these things are very important. I have to say, in that last election, probably the single most important issue that drove it toward Donald Trump was, who is going to pick the Justices to the U.Supreme Court?  Republicans know and President Trump knows that he is not going to be able to put ideologues on the Court, and Neil Gorsuch is anything but an ideologue. He is as fine a judge as we have in this country, albeit conservative in nature. He has as fine an academic background as anybody on the Court--ever. On top of all of that, he is a terrific human being, a good husband, father, and a terrific judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of  To be honest with you, I thought it was really nice to have somebody picked from the West who might bring a western perspective of freedom into the judicial system, and I have no doubt that Neil Gorsuch will do that. To make this a big political issue, it seems to me, is beyond the pale, and it does bother me a great deal.  On another matter, Mr.President, by any measure, our efforts in this Congress to repeal harmful regulations through the Congressional Review Act have been historic. Prior to this year, only one CRA resolution--Congressional Review Act resolution--had ever been passed by Congress and signed by the We are an overregulated country like never before. This year, we have already successfully rolled back 11 regulations that were proposed and finalized under the previous administration. That is truly remarkable. I think our success in this endeavor can be attributed to a few factors.  First, in its last year, the Obama administration was particularly aggressive in its regulatory efforts. A number of regulations were finalized after the election, right up until the day President Trump was inaugurated. In fact, the regulation at issue today was finalized on January 19, the day before the inauguration. In other words, the Obama administration left Congress[[Page S2059]]and the new administration with a target-rich environment for CRA resolutions. There is no doubt what they were doing: They were scrambling to get as many changes as they could instead of allowing the new administration to take over.  Another important factor has been the realization by the American people that our economy--our workers, our businesses--is grossly overregulated. The regulatory state extracts hundreds of billions of dollars from our economy, much of it needlessly so. These CRA resolutions are part of a much broader effort to undo some of that damage.  Today I am pleased to be able to express my support for H.67, which will likely be the 12th CRA resolution we will pass this year. This resolution, once passed and signed, will roll back a last-second Department of Labor regulation that eliminated longstanding Federal protections for the retirement savings of private sector workers.  Specifically, the regulation builds off of a prior regulation that gave States a ``safe harbor'' from the protections workers have under ERISA if the government mandates that employers who do not offer retirement plans either set one up or join the government plan. These government-run plans do not have to be portable, nor do they have to permit workers to withdraw their savings at any time.  The resolution we are debating now would roll back the regulation that provided this authority to municipalities, such as New York Hopefully, sometime soon, the Senate will also debate and pass the CRA resolution relating to the original regulation, the one that focused on States, like California and  Combined, these regulations encourage State and municipal governments to impose conflicting and burdensome mandates on private sector businesses and to bar private workers' access to their retirement accounts, and they would let States invest private workers' retirement assets, ignoring provisions in Federal pension law that require prudent pension investment practices and that ban kickbacks and self-dealing. Think about that.  To be blunt, places like New York City should not just get a pass on investing potentially billions of dollars in private worker retirement assets without regard to Federal rules that require prudent investment practices--rules designed to protect the retirement nest eggs of hard-working  Now, do not get me wrong--I am all for increasing coverage for employees in workplace retirement programs. In fact, it is something I have been working on for some time with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Last Congress, the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, unanimously approved the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2016, which is a bipartisan bill that will increase voluntary retirement savings. It includes a number of provisions from a bill I introduced a few years before that, one that received high marks from analysts and stakeholders in the retirement-security community. My bill and others like it provide workable, voluntary solutions to give more workers access to retirement plans. This approach is far better than the one taken by the Obama administration and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, which would purposefully take us down the path toward government-mandated and government-run retirement plans.  The retirement savings system that has been in place for decades now is one of the clearest examples we have to demonstrate the superiority of the free market over government mandates. Private retirement savings vehicles, including 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, which have been encouraged but not mandated by Federal tax laws, have produced nearly $14 trillion--that is trillion dollars--in wealth and savings for the middle class.  I know some have concerns about the federalism implications in rolling back these Department of Labor regulations. However, let's be clear: Prior to the implementation of these regulations, States were free to pass laws to encourage retirement savings opportunities for private sector workers, and they will be free to do so after this CRA resolution is signed by President They will simply have to observe the longstanding rules and protections that have been in place under Federal pension laws, including the ban on self-dealing and the duty to invest prudently, and they will not be able to offer plans on an uneven playing field that favors government retirement plans over those produced in a free, private sector market.  Unfortunately, I have to wonder why States and municipalities want to do away with these protections in the first place. I also have to wonder why they think they will be able to produce better results than the private retirement savings system, which thus far has been an unqualified success, benefiting workers and employers alike. I also have to wonder how some of my colleagues who value consumer financial protection, as I do, would want to see the continuation of rules that erode protections for workers and future retirees.  The first step in undoing these harmful regulations is with the passage of H.67. Toward that end, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

950,topic-id,2152,"Mr.President, I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for the wonderful remarks he has made. They are right on point.  Last week's Judiciary Committee hearing on Judge Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination made two things abundantly clear. The first is that Judge Neil Gorsuch is a superb, highly qualified nominee. Second, with the possibility of the first partisan filibuster in the history of a Supreme Court nominee, I have come to the conclusion that some Democrats would do almost anything to keep us from having an impartial, independent judiciary.  As I explained at the start of the hearing last week, qualifications for judicial service include both legal experience and judicial philosophy. Legal experience looks at the nominee's past accomplishments in the law, while judicial philosophy anticipates the nominee's future judicial service.  Judge Gorsuch's legal experience is among the most impressive that I have seen in my 40 years on the Judiciary He is truly an impressive man. This is no doubt why the American Bar Association easily and unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch its highest ``well qualified'' rating, the highest rating it can give. I certainly have had my differences with the ABA, because at times they appear to let political or ideological considerations influence their rating. I mention their rating now because my Democrat colleagues, including Senators Leahy and Schumer, have called the ABA's rating ``the gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominees.  The ABA testified about their rating at last week's hearing, explaining that they sought input from more than 5,000 people throughout the legal world who would have personal knowledge about Judge That is about as broad a group as I have ever heard of. They assembled 40 scholars and nationally recognized Supreme Court practitioners to review his judicial opinions, other writings, and speeches. The ABA's 1,000-page report concluded that Judge Gorsuch meets the ``very high standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.''  Editorial boards across America took notice as Judge Gorsuch demonstrated such qualities to everyone.  The Denver Post said that Judge Gorsuch ``possesses the fairness, independence, and opened-mindedness necessary to make him a marvelous addition to the Supreme Court.''  The Detroit News said that Judge Gorsuch ``is proving himself an even tempered, deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate.''  The Chicago Tribune said that Judge Gorsuch's critics ``suggest that they fear Gorsuch won't follow the law, but the opposite is more true. They fear he will. Gorsuch should be confirmed.''  The second and more important qualification for judicial service is the nominee's judicial philosophy or his understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our system of government. This is ground zero in the conflict over the appointment of judges. America's Founders were clear about their design for the judicial branch as part of the system of government they established. Central in this design is the separation of powers. Government power is divided among three branches and is supposed to stay that way. As a result, what the legislature does in making law is designed to be different than what the judiciary does in interpreting and applying that law. This design for government is necessary for the liberty that we all enjoy. Change the design and sacrifice the liberty it makes possible.  Specifically for our purpose today, this design provides the job description for judges. They interpret and apply written laws such as statutes and the Constitution to decide cases, and they must do so impartially, deliberately removing their own views, preferences, or agendas from the judicial equation. That is exactly the kind of Justice that Neil Gorsuch will be and has been. Professor Jonathan Turley, a well-known constitutional law expert, told the Judiciary Committee that, like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch has a well-defined judicial philosophy with a record of well-considered writings both as a judge and as an author. In short, concluded Professor Turley, ``we have a very good idea of who Judge Gorsuch is and the type of Justice he will be.'' He will be an impartial Justice who takes the law as he finds it, applies it objectively to decide cases, and leaves the decision about changing the law to the people and their elected representatives.  This brings me to the second thing that the Judiciary Committee hearing revealed last week. I said at the start of the hearing that the confirmation process reveals the kind of judge that Senators want to see appointed. And it certainly did. Judge Gorsuch's opponents seem determined to oppose an impartial and independent judiciary. In fact, it looks to me like they want the opposite--a judiciary that is partial and dependent. They want judges to decide cases with deliberate regard to the parties and with determined attention to the political interests that their decisions will promote.  This is the 14th Supreme Court confirmation process in which I have participated, and I cannot remember Senators opposing more strongly the basic notion that judges must impartially apply the law.  It is important to point out, of course, that Democrats' objection to judicial independence has, to be charitable, not always been consistent. In 2009, for example, Senator Schumer introduced Justice Sonya Sotomayor to the Judiciary Committee for her confirmation hearing. Senator Schumer was a distinguished member of the committee at the time. He praised Justice Sotomayor for, as he described it, carefully applying the law even when it meant ruling against ``so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was then. This is now. Last week, Democrats turned the Schumer standard on its head, cherry-picking a few of Judge Gorsuch's thousands of cases to criticize him for ruling against sympathetic litigants.  Every Federal judge takes an oath to administer justice without respect to persons and to discharge his judicial[[Page S2083]]duties impartially. The ABA's Model Code of Judicial Conduct spells out that this includes a duty not to make commitments about issues that may come up in future cases.  When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared before the Judiciary Committee in 1993, she took a firm stand. She said: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.''  Every Supreme Court nominee of either party has taken this same position. To me, this simply shows how much these nominees, most of whom are sitting judges already, care about their impartiality and the fairness it provides to litigants.  I think it would baffle our fellow citizens to suggest that judges should, in effect, prejudge cases before they even come up or publicly take sides on issues that could later require their judicial decision. Our constituents would think it crazy to say that judges should not keep an open mind or that judges need not be impartial.  Today, however, Democrats say they will oppose Judge Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination unless he spells out those views, unless he provides those same forecasts and previews. In other words, Democrats consider the impartiality they applauded in Justice Ginsburg to be a liability in Judge To most people, fairness, openmindedness, and impartiality are qualities we need in our judges. To some Democrats, they are obstacles to be overcome, I might say, on the way to a fully politicized judiciary. What do my Democratic colleagues have to fear from judges who are truly impartial? I mean, I don't see where the argument really is.  Another tactic last week was to talk about people who had not been nominated and who were not even in the room. Committee Democrats, for example, talked about President Trump and a few of his advisers more than 80 times over just 3 days. They also decried the efforts of grassroots activists working on behalf of Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It mattered not that the nominee had no connection whatsoever with those particular efforts. No, Democrats warned of the ``extreme special interest groups'' that supposedly advised the President about filling this Supreme Court vacancy. They talked about so-called ``dark money'' contributed to such groups by undisclosed donors.  I would not go so far as to directly accuse anyone of hypocrisy or of changing their tune based on ideology or political party. I would not do that. I would observe, however, that one group invited by Democrats to testify against the Gorsuch nomination was particularly vocal about condemning ``big money corrupting our politics.'' It turns out that this group was cited by the Center for Public Integrity in January as an opponent of dark money even though the group itself accepts shadowy funds and refuses to fully disclose its own donors.  Next week, the Judiciary Committee will report the Gorsuch nomination to the Senate floor, where the same tactics will be in full view. Democrats are already claiming that the threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees is 60 votes. Where did they get that from? They may wish this were the rule, at least for Republican nominees, but they know that is not true. They know it.  Democrats have been playing this game for years, embracing one standard when it suits them, only to do an about-face later. It may be just a coincidence, but the flip-flopping follows an eerily similar pattern to election cycles when different parties control the White But, like I said, that may be just a coincidence.  What I do know is that Senator Schumer voted 25 times to filibuster judicial nominees of President George Then, when nomination filibusters had declined under President Obama, he voted to abolish them. Now, with a Republican in the White House, he is back on the filibuster train. He was against judicial filibusters before he was for them before he was against them.  Why not have a vigorous debate followed by an up-or-down vote? The 1987 nomination of Robert Bork was controversial, yet there was no cloture vote, even though he was defeated. The 1991 nomination of Clarence Thomas was controversial, yet there was no cloture vote, even though he was confirmed.  Republicans have never even attempted a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Most recently, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid said in 2010 that he would file cloture on the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Republican leaders, including our former colleague Senator Jeff Sessions, told him that filing cloture would be completely unnecessary.  The truth is that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been defeated by a partisan filibuster. The only reason Democrats are choosing to push us in that direction is that their leftwing groups have told them to do so.  Judge Gorsuch's approach to judging empowers the American people and their elected representatives. It does so by taking seriously what they do. He takes the words of the statutes they enact and the Constitution they established as having substance and actually meaning what they say. That is the respect that our system of separated branches requires that each give the other.  Last week's hearing confirmed for all to see that Judge Gorsuch has the legal experience and judicial philosophy and temperament to make him fully qualified to serve on the Supreme It also exposed the fact that some of my colleagues see an impartial and independent judiciary as a threat rather than as an indispensable support for our liberty.  I have been kind of shocked at the turnaround by some of our Democratic colleagues--not all of them but some of them--that how, if it is their judgeship nominee, these rules do not apply that they are now trying to apply to Judge  I have seen a lot of nominees in my day and an awful lot of nominees to the Supreme I have never seen one any better than Judge Neil He is totally prepared for the job. He is an outstanding lawyer with great experience. He is a brilliant judge, someone who will enhance the Supreme Court and not deteriorate it, who deserves to be on the Supreme Thank goodness the President has seen fit to put him there.  I hope our colleagues will think it through because we should not be politicizing these judgeships like has been done recently. Frankly, we should never politicize the Supreme Court nomination process. It is not just because the President is a Republican; it is because that is the way I have always approached it. I think that is the way most everybody in this body has always approached it.  I hope people will think it through and vote for Neil He deserves their vote. He will be a great Justice on the Supreme He is going to make it one way or the other, and I hope my colleagues on the other side realize that and will dispense with some of this garbage that has been used against Judge  I yield the floor.

1235,topic-id,1919,"Mr.President, as we approach the end of another week in the Senate with a 2-week recess on the horizon, I think it is a good time to reflect on where we are on various high-profile efforts and to talk about the pathways forward.  As is generally the case when any new administration comes into office, the Republican majorities in both the House and Senate began 2017 with an ambitious agenda in order to make good on the promises we have made to the American people over the last several years. Many of the key items on the agenda fall squarely in the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair. That being the case, my colleagues on the committee and I have been hard at work, trying to find the right solutions on things like healthcare, tax reform, and trade policy.  I don't think I am going to surprise anyone when I say it hasn't been easy. Honestly, I think that might be the biggest understatement of the year.  Things have been difficult for a number of reasons. One reason is that we are coming off of a bitter election year, one that shocked a number of our colleagues. After a hotly contested campaign, it can sometimes take a while for things to return to normal. However, I don't think that excuses the tactics and rhetoric we have seen from our friends on the other side of the aisle.[[Page S2145]]  In any of these big-ticket policy efforts, whether we are talking about repealing and replacing ObamaCare, fixing the Tax Code, or updating America's trade policy, cooperation between the legislative and the executive branches is key. My Democratic colleagues know this, which, I suppose, is probably the reason they appeared to be bound and determined to prevent any meaningful cooperation from happening.  Now don't get me wrong; I don't expect my friends to change their views and back policies that they find disagreeable. However, you would think, at the very least, that they would allow the new President to get his team in place, a courtesy that has typically been extended to past Presidents, regardless of party. Yet over the last few months, we have seen a systematic effort from our Democratic colleagues to smear, attack, and undermine the vast majority of executive branch nominees. In many cases, after the baseless attacks have failed to gain traction, they have used every procedural tool at their disposal, including surprise boycotts of committee markups, in order to slow down the confirmation process.  This level of obstruction with regard to nominees is unprecedented. And I think it is safe to say that it has slowed our efforts down somewhat, which, I suppose, is the exact reason our colleagues have taken this path. Still, despite these childish tactics, the teams are coming together, and we are moving forward in a number of key areas. As I said, it still hasn't been easy, but to paraphrase a number of important figures, nothing worth doing is ever easy.  For example, on healthcare, I think it is safe to say that the ongoing effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare took a hit last week, but I don't think that has weakened anyone's resolve. ObamaCare is a disaster, and one way or another, it has to go away. The American people are demanding that we take action, and I expect that the volume of those demands is only going to go up.  I commend Speaker Ryan for his efforts thus far, and I commend all my colleagues in the House and Senate for their commitment to repealing and replacing the so-called Affordable Care I remain hopeful that in the near future we can find a workable path forward, and that includes my Democratic colleagues as well.  On tax reform we have some indications that the Trump administration intends to be more actively engaged in finding and developing a path forward. I have said for years that if we are going to be successful in tax reform--a goal shared by Members of both parties--it is going to take Presidential leadership and cooperation by both parties. While President Obama was generally unwilling to meaningfully engage on tax reform, President Trump and his team appear to be anxious to drive the process, and I welcome that.  As with healthcare reform, there are some differences of opinion with regard to tax reform. Still, I think there is a remarkable amount of agreement, at least among Republicans, on the major issues we need to deal with to fix our broken Tax  Overall, I would say that the Republicans in the Senate, the House, and the White House agree on about 80 percent of the major tax reform issues, and a number of key and fundamental questions are answered in that 80 percent. For example, we all generally agree on the need for comprehensive reform. We agree on the need to bring down tax rates for businesses and job creators. We agree that we need a simplified rate structure on the individual side. We agree on the need to fix the international tax rules to level the playing field for American companies and encourage more investment in the United States, and we generally agree on key process issues, including the appropriate revenue baselines and the use of macroeconomic analysis in budget scoring.  Still, that 20 percent of issues where we don't necessarily agree is not insignificant. We will need to find a consensus path forward on those issues as well. One area where we have yet to reach a consensus--and the one getting the most attention--is on the proposed border adjustment tax. People have a number of opinions about this, and I have had numerous people in my office on both sides of the issue. As I said, there are a number of opinions on this proposal, and they have been more than willing to express them publicly. As for myself, I am anxious to see what it looks like once our friends in the House put it all together.  It is too early for me to express a definitive position now. So at this point, all I will say is that I have some basic questions about the proposal.  For example, who will ultimately bear the tax? To what extent will it be borne by consumers, workers, shareholders, and, of course, foreigners?  Another question: Is the proposal consistent with our international trade obligations?  Finally, since border adjustability will likely be a significant shift in business tax policy, would it require us to make adjustments to ensure that we don't unduly increase the tax burden on specific industries? If so, what adjustments would be necessary, and how would they be structured?  I look forward to receiving more details on this proposal. However, here in the Senate, we also have some work to do, and I have been actively working with the members of the Finance Committee to find various solutions to our Nation's tax problems.  At the end of the day, I don't think it will surprise anyone to hear me say that I believe we are going to need to have a robust and substantive tax reform process in the In my view, it is not realistic to think that the Senate will simply take up and pass a House bill without our Members having a significant input on the substance of the bill. That is how the Congress is supposed to operate, and I think that is what will produce the best result in the end.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House on tax reform. I also appreciate the willingness of the new Treasury Secretary and the President's National Economic Council to lead on this effort, and I look forward to continuing to work with them as well.  I will also say this: My hope is that both parties can find a way to work together on tax reform. While we have procedural tools at our disposal to get tax reform legislation through Congress with strictly Republican votes, I personally believe that it would be better to find a bipartisan path forward. A bipartisan bill would allow us to put in place more lasting reforms and give the overall effort additional credibility.  I am sure there are some who think it is impossible for Republicans and Democrats to work together on something of this magnitude, but I have been in the Senate for a long time, and I think my record for bipartisanship speaks for itself. I believe we can and should work together, and I am willing to talk and work with anyone who is willing to set politics aside and engage in good faith on these matters.  I have been banging a drum on tax reform for 6 years now, and throughout that time, I have invited my Democratic colleagues to join in this effort. I will do so again today. Hopefully, some of our colleagues on the other side will take me up on this offer.  Finally, I want to say a few words about U.trade policy. Trade is another area in which President Trump has some ambitious plans and in which, up to now, progress has been hindered. Before I delve into that, let me reiterate a key point.  In 2015, Congress outlined its trade priorities with our legislation to renew the trade promotion authority, which was signed into law by President The TPA statute gives clear guidance as to what a trade agreement should look like if it is going to win Congress's approval.  President Trump was fortunate to come into office with TPA already in effect, and I am committed to working with him to enact trade agreements that meet those standards established by the TPA law. When it comes to new trade agreements or revisions to modernize existing trade agreements, that is my top priority as chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade policy. Our trade laws are designed to give Congress a voice in both the negotiation and implementation of trade agreements.  In addition to priorities and objectives outlined under TPA, there is the Office of the U.Trade Representative, which is intended to be the chief intermediary between Congress and, of course, the administration on trade[[Page S2146]]policy matters. In other words, in order for the two branches to effectively work together on trade, the Office of the USTR needs to be fully functional and fully staffed.  Unfortunately, up to now, some on the other side have been making unreasonable and wholly unrelated demands in relation to the confirmation of President Trump's nominee to be USTR even though he has support from Members of both parties.

714,topic-id,2283,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today, not as a member of any one committee or political party but as a gravely concerned  On a seemingly daily--or even hourly--basis, there is a new revelation about the Trump campaign's possible ties to or even coordination with Russia's interference in our Presidential election last year. With these constant reports coming out, it can be difficult to see through all the smoke in the air.  However, what is clear is that we must get to the bottom of what exactly happened. I know that the White House and some in Congress are furiously working to sweep this under the rug, but only the truth will serve as a public means to move past this crisis for our democracy.  That is why I come to the Senate floor today, to address this issue before my colleagues and to help the American people sort through the details of what we know to be the undisputed facts. We know without a doubt, based on the assessment of credible intelligence, that the Russian Government hacked into Presidential campaign infrastructure and sought not only to damage Hillary Clinton but to try to help elect Donald  Russian intelligence operatives hacked into the email servers of both of our two major political parties. They chose to selectively leak information that damaged one Presidential candidate and favored the other. This is not a partisan political assessment. This is the plain truth as proven by credible intelligence gathered by the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and the military's Cyber In addition, 17 U.intelligence agencies issued a statement expressing their unanimous assessment that Moscow had penetrated State election voting centers.  During an open hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee in January of this year, FBI Director James Comey said: ``There were intrusions and attempted intrusions at the state level voter registration databases.'' Director Comey said that there was no evidence of activity on election day related to this voter registration data. However, this clearly demonstrates that this data may be vulnerable to future cyber attacks and manipulations by foreign hackers.  What happened in this last year's election is already disturbing enough. In testimony during the same Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said:[[Page S2041]]         We have high confidence that President Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.Presidential      election. The goals of this campaign were to undermine public      faith in the U.Democratic process, denigrate Secretary      [Hillary] Clinton and harm her electability and potential      presidency.  He continued: ``Putin and the Russian government also developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''  That shocking revelation at the very least begged for deeper investigation and accountability to protect our democratic institutions from foreign interference moving forward. After all, Russia did not do this to help the Republican Russia did this to help  I don't want foreign powers putting their thumb on the scales for Democrats or Republicans in our elections. Our democracy hinges on our ability to protect the voices of Americans to choose our own leaders. Nothing could be more fundamental in democracy.  You can see similar ongoing Russian efforts to work seeking to influence and undermine democratic elections in France, Germany, and throughout the West, in addition to the former Soviet states, which is why we have to take this seriously and to see through the latest news cycle, political commentary, or tweet and remain focused on following the facts, wherever they may lead us.  Unfortunately, the facts suggest that we not only need to hold the Russians accountable but that we also have reason to look into possible ties between key members of the Trump campaign and their connections to the Russian actors who we know meddled in our election.  The obvious question Americans are demanding an answer to is this: Did the Trump campaign cooperate--or even coordinate--with the Russians in their effort to help Donald Trump? It is a logical question that has striking implications not only for the Trump administration but also for our democracy as a whole.  The President and his senior advisers--both on the campaign and now in the administration--have vehemently denied any Russian connections whatsoever. Back in November, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokesman said: ``There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.''  A month ago, President Trump responded to a question in a press conference about whether anyone in his campaign had been in contact with Russia, saying:       Nobody that I know of . . . Russia is a ruse. I have      nothing to do with  I truly wish that that was what the facts had shown, but at nearly every turn, there is evidence--and, when forced, admission--that there were, in fact, communications and contact with the Russians that are not only unprecedented but truly hard to believe and to understand.  Contrary to denials, we know that senior leaders and surrogates in then-Candidate Donald Trump's campaign had contact with the Russian Government and actors behind the Russian cyber attacks and leaks.  One campaign adviser, Carter Page, traveled to Moscow in July of 2016 on a trip approved by the Trump campaign. During the trip, Page delivered a lecture that slammed U.policy toward Three days later, at the Republican National Convention, Trump campaign aides stepped in to oppose the inclusion of language in the RNC platform that called on the U.Government to send weapons to our ally Ukraine in response to Russian military aggression and the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukrainian  Despite Trump campaign denials of involvement at the time, former campaign aides have since come forward to say that, yes, they were involved in defeating that language in the platform.  While this was going on, again, despite denials to the contrary, we know that senior Trump advisers met with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak on the sidelines of the Republican  We know that then-Senator Sessions, a senior campaign surrogate, also met with Kislyak in his personal Senate office later in  Again, this communication was uncovered despite Attorney General Sessions denying it had ever taken place.  During his Senate confirmation hearing in January, then-Senator Sessions said in response to a pointed question about how he would respond as Attorney General to any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian Government in the course of the campaign:       I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been      called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I      didn't have--did not have communications with the  Then the day after the Republican National Convention, WikiLeaks posted nearly 20,000 emails hacked and stolen by Russian intelligence from the DNC server.  After this, Donald Trump, during a press conference in late July, called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's private email, saying:       I will tell you this--Russia, if you're listening, I hope      you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I      think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.  Although Trump later claimed to be joking, we now have reason to believe that one of his friends and advisers, Roger Stone, was in contact with the Russian hackers behind the cyber attacks. Stone boasted in a speech in August 2016 that he had communicated with WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange and that more damaging documents would be forthcoming in what he called an ``October surprise.''  Stone also admitted to communicating via Twitter with the Russian hacker behind the breaches who went by the moniker ``Guccifer 2.0.'' Stone tweeted out predictions that Hillary Clinton senior campaign aide John Podesta's personal emails would soon be published, saying: ``Trust me, it will soon be Podesta's time in the barrel.'' Stone also tweeted: ``I have total confidence that WikiLeaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon.''  Soon after this, WikiLeaks released its first batch of John Podesta's stolen emails and continued releasing more on a daily basis up until election day.  In the face of these facts, the Trump administration's story has evolved from rejecting Russian influence on the election entirely to denying any connection or communication with Russian actors, to asserting that this contact was, in fact, innocent or routine and that Americans should simply trust that there was nothing more going on. But to ask the public to trust you when you have falsely denied that the communication occurred in the first place is absurd on its face and, in fact, it is a plausible reason to suspect possible coordination.  After the election, we now know that President-Elect Trump's appointed National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and Trump's senior aide and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had a secret meeting with Russian Ambassador Kislyak and that Flynn later conducted phone calls with Kislyak that included discussion of rolling back sanctions for  Flynn has since resigned as National Security Advisor after having lied about the content of his conversations with  Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia due to his undisclosed meetings with the same Russian  Last week, FBI Director James Comey confirmed to the public that the FBI is currently conducting a counterintelligence investigation into possible coordination between President Trump's campaign and the  I will repeat that because I fear that the public is becoming desensitized to the gravity of what we are learning about. The President's campaign officials are under investigation by the FBI for possible links with the Russian Government, including whether they coordinated with one another to impact our Presidential election.  We also saw reports last week that before his time on the Trump campaign, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort created and then sold the Russians what appears to effectively be a playbook on how to undermine Western democracy and to further the interests of the Russian Government, including here in the United  Manafort's reported recommendations to use political campaign tactics, establish front groups, and manipulate the press cycle are strikingly similar[[Page S2042]]to the actual tactics that we know the Russians employed to undermine the 2016 Presidential election.  The Trump administration's repeated attempts to now distance itself from its former campaign chairman, a man who played a central role in the Trump campaign, is indicative of its desperate attempts to cover up the facts.  The facts are there if we just look.  The Trump campaign denied having worked to scrub the RNC platform to be friendlier to Russia but then later had to admit to having done so.  Michael Flynn denied conversations with the Russian Ambassador and then had to resign when that turned out to be a lie.  Attorney General Sessions denied having conversations with the Russians but later recused himself from the investigation after having to admit that he secretly met on several occasions with the Russian  The Trump campaign and Trump's advisers denied any communications with the Russians, but it turns out they personally met with the Russian Ambassador at the RNC, communicated with Russian hackers, and appear to have had advanced notice about impending DNC and Clinton leaks.  All of this culminates with the news that the Trump campaign chairman sold the Russians a playbook on how to conduct a strikingly similar influence operation to undermine democracy and promote the Putin agenda throughout the  This is all a complicated web of connections that we need to piece together. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am committed to finding the answers that the American people deserve and to working together with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put our Nation first and to make sure that we get to the bottom of this.  We need to do everything possible to get to the objective truth. That includes subpoenaing President Trump's tax returns and financial statements so that we can follow the money and determine who holds the debt behind the President's complex international business empire. That includes calling President Trump's associates, such as Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, Jared Kushner, Jeff Sessions, and Michael Flynn to testify before the Senate Intelligence  But with the incredible amount of information and intelligence that we need to look through, I believe we also should be open to an independent, nonpartisan commission designed solely to investigate what happened.  During the investigation of Watergate and the ensuing scandal, Congress conducted a thorough select oversight investigation at the same time that an independent special prosecutor was pursuing a case to uncover the truth. All of those avenues proved to be essential to discovering the crimes and coverup that were committed.  If we do not take this seriously, our fundamental democratic institutions are at risk. History will judge severely those of us in this body tasked with finding the whole truth and determining conclusively whether or not associates of the Trump campaign coordinated or cooperated with this effort to undermine our American democracy.  We cannot allow political pressure or unsubstantiated distractions to get in the way of simply following the facts.  I don't think it is hyperbolic to state that the fate of our democracy depends on our ability to thoroughly and carefully get to the truth here. Until we are able to find out the full extent of Russia's operations and ensure that we set up protections against similar actions going forward, our democratic institutions will remain vulnerable.  I want my constituents in New Mexico and all of the American people to know that I remain committed to seeing this important mission through and following the facts, wherever they may lead.

941,topic-id,1586,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments my colleague from Colorado has made on energy. I have an energy speech here, also. We have the same goals, maybe coming from different perspectives, but both the Senator from Colorado and I are trying to achieve the same thing.  I appreciate his hard work. He and I have worked well together over the years on the Finance Committee, as he mentioned, with the investment tax credits to make alternative energy viable products and industries in both of our States and across this country, so I appreciate his hard work.  Mr.President, I come to the floor of the U.Senate today to discuss an issue that is extremely important to the State of Nevada, and that is Yucca  For over 30 years, those two words, ``Yucca Mountain,'' have incited frustration and anger for Nevadans across my It is not just a mountain 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas; it represents a decade-long fight by some in Washington to ``wrong Nevada.''  In 1982, the Congress approved the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and charged the Department of Energy with finding a long-term storage site for the disposal of spent nuclear material. At the time, Yucca Mountain was one of the many proposed geological sites to investigate.  Unfortunately, in 1987, the act was amended to concentrate only on one place, Yucca Nevada, a State without any nuclear powerplants, was legally compelled to bear the sole burden of long-term storage of all of the Nation's nuclear waste. This decision was made on bad politics; it was not made on sound science. Ever since, the debate on solutions to this problem has been one-sided, and the study of alternative solutions has been curtailed.  Instead of honoring Nevada's persistent scientific and procedural objections to the repository, the Federal Government has spent decades of time and wasted billions of dollars to design and permit Yucca Mountain, all without any notion that Nevada would consent to the project.  I have spent the past decade in Congress successfully fighting off efforts to force this project on Nevada, and I will continue this fight for as long as I serve my  I want to be clear: Nuclear power is an important part of our Nation's energy portfolio. I am one of the most outspoken Republicans in Congress advocating to make our Nation's energy cleaner and more affordable. Nuclear energy, which represents about 20 percent of our Nation's power production, plays an important role in providing carbon emission-free baseload energy in many States, but Nevada--again, a State without a nuclear powerplant--should not have to shoulder the Nation's entire waste burden.[[Page S2075]]  We have pursued other strategies to meet Nevada's energy needs. I can share a couple of those examples with you. More than two-thirds of Nevada's energy is produced by natural gas-fired powerplants. Just 2 weeks ago, I was at a groundbreaking at the Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project, the first-ever utility scale powerplant to be built on Tribal land. This project will produce 250 megawatts of clean energy capable of generating enough clean energy to power an estimated 111,000 homes.  Last March, I joined with the Italian Prime Minister in celebrating the world's first combined solar-geothermal plant near Fallon, This facility provides 26 megawatts of solar photovoltaic, 2 megawatts of solar thermal, and 33 megawatts of geothermal energy to Nevada customers.  Nearly half of the geothermal plants producing baseload clean energy in this country are located in Nevada alone. So overall, more than 2,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewable energy in Nevada, enough to power nearly 1 million homes, has been built to meet Nevada's needs. That includes 19 geothermal energy plants, 12 solar projects, 6 hydro facilities, 4 biomass or methane projects, 1 large wind farm, and 1 energy recovery station. These are just some of the examples we are doing in Yet they continue to try to ram Yucca Mountain down our throats as if we are not doing enough.  As we examine viable solutions to the waste problem, it is important to note that there are some promising technological developments that could fundamentally change the Nation's waste storage needs. There are new reactor technologies that could repurpose previously generated spent fuel and produce carbon-free electricity with little or no waste. International research and development on innovative storage solutions and recycling processes could also be part of that solution.  Given the Yucca-centric strategy's previous failures, it would be logical for the government to try something new--some of these strategies that show promise--but, no, not here in Washington is at it again. Apparently, nearly 30 years of wasted time and billions of squandered taxpayer dollars is, simply, not enough.  The Department of Energy recently submitted what they call a skinny budget, including $120 million, in part, to restart licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. That $120 million is a lot of money in itself, but let's be clear that it is just a fraction of the true costs.  Nevada has made it clear that it will contest each and every one of the 200-plus elements of any license application. State and Federal officials have estimated that the licensing process for Yucca Mountain will take 4 to 5 years and cost in excess of $1.6 billion.  In these difficult times, I ask my colleagues: Is it financially prudent to invest over $1.6 billion in any program that has not yielded results in over 30 years?  In case there is any confusion, I want to make sure everybody understands that Nevada's position has not changed and that it is not going to change on this issue. Our Governor, Brian Sandoval, continues to strongly oppose the project. In fact, he shares my same sentiment, and he shared it with me a few weeks ago when he stated:       I will vigorously fight the storage of high-level nuclear      waste in Any attempt to resurrect this ill-conceived      project will be met with relentless opposition and maximum      resources.  Every serious presumed candidate for Governor in 2018--both Republicans and Democrats--strongly opposes Yucca Nevada's attorney general, Adam Laxalt, recently requested $7.2 million of State resources over the next 2 years to represent the State's interests in the licensing process over Yucca Mountain, which he called ``a poster child of federal overreach.'' Soon, our legislature will reaffirm the State's opposition to the project with the passage of Assembly Joint Resolution 10.  To sum it up, it will cost at least $1.6 billion just to get through the application process. Think about that. It will take $1.6 billion just to get through the process, to get the applications ready, let alone to get the storage facility actually operational.  Make no mistake about it. I will continue to lead the Nevada congressional delegation's effort to stymie any misguided effort to spend one more Federal dollar on the Yucca Mountain repository. It is fiscally irresponsible and, simply, will not solve this important public policy issue that faces our  I implore my colleagues to work with me in a pragmatic way to solve our Nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste storage problem that we have.  There is an old adage, and we have all heard it: The definition of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is called insanity. Efforts by the executive branch and some Members of Congress to direct billions more toward a repository that will never be built is just that--insanity.  Our Nation cannot fully move forward with viable solutions until Congress moves past Yucca Last year, the Department of Energy began a consent-based siting initiative to find alternative storage and disposal facilities. Identifying communities that are willing to be hosts for long-term repositories, rather than forcing them upon States that have outright opposed such sites for decades, is the only sustainable path forward.  I wholeheartedly support these efforts. In fact, I introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this year, the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, to codify it into law. This strategy was wisely recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future--a 15-member, bipartisan group that is tasked by the Federal Government to develop feasible solutions to nuclear waste disposal. This type of open process ensures all Americans have a meaningful voice in the process if their communities are being considered for a future nuclear waste repository.  I am confident that the government can find safe sites through the careful consideration of all alternatives that are based on credible scientific information and not by politicians here in Washington, Let's stop the insanity. The administration and congressional Yucca advocates should focus their efforts on practical solutions and not on more of the same.  First, let's advance innovative energy technologies that repurpose and reduce spent fuel.  Second, let's invest in the research and development of recycling and alternative storage methods.  Third and most importantly, let's identify safe and viable alternatives for the storage of nuclear waste that remains in areas that are willing to house it.  These are worthwhile initiatives that actually, to use a football analogy, ``move the ball down the field.'' For far too long, our Nation has been going ``three and out'' because Washington keeps trying to run the same, stale game plan.  I am working diligently on feasible solutions to this important problem, and I urge my colleagues here today, on the floor of the U.Senate, to join me in that fight. I stand here, ready to work for what is best for my State and what is best for our  I yield the floor.

He was a graduate of Kahuku High School and the Church College, the forerunner to Brigham Young University in Laie, Eni was a passionate advocate for indigenous peoples including native Whether it was Federal recognition or health and housing programs for native Hawaiians, Hawaii could always count on Eni's outspoken support and assistance.

Of course, he also served his American Samoa constituents in Congress with distinction for two decades.

710,topic-id,1686,"Mr.President, during last week's hearing on Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, I raised serious concerns about what is at stake for the future of our country. It is a mistake to think that the confirmation process for a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court is only about the nominee. It isn't.  The real focus and the real heart of this decision lies in the struggles that working families, women, people of color, the differently abled, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, students, seniors, and our Native people face every single day. These are the everyday Americans who will be impacted by the decisions Justice Gorsuch would make. These are the people who would have been hurt by Donald Trump and the Congressional Republicans in their failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care  Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress fought for a plan that would callously throw Americans by the tens of millions out in the cold without health insurance and would make the lives and health of millions more precarious. It was only through the voices of Americans who were loud and steadfast in confronting TrumpCare that TrumpCare failed. These are the people for whom the need for justice is often most urgent. An understanding of these people, their lives, and how they would be impacted by the Court is what I found to be missing from Judge Gorsuch's view of the law. It is these same voices I am listening to now.  Judge Gorsuch should have been more open with the Judiciary Committee about how he would approach the difficult and important cases that come before the Supreme But time and again, Judge Gorsuch avoided answering questions, telling us his judicial philosophy and his view of the law were irrelevant to our consideration of his nomination.  The well-funded campaign to put Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court fueled by millions of dollars of money from unnamed donors has attempted to create a narrative about Judge Gorsuch and the stakes of this nomination. This is a narrative woven with Ivy League credentials and endorsements but not revealing at all about Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy--the heart he would bring to his view of the law.  During the hearing, many of my Republican colleagues echoed the view that credentials are enough and that our real questions about Judge Gorsuch's record and philosophy are somehow irrelevant or even inappropriate. Certainly, Judge Gorsuch did his part, telling us time and again in his words, his views, his writings, and his clearly expressed personal views that these writings had no relevance to what he would do as a judge. I disagree.  In my view, there is a great deal of difference between how Judge Gorsuch, as Justice Gorsuch, would approach the kinds of tough cases that reach the Supreme Court and how, say, a Justice Merrick Garland would approach these cases.  We know that Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, both legendary jurists and close friends, would reach dramatically different results in cases that matter deeply in the lives of millions--cases like Shelby County, like Lilly Ledbetter, like Hobby Lobby, like Roe v. Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg differ in how they view important cases that came before them. That is why a Justice's judicial philosophy is important in our considerations.  Donald Trump knew this, too, when he set forth his clear litmus test for his Supreme Court pick. To paraphrase the President, he wanted a Justice who would adhere to a broad view of the Second Amendment, who believes corporations are entitled to ``religious freedom'' at the expense of the rights of their employees, and who would overturn Roe v. Wade, to quote the President, ``automatically.''  In Judge Gorsuch, Donald Trump selected a nominee who passed his litmus test. When we asked Judge Gorsuch about his opinions in specific cases like that involving the terrible choice facing Alfonse Maddin between freezing to death or being fired, the judge told us we should look instead at his whole record. When I examined his whole record, I saw too little regard for the real-world impact of his decisions and a refusal to look beyond the words to the meaning and intent of the law,[[Page S2040]]even when his decisions lacked commonsense.  When we asked about decisions where Judge Gorsuch seemed to adopt strained interpretations that narrow laws meant to protect worker safety, he said simply that he was a judge and he didn't take sides. Yet too many times, his narrow interpretations led to decisions that were on the side of big corporations and against the side of the little guy. When asked to respond, he said that if we didn't like the result, if we didn't like his decisions, it was because a statute was too limited or unclear, and that Members of Congress should do better.  We asked Judge Gorsuch about his decision in Hobby Lobby, which found an expansive new right to religious liberty for a corporation that employed thousands of people. He did not explain how he assessed the terrible impact this decision had for thousands of working women at the company who would now be denied access to contraceptive coverage.  When I met with Judge Gorsuch, he told me he had a heart. After 4 days of hearings, I still don't know what is in his heart. I would have liked Judge Gorsuch to have been more open so we could have had a real conversation about what the law is and who the courts protect. What we got instead were platitudes about the work of the courts that came straight from a Norman Rockwell painting.  I did agree with the judge that article III courts are there to protect minority rights. Article III of the Constitution protects the independence of the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts and gives enormous authority to judges and Justices to determine how to apply the law to the cases before them to protect minority rights.  It is critical that before we decide to grant Judge Gorsuch a lifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court, the Senate is able to gain an understanding of his approach to the law. At our judiciary committee hearing, I asked Jeff Perkins, the father of a young boy with autism, about the impact of Judge Gorsuch's decision on his son's education progress at and outside of his new school. The case involved the protections of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, which Judge Gorsuch's decision narrowed to point that these comments under the law were deemed virtually meaningless.  The new school that Luke Perkins attended made little effort to ensure that the skills he developed in school were translating at home. As a result, Luke severely regressed. Experts in autism, psychology, and occupational therapy testified on Luke's behalf that the school was seriously neglecting his needs. An impartial hearing officer, an administrative law judge, and Federal district court all agreed Luke's regression showed that the school was not providing him with a ``free appropriate public education'' as required by the  Judge Gorsuch disagreed and decided the school had ``merely more than de minimis'' responsibility to do better for Jeff Perkins, Luke's father, said that he knew Judge Gorsuch's decision would negatively impact thousands of families with special needs children like It broke his heart.  Judge Gorsuch's extraordinarily narrow interpretation of the IDEA was rejected unanimously by the U.Supreme Court last week. In his opinion for the unanimous Court, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the minimal standard determined by Judge Gorsuch was clearly at odds with the purpose of the law for children who are not progressing along with their peers. Justice Roberts wrote:       The goals may differ, but every child should have the      chance to meet challenging objectives. . . . When all is said      and done, a student offered an educational program providing      ``merely more than de minimis'' progress from year to year      can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.  When asked by my colleague, Senator Durbin of Illinois, why the judge wanted to ``lower the bar so low'' in his decision, Judge Gorsuch, referring to Luke's case, responded:       If anyone is suggesting that I like a result where an      autistic child happens to lose, that's a heartbreaking      accusation to me. But the fact of the matter      is what is bound by certain precedent.  Heartbreaking or not, Judge Gorsuch still found against the autistic child. Thankfully, the Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Gorsuch's wrong decision. It was wrong because remedial legislation such as IDEA should be broadly interpreted in favor of the group being protected. And it was wrong because the courts are not innocent bystanders. Their decisions have real-world impacts for thousands or even millions of people beyond the parties in a particular case before the  This is especially true of the Supreme Court, which issues decisions that don't just reach those cases in front of them--the frozen trucker, women who work at Hobby Lobby faced with lack of critical healthcare. They also reach millions of others impacted by interpretations of the law made by the Court in those decisions. The Supreme Court does not just interpret our laws. The Supreme Court is an affirmation of our country's values. The Supreme Court shapes our society.  When we began the hearings on Judge Gorsuch's nomination, I said the Supreme Court vacancy isn't just another position we must fill in our Federal judiciary. A Supreme Court vacancy is a solemn obligation we must fulfill for the future of our country and for our future generations. The central question for me, in looking at Judge Gorsuch and his record and listening carefully through 3 days of hearings, is whether he would be a Justice for all or Justice for some. Regrettably, I do not believe Judge Gorsuch would be a Justice for all of us.  I will oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This vacancy is simply too important for the future of America and our values to do otherwise.  I yield back.

930,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to both of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, resolutions related to retirement that we will be considering this week. These CRA resolutions before us would kill Federal regulations that give cities and States the opportunity to expand retirement options for individuals.  Our Nation faces a retirement crisis. In Hawaii, about 50 percent of private sector workers have jobs that don't provide retirement benefits.  According to a recent survey by AARP Hawaii, 56 percent of working age people feel anxious about having enough money saved for retirement. For generations, Americans relied on the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement: Social Security, private savings, and a pension from their employer. Those days are gone. More and more seniors are relying on Social Security for a bigger share of their income in old age.  In Hawaii, the average monthly Social Security benefit is $1,408. Given the cost of housing, medical insurance, and other necessities in Hawaii, that is not nearly enough.  Seniors should be able to count on us to keep Social Security strong. That is a bedrock position we should honor.  Given the retirement crisis, taking away tools that States and local governments can use to help bolster retirement savings makes absolutely no sense, yet this is what we are about to do if we pass these CRA resolutions.  Last week, the Hawaii State Senate held a hearing on legislation that would establish a Hawaii retirement savings working group. The proposed legislation would bring together public and private stakeholders to look at ways to improve retirement savings for workers. A number of stakeholder groups, retirees, and other citizens testified on the bill.  Let me tell you one of their stories. His name is He is a 61-year-old gay man who has lost three husbands to HIV/Donald has worked for 35 years and even set aside money for retirement using 401(k)s--401(k)s that he cashed out to help cover medical costs for his loved ones.  He said: ``I did what I had to do out of love and devotion, especially when each of my guys' families took a step back in the face of adversity.''  Donald now lives paycheck to paycheck in senior affordable housing. He plans to work until he is at least 65.  Personal tragedy isn't the only reason it is difficult for him to save. He wants to save, but he noted that ``I am trying to muster some form of IRA through local financial institutions to no avail. No one returns the calls.''  For too many working people, saving for retirement isn't automatic or easy. It seems out of reach, but we can't let that stand.  The Obama administration recognized the retirement crisis in our country and the need for new thinking to help people save. In fact, that is the point of the regulations the Senate is poised to kill. These regulations simply provide a framework that States and cities can use to expand access to retirement savings.  There are no Big Government mandates or industry takeovers. States and cities would simply have the opportunity to be creative and help families save for retirement. The fact Republicans want to kill these rules has a certain ``Alice in Wonderland'' quality to it, where up is down and down is up.  For the last few weeks, Republicans touted how TrumpCare was giving States more flexibility to provide healthcare, while the reality was that for a State like Hawaii and many others, TrumpCare would have saddled them not with more flexibility but more costs. At that point, States' rights was one of the selling points for that disastrous legislation.  This week Republicans have taken a U-turn. Now they are trying to kill regulations that would actually give States more flexibility to provide retirement security. Why we should take[[Page S2066]]away this tool from States is beyond me. Cynics would say Republicans are doing this to help some private entities sell more retirement plans to people. However, the reality is that millions of families are not being served.  Killing these rules is the latest Republican attack on working people. We should be fighting to give people like Donald more hope and opportunity. Voting against these resolutions is a vote to help people like  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing what I can only characterize as lousy anti-working people resolutions.  I yield the floor.

1166,topic-id,922,"Mr.President, the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, resolution we are debating today is the latest attack in the unrelenting Republican crusade against funding--or defunding--Planned They have tried everything: passing stand-alone bills, attaching poison pills to must-pass bills, threatening a government shutdown, struggling and failing to pass  Today, we are debating whether to repeal an administrative action that protects abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, that receive title X funding. Just a little while ago, Vice President Pence was here to break a tie because Republicans in Congress couldn't get enough men to tell women what to do with their bodies.  For nearly 50 years, title X funding has helped low-income Americans access vital health services like birth control and cervical and breast cancer screenings. Title X funding has been a healthcare lifeline for millions of women in all parts of the country. But if this Congressional Review Act resolution is passed, Planned Parenthood clinics across our country can be prohibited from receiving title X funding, even though it is currently illegal to use Federal dollars to fund abortion services. Let me repeat: No Federal dollars can be used to fund abortion services, period.  I understand the strong anti-abortion belief held by some of my colleagues, but I don't understand why this translates into relentless attacks on an organization that uses no Federal funds for abortion. Planned Parenthood uses Federal funds to provide vital healthcare services to millions of people, mainly women. Yes, I acknowledge there are men who go to Planned Parenthood also.  In 2014, Planned Parenthood provided over 600,000 cancer screenings and over 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections. But this is a factual argument, and we have learned over the years that many of my Republican colleagues simply will not listen to facts when it comes to Planned  Let me share a few stories from my constituents about the transformational impact Planned Parenthood has had in their lives. Perhaps after hearing these stories, we will think twice about attacking the vital services Planned Parenthood provides all across our country.  Hawaii is home to a large military community. Taylor from Honolulu is a military spouse who wrote to me that she and other military dependents turn to Planned Parenthood because of long wait times and confidentiality concerns within the military healthcare system. Taylor wrote:       My friend was experiencing severe cramping and pelvic pain      to the point where she had to utilize a sick day. When she      visited the medical services provider through the military,      they scheduled her for an appointment for four days out. She      was sent home with no pelvic exam or ultrasound. The pain was      so severe that she went to Planned Parenthood because she      could not wait to see her primary care physician. They      immediately performed a pelvic exam, an ultrasound, and an      STD screening. She was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory      disease. Annually, 100,000 women become infertile as a result      of PID, so receiving quick treatment for this condition is      critical.  Taylor continued:       Defunding Planned Parenthood means that individuals who      experience common reproductive healthcare issues like this      would have lessened chances of receiving quick, necessary and      comprehensive medical care. Had it not been for Planned      Parenthood, she could have lost her ability to have children      in the future.  Do my Republican colleagues want to deprive military spouses of vital healthcare services?  I also heard from Tiffany, a student at the University of Hawaii, who went to a Planned Parenthood clinic after a pregnancy scare. She wrote:       I was afraid because I knew that having a child was beyond      my means. I was just starting out my university years at 21;      and I have extremely conservative parents who would have      surely not approved of my actions. I knew how difficult      having a child was for someone in my situation, especially      while going to school, and risking sacrificing my future, my      key to stepping out of poverty, was not an option. I was      unemployed and had Medicaid at the time as well, and Planned      Parenthood accommodated my financial situation.       Thankfully, I discovered I was not pregnant, and Planned      Parenthood took the extra time to sit me through my options      without any judgment whatsoever. I was also prescribed birth      control, offered an STD test, and was given Plan B in the      event I ever missed my birth control. The sense of relief,      reassurance, and care I felt walking out of the clinic left      me with a very strong impression, especially after so many      days of anxiety.  Do my Republican colleagues want to take away resources that help thousands of young women like Tiffany fulfill their full potential?  These stories aren't rhetoric. They aren't hyperbole. They aren't spin. They are powerful reminders that each day, women turn to Planned Parenthood in a time of need.[[Page S2125]]  Some of my colleagues have argued that all these thousands of women who go to Planned Parenthood clinics can go to community health centers if Planned Parenthood clinics have to close because of defunding.  This morning, I met with over a dozen leaders from Hawaii's community health centers. So I asked them, could you take in all of Planned Parenthood's patients? Their answer was an unequivocal no. Our communities cannot afford to lose Planned Parenthood clinics.  A vote for this CRA is a vote to deprive women like Taylor and Tiffany and millions more throughout our country of these important healthcare services. Let's stop these attacks on women's healthcare.

759,topic-id,1538,"Mr.Speaker, last week was an historic week in many respects.  My Republican colleagues have indicated, for 6 years, they wanted to repeal the Affordable Care They introduced a bill which really did not accomplish that objective, but it did undermine, very severely, the protections and the opportunities that the Affordable Care Act provided our citizens. That bill did not come to a vote. Had it come to a vote, it would have lost very substantially.  Mr.Speaker, the proclamations last week by Republican leaders are that the Affordable Care Act will now remain in place. As Paul Ryan, our Speaker, said on Friday: ``ObamaCare is the law of the land.''                              {time}  1015  The Affordable Care Act is, indeed, the law of the land. Mr.Speaker, I rise, however, in a deep concern that the Trump administration and its allies in Congress will take steps to undermine the law and weaken it, to the detriment of millions who will see their health care put at risk. In other words, in my view, they may well try to do indirectly what they could not do directly.  Let it be absolutely clear: Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House of As a result, they are the governing party and will be responsible for anything that happens to our healthcare system on their watch.  Even without the passage of a repeal bill, the Trump administration's actions could fundamentally undermine the law and the stability of our healthcare system.  First and foremost, the Trump administration must commit to continuing payments for cost-sharing subsidies. We met with insurance companies yesterday to see whether or not the environment that was being created by the administration was undermining confidence so that it would undermine the ability to price the product that Americans need: healthcare insurance.  Cost-sharing payments, paid for and in the bill, are being put at risk by a suit that the Republicans in the House of Representatives have filed. They ought to withdraw that suit to give confidence to the system. We all know that confidence in markets is critically important. This is essential to preserving the affordability and accessibility of health care for millions of Americans and to ensuring stability in health insurance markets.  The uncertainty around cost-sharing subsidies that has been perpetrated by the administration's silence on this issue, must come to an end. The administration has said the system will implode. It will only implode if they are forced to do so by the administration through executive action. Insurers are preparing to file rates as soon as next month in some Without a clear and public commitment from the administration, we could very well see premiums spike and insurers flee.  Americans have made their opinion pretty clear. They said: Do not do that. Do not undermine the system.  Second, already, President Trump has undermined that requirement through lax enforcement that the individual responsibility requirement--a Republican suggestion, a Heritage Foundation suggestion, a Romney-adopted policy in the State of Massachusetts--a premise of personal responsibility that is being undermined right now by the Trump administration. The individual responsibility requirement is vital to ensuring that those with preexisting conditions can be guaranteed coverage.  To my friends across the aisle who talk often about defending our Constitution, I would remind them that the President has sworn an oath to faithfully execute the laws of this Nation; not picking and choosing which ones he likes.  Third, the administration can--and I would suggest it should--encourage States that have not yet accepted expanded Medicaid to do so. It works. According to a 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, in the expanded-Medicaid States, premiums were 7 percent lower on average.  Mr.Speaker, just yesterday, the Republican-controlled Kansas State legislature--Republican Governor, Republican House, Republican Senate--sent a bill to the Governor that would expand the State's Medicaid program. Presumably, they made a judgment that was in the best interest of their State and the best interest of their people.  The Republican sponsor of the bill, State Senator Vicki Schmidt said: ``I don't believe we can wait for D.They had an opportunity, and they didn't take it.''  So her response was, and the legislature's response has been: adopt Medicaid expansion.  We have heard a lot from Governors of both parties from States with expanded Medicaid, almost universally extolling the benefits that they provided, and urging Congress not to roll it back.  The Trump administration must recognize the importance of Medicaid expansion and support ongoing efforts in States like Kansas, Virginia, and Maine to do what is right for their people and their  Fourth, the Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Price, has a responsibility, a duty, an obligation to focus at least as much on outreach and enrollment, as did his predecessor, Secretary Burwell, to let people know what options they have, what opportunities they have, what protections they have, what securities they can achieve.  Earlier this year, the Trump administration, instead, intentionally sabotaged enrollment efforts in the final week, pulling media ads to let people know what they could sign up for, and ending other outreach programs.  This move resulted in half a million fewer people obtaining affordable coverage through the marketplaces--the first decline in the history of the law. Those people will be hurt because some of them are going to get sick. Some of them may have a catastrophic accident, and they will need insurance, and they will not have it because they did not get the information that they needed.  Now that the Affordable Care Act will continue to be the ``law of the land,'' to use words first spoken by former Speaker Boehner in 2012, the issue in 2012 was the Affordable Care Act--President Obama's probably crowning achievement. Republicans called it ObamaCare, derisively. We call it the Affordable Care Act, supported by President  After the 2012 election, Speaker Boehner said, well, we resolved that issue. The American people have voted to confirm a President whose principal law that was. But the Republicans kept trying to undermine it. They kept trying to say they wanted to repeal it. And now they have all of the power. They haven't done that.  Don't break it. If you couldn't do directly something, don't do it indirectly. Don't undermine the security of the American people indirectly; not through law.  So when open enrollment comes later this year, Mr.Speaker, it would be a dereliction of duty--let me repeat that: it would be a dereliction of duty--not to inform Americans to know how they can benefit under the law, what options they have for finding coverage at more affordable rates or through expanded Let there not be a dereliction of duty.  The larger point here, Mr.Speaker, is, as I have said, that Republicans cannot now simply throw up their hands and say: We failed to offer a viable alternative, and we will now, by action and inaction, by negligence and malfeasance, conspire to undermine the options that are available to the American people.  More than two-thirds of Americans have said that is not a responsible policy. The Affordable Care Act has brought protections and benefits to millions. Twenty million more people are insured in But now my Republican friends, who have no workable alternative, are in power; and it is[[Page H2522]]now their duty to ensure that they faithfully execute existing laws to benefit the American people. If they fail to do so, or intentionally sabotage the current healthcare system, they will surely be held accountable by the American people.  Democrats don't want to see that happen. We reject the premise of some kind of death spiral. By the way, the Congressional Budget Office--an independent bipartisan group, but its director appointed by Republicans--said it was not only not on a death spiral, but it was stable.  The yardstick by which we all ought to be judged is not whether the law succeeds just enough, but whether we can work together--work together, work together--to make the law work as best it can, to benefit as many Americans as it can.  President Trump, speaking at that rostrum, looked directly into the TV camera of 100 million-plus Americans and said: I want every American to have health insurance that will be cheaper and higher quality than we have today.  Mr.President, if you send such a bill to this House, I will vote for it. I haven't seen a bill like that, but if I see it, and if you send it down here, and that is your commitment, I will vote for it.  Mr.Speaker, I hope my friends across the aisle will take a lesson from last week that, to paraphrase the President, health insurance is indeed complicated, and that it will truly take both parties working together towards consensus to meet the healthcare challenges we face.  Our constituents and our country is counting on us not to fight, not to throw bricks at one another, but to act in their best interest. And what I urge the Trump administration to do, Mr.Speaker: Do no harm until you have a bill that accomplishes what you said to the American people you want to accomplish. Mr.President, do no harm. Ensure that the American people continue to have access to affordable, quality health care.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2521.txt,566,MORNING BUSINESS,2017.0,29.0,March

Next, H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, sponsored by Chief Deputy Whip Patrick This bill will increase access to capital for America's small businesses and startups and ensure our entrepreneurs have the best chance to succeed. Mr.McHenry's bill is also a key component of our Innovation Initiative in the House, which aims to accelerate private sector innovation and leverage more innovation in government.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding again.  I was encouraged by the bipartisan agreements we reached on the MILCON/VA bill and the defense appropriations bill. As you know, together, these two bills make up roughly one half of our total discretionary spending.  However, I was disappointed to hear that Democrats have apparently walked away from the negotiating table on further bipartisan agreements like these. Personally, I was disappointed to hear rumors that Democrats are hoping for a government shutdown.  The New York Times is reporting that, ``as a minority party struggling to show resistance in the era of President Trump''--Democrats--``are now ready to let the lights of government go dark.''  I sincerely hope these rumors and reports are not true. I know the gentleman disagrees with ever having a government shutdown.

I want everybody to know that my door is always open, especially to you, my friend from Maryland, and any other House[[Page H2577]]colleague who wants to play a constructive role in the process.

1055,topic-id,497,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information and comments.  Frankly, I want to tell the majority leader, honestly, nobody on my side, maybe someplace else, but nobody on my side is wanting to shut down the government. We don't want to shut down the government.  Of course, I will remind my friend, the majority leader--and I appreciate his comments about our cooperation and ability to work together--the only way the government has been kept open over the last 5 years has been with Democratic votes. My friend didn't have 218 votes on his side of the aisle that would do that. So I think that belies the fact that we want to shut down the government.  I would assure my friend that that is neither our intent or desire. As a matter of fact, we want to work quickly to avoid that happening. That is not good for, obviously, the American people, it is not good for managers trying to plan on how to deliver services, and it is certainly not good for our Federal employees. So I would want to work with you to make sure that doesn't happen.  As we have in the past, we will be prepared to provide votes, as we have every time, to ensure that that does not happen.  Let me ask my friend, as we work towards the end of not shutting down government and passing, hopefully, an omnibus which will complete the 2017 appropriations process and fund the government through September 30, let me ask him--he was quoting some information. I have a quote for him as well. I know he would be disappointed if I didn't have a quote. This is not nearly as difficult as some of the others, however. It says:       House Republicans are considering making another run next      week at the passing of the healthcare bill that they abruptly      pulled from the floor in a setback to their efforts to repeal      Two Republican lawyers say the leaders are      discussing holding a vote, even staying into next weekend, if      necessary, but it is unclear what changes would be made to      the GOP's healthcare bill . . .  That was in Bloomberg News on March 29.  Does the majority leader have any information or expectation that we would be considering another bill seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act next week? I know the majority leader didn't announce that for next week, and I know on Thursday we will break for the Easter break.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman does know, from the widespread disagreement, that ObamaCare is failing. He disagrees with that, but the majority of Americans agree that it is collapsing and that we have to solve this problem.  As of today, I do not have anything scheduled for next week.

872,topic-id,2490,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr.Raskin of Maryland, for his incredible leadership and for the opportunity to continue to lead the Special Order hour for the Progressive Caucus here every week. And every week we do try to pick a different topic.  For those of you in the audience, we pick a different topic, and this evening that topic is the ties to Russia of this administration.  Yesterday, Sean Spicer told veteran White House correspondent April Ryan that she was ``going to have to take `no' for an answer'' when she asked him about the President's collusion with  Well, Mr.Spicer, we are here to tell you that we will not just take ``no'' for an answer. We are not going to sit back and believe everything that is coming out from the White House when there is mounting evidence that President Trump's campaign may have colluded with Russia to tip the election in his favor.  And for those of you who saw the Judiciary Committee today, we had a resolution of inquiry from Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Ted Lieu about this very issue in relation to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his ties to  Let's not forget that President Trump's former national security adviser and campaign adviser only lasted a record-setting 24 days in the role because he blatantly lied about meeting with Russia's Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign.  So what other ties to Russia have been confirmed?  There are so many of these ties that I thought it might be helpful to have a diagram and to really show exactly what the connections have been between top Trump officials during the campaign who are now the same officials that are serving in the White House and are the President's close and personal confidants. The fact that a diagram is even necessary tells us something.  Let's start at the top with the President himself.  President Trump has a long history with His first trip to Moscow was actually 30 years ago. He went to explore potential real estate opportunities. His relationship with the country has clearly grown.  In the late 1990s, Trump started banking with Deutsche Bank, which has since been investigated for funneling Russian money offshore.  Soon after that, he linked up with a Russian company called the Bayrock Group, which has ties to the Mafia and to criminal interests in Their partnership was integral to helping to[[Page H2553]]expand The Trump Organization to new heights, with properties springing up across the country.  His ties to Russia only grew deeper. In the late 2000s, several Russian businessmen bought properties from The Trump Organization, netting them hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.  Now, let's fast-forward to 2016 when then-candidate Trump was building his team. He brought on Carter Page, who is now under investigation for communicating with Russian officials. And, in fact, it was the Trump campaign's former manager, Corey Lewandowski, who gave Carter Page the green light to visit Moscow just last A couple of weeks later, Mr.Page met with Sergey Kislyak, but he said that he will not reveal the details of that conversation to the public.  This is a very important, consistent fact that we see. Our resolution of inquiry today that we debated in the Judiciary Committee was about the release of information so that we understand what is going on. Without any accusations, what we are trying to say is let us investigate what these ties are, what the conversations were, and let us determine, in an independent, bipartisan way, let us determine that there has not been collusion, and let us make sure that there is no foreign government that is affecting our democracy.  So various members of Trump's team met with Russian officials during the campaign. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions didn't just meet with officials, he lied about meeting with officials during his confirmation hearing.  And again, the top prosecutor in the United States of America lied under oath during a confirmation hearing. This cannot be ignored.  Once again, we are not saying don't have conversations, but don't lie about them. Don't make us wonder what happened during those conversations. How do we trust the Attorney General of the United States of America to fairly and impartially preside if he has shown that he is willing to make false statements just to get the job?  He is not the only high-level Trump official who has been blatantly dishonest with the American people. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, was put in place by President Trump and resigned due to the shady backdoor dealings that put him in the pocket of Russian officials. He was paid $45,000 to attend a state-sponsored gala dinner and sit at the table of Vladimir  These connections are more than just mere coincidence.  And in addition to Flynn, Page, and Sessions, there are several others who have been implicated: Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; former campaign adviser, Roger Stone; his personal lawyer--all of these folks are up here--his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are all under investigation for their connections to And now President Trump's son-in-law, who has become one of his top advisers, is under investigation as well for his actions during the campaign.  Not only did Jared Kushner meet with Ambassador Kislyak, he met with the Russian bankers as well. And the White House has claimed that the meetings were ``diplomatic,'' but it is deeply troubling that one of the bankers that he met with was Sergey  I want to be clear about who this person is. He is a graduate of the Russian Academy of the Federal Security Service, which is an academy that is tasked with training individuals to become members of Russia's security and intelligence forces. He is now the chairman of the Vnesheconombank, and he was appointed by Putin, himself. This is not a mom-and-pop bank. This is a state-owned corporation that has been under sanctions by the United States for the past 3 years. And that is a big deal.  Jared Kushner, whose family is worth nearly $2 billion, has real estate interests around the world, sat down, allegedly under the auspices of his role with the President, to chat with this owner of the bank. A spokesperson for the Kremlin has alleged that this meeting was ``absolutely the bank's prerogative'' and that the Russian Government was unaware of the meeting.  We need more information to know what happened in that meeting because, otherwise, where there is smoke, we think there is fire. So we need to have the information so that we can actually determine what is happening with these connections because, if somebody from the Trump campaign and the Trump administration is meeting with Russian officials and they don't want to tell us why or what is discussed, then we have to start wondering whether the conversations are in the interest of the American people or in the interest of the Russian  We also have Rex Tillerson, President Trump's Secretary of State, who has strong business ties to Russia and was awarded the Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin in 2013. This is the highest honor that Russia can bestow on noncitizens. Just 2 years prior, Tillerson had struck a massive $500 billion oil deal with the Russian  Now, we could go on and on with this, but what is important for the American people to understand is that we have expectations that the President of the United States and that his Cabinet are working in the interests of the American people.  We have expectations that, if a deal is struck, it is not for the benefit of some other country or for the personal benefit of any individual in office, but that it is for the public's benefit. And if a deal is struck that takes benefit away from the public in order to give it to a foreign government or to an individual personal interest of our government, then that is an enormous disservice to our democracy, and, of course, there are constitutional ramifications for all of this.  This administration has tried to tell us that the conversations between Trump's advisers and high-level Russian businessmen and officials were about diplomacy. Yet this shroud of secrecy that continues every time we try to get information, every time we try to make sure that there is an independent, bipartisan investigation, the shroud of secrecy continues, and it begs the question: If this is really about advocating for the interests of the American people and not the Russian Government or the pocketbooks of Cabinet members, then why the secrecy? What is there to hide?  We don't understand that. If there is nothing to hide, then let us have the information. There have been plenty of requests to do that in a classified way in case there is some information that is classified.  But why are the President's campaign advisers and officials denying under oath that they have communicated with Russia only then to be forced to walk back their statements or recuse themselves, as Jeff Sessions had to do, or to even resign?  Foreign policy is key to American interests, but these backroom conversations and subsequent lies are doing nothing to make the American people feel confident in an administration that is supposed to represent them. It is clear that there is a strong tie here that was only strengthened during the campaign.  But let's be very clear about what is the connective tissue in all of this, in all of these lines that go back and forth. What is the connective tissue that connects all of this? It is money.  How did we get to this point?  Of course, we remember the hacking of the election that occurred last year. It is in the process of being investigated, even though the chairman of the Intelligence Committee feels that his first duty is to the President and not to the members of the committee.  But last year, President Trump defended Vladimir Putin by placing the blame on the Democratic National Committee to distract the American people; and then, in July, he outright urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails, saying: ``Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.''  In December, a CIA assessment concluded that Russia was trying to help then-candidate Trump win the election. Why? Because they know that they have an ally in President They have someone who is willing to do business with them, even if it may not be in the best interests of the American people. They know that they are well connected at every level of his administration.  And let's be clear about who we are talking about with Mr.This is a[[Page H2554]]dictator, a human rights abuser, somebody whom Republicans and Democrats, alike, have said we cannot be associated with.                              {time}  1745  You have heard of ``The Manchurian Candidate.'' In the most recent election, we may have ended up with the Kremlin candidate, and the script truly writes itself.  We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this, as I said. We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this in a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee, but we never got the chance.  Last Tuesday, Representative Nunes went to the secret briefing in a National Security Council facility, and what he found apparently wasn't good for the President because he ran over there to tell the Instead of doing his duty and reporting the information to the House Intelligence Committee, he went straight to the White House with his findings. And he is supposed to be chairing an investigation into what happened, not being the runner for information to the  After briefing President Trump, Representative Nunes canceled the hearing, denying Americans the opportunity to hear from former Acting Attorney General Sally And Ranking Member Jim Himes was right when he said that ``the Monday hearing last week was, I'm sure, not to the White House's liking.''  He went on to say: ``Since Monday, I'm sorry to say, the chairman,'' Chairman Nunes, ``has ceased to be the chairman of an investigative committee and has been running interference for the Trump White House.''  This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that we are questioning whether or not several members of the President's Cabinet--not just one, not even just two, but several members of the President's Cabinet, including the President, himself--are guilty of collusion with a foreign government is a downright outrage.  In my home district, the Seventh District of Washington State, I have been receiving numerous calls, hundreds of calls from constituents since day one, saying: How can this be happening in this democracy? How is this possible in America? How do we make sure that our government is representing us and not a foreign entity?  Why is it that somebody would lie about whether or not they had a conversation with the Russian Government if there was nothing to hide?  People are losing faith in the United States It is a crisis of democracy when people can't trust that their government is actually trying to get to the bottom of what is going on and actually representing the interests of the American people.  The White House may have a friend in Representative Nunes, but I want the American people to know that they have a friend in us. We won't back down on our demands. Representative Nunes should recuse himself from this investigation. There is no way we can expect a full and impartial investigation after what has just occurred.  This should not be a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, should be demanding to know the facts. We are not making judgments. We want to know the facts. If there are facts that we don't know that say, no, there were very legitimate conversations, there was no collusion, then we are done. Why tie up the airwaves with this?  So tonight, as we think about where we are in this debate and we think about the fact that, for 3 months, this administration has been under the shadow of secrecy, under the shadow of mistrust from the American people, there is a very easy way to clear all of the names of the people who are on this list, including the President of the United States, and that is to ensure that we have an independent investigation; to ensure that Representative Nunes recuses himself and steps down as the chair of the Intelligence Committee, given what has happened; and to ensure that, at the end of the day, we remember that the Government of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the Congress of the United States of America, our one duty is to represent the people of the United States of  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin) for his leadership.

As a result, NATO remains as relevant today as it was in the year of its founding.  As Defense Secretary GEN James Mattis stated in his January confirmation hearing, ``If we did not have NATO today, we would need to create it.''

Because of that commitment, Montenegro's membership in NATO will enhance stability in  Finally, Russia's alleged support of an attempted coup in Montenegro must not be rewarded by NATO turning its back on a country that exhibits such courage in resisting Russia's persistent aggression.

Expanding NATO to include nations that desire to join the alliance and commit to meeting membership requirements contributes to a strong and stable It wasn't all that long ago that the Balkans region was unstable and war-torn, but because Slovenia, Croatia, and Albania have joined NATO, the Balkans is a far more stable region.

734,topic-id,508,"Mr.President, a skilled workforce is essential to addressing the growing cybersecurity challenges in the United In both the public and private sectors, a shortage of skilled cyber security professionals has hindered the Nation's cyber preparedness. According to a 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, 1.8 million more cyber security professionals will be needed worldwide by 2022.  Data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management in 2015 highlighted the need for robust cyber security protections at the Federal level, which include a strong and skilled workforce. Since 2001, the Federal Government has operated a cyber security education program known as CyberCorps: Scholarship for Thanks to great leadership by Chairman John Thune and the U.Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Congress codified the CyberCorps Program as part of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. Serving roughly 70 institutions, the National Science Foundation, NSF, grants award to institutions as part of the CyberCorps Institutions utilize grants to build capacity for cyber security programs and provide scholarships to students. Scholarship recipients must fulfill a service requirement in a federal, state or local government cyber security job upon graduation.  In recent years, more community colleges have provided opportunities for students to gain much needed cyber security skills. An October 2015 study by the National Academy for Public Administration reviewed the CyberCorps Program and formulated major recommendations to improve it. One of the Academy's recommendations was to include qualified 2-year programs in the program regardless of their association with a 4-year institution. Currently, NSF only provides scholarship awards to students in 2-year programs who will transfer into a 4-year program.  Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Roger Wicker, the Cybersecurity Scholarship Opportunities Act of 2017. This legislation will improve the federal cyber security workforce pipeline by directing the CyberCorps Program to provide 5 percent of scholarships to career changers and military veterans at qualified 2-year programs with no transfer requirement. The bill would also codify CyberCorps' K-12 education program and align the skills required for scholarship eligibility with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  In addition, the bill would enhance cyber security protection for critical infrastructure by allowing CyberCorps graduates, on a case-by-case basis, to meet their service requirements in critical infrastructure missions at government-affiliated entities like the Tennessee Valley Just today, a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that digital threats to U.critical infrastructure demand attention and that the Nation does not produce enough graduates with the skills to protect critical infrastructure. It recommended that the President take steps to increase the supply of skilled professionals. By allowing CyberCorps graduates to fulfill service obligations in critical infrastructure missions, this legislation represents an important step in the right direction.  The Cybersecurity Scholarship Opportunities Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help students succeed and strengthen our national security. There are cyber security jobs in Virginia and across the country that are going unfilled, and it is clear we must make it easier for students to access the programs that prepare them for these roles.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2049.txt,2176,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,28.0,March

In hearing my friends on the other side of the aisle describe their efforts to improve health care, I just wonder if we have the right bill on the floor. Because looking at all the external analysis--the CBO, which I know you want to discount, but there are many other organizations--what do they say about this legislation?  It is a terrible bill. It increases costs that Americans will bear. Despite the fact that we hear about decreasing premiums, all the reports say that this will increase premiums and increase out-of-pocket costs that Americans will have to put out in order to protect themselves from disease.  It will provide less coverage. Twenty-four million Americans will lose coverage. But even for those who might be able to have health insurance without essential benefits assured, that will just be a health insurance card, but not access to an emergency room, not access to maternal care, not access to prescription drugs, not access to hospitalization. Basically you will be able to get diagnosed, but you won't get health care.       This is a terrible bill. We ought to reject it today.

1191,topic-id,562,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking about the harmful effects of this resolution of disapproval.  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his words and for the very important point that we are seeing the lowest number of teen pregnancies that we have seen for a long, long time. Why would you want to mess with something that is finally reducing the number of teen pregnancies?  I thank Senator Murray, who has been here diligently leading in this effort, because rolling this rule back will result in something very simple: It will result in less access to care for women and families.  Title X funding supports vital family planning and related preventive care for low-income, uninsured, and young people across this country. Every year, more than 4 million people, including many who are living in rural and medically underserved areas, go to the over 4,000 health centers that rely on this funding. This includes 41 service sites in Minnesota that provide access to cancer screenings, birth control, and testing for sexually transmitted infections. In fact, 40 percent of women who receive care at title X clinics consider it to be their only source of healthcare--40 percent--which is incredibly important in rural areas.  One thinks of, just recently, in the last few years, the Zika scare. People wanted to go and get birth control. They wanted to know what they could do to prevent themselves from getting Zika in order to save the lives of their babies. This is true, and this is what will be happening if they make these cuts.  The regulation we are voting on today should be common sense. It simply makes clear that funds will be awarded solely based on a provider's ability to serve a patient, and it guarantees that women have access to the care they are entitled to under Federal law.  We should be strengthening our efforts to provide better and more affordable care that best serves patients. Instead, repealing this rule will take essential services away from women when they need them most. By overriding this regulation, States will now pick and choose who provides these services, which will be based on arbitrary criteria that has nothing to do with the quality of services patients will receive. That should be our benchmark--the quality of services.  When States have done this in the past, it has blocked access to critical family planning and healthcare services for many women, including those in rural areas who rely on the health centers that need these funds.  As Senator Murray said this morning, women across the country have made it clear that restricting women's access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable.  We have a situation in which this existing rule has yielded the lowest number of teen pregnancies in years. We have a situation in which two of our Republican colleagues have joined us in opposition to this repeal. We have a situation in which the Vice President of the United States had to come in and break a tie.  Do you know what I would say?

The rule adds costly and unnecessary innovation-stifling regulations to the internet and is another example of the Federal Government's picking winners and losers.

It is an incredibly important role of the Senate for advice and consent. We are talking about a Supreme Court Justice as someone who serves on the Court for life, so it has to be right.  A long conversation about Neil Gorsuch is coming to a head. In the next week, he will come to this floor. He will face final debate, and the very long confirmation process will end with him joining the Supreme Court as the ninth When he is added on as an Associate Justice, it won't have been a short journey. He has met with every single Senator face to face. He has made all the time available that they wanted to have for face-to-face questions and to be able to go through those issues personally. He has been in very long hearings. He sat down hour after hour, multiple days, answering questions from Senators in the Judiciary Committee, then a vote from the Judiciary Committee, and then coming to this floor. There has been research in his background in every case. Everything he has ever written and every speech he has ever given has been examined overwhelmingly. And at the end of that, he has been found to be a very serious member of the judiciary.  In this body in 2006, he was put on the Tenth Circuit, a circuit that Oklahoma happens to be in. There was a unanimous vote in the Senate in 2006 for him to join the Tenth He was seen as a consistent, solid, mainstream, fair judge. That means Senator Joe Biden voted for him. Hillary Clinton voted for him. Chuck Schumer voted for him. Barack Obama voted for him in 2006.  After going through all of his background leading up to this point, since that time, what has happened? Did he leave the mainstream during that time period after he was overwhelmingly voted here, unanimously out of the Senate, to be on the Tenth Circuit? Well, since that time, he has been a part of 2,700 cases in the last decade. Of those 2,700 cases, 97 percent of them were unanimous. In 99 percent of the cases, he was in the majority in those opinions. Only 1 percent of the time he was not in the majority of the decision.  So you may ask, who is the Tenth Circuit Court that he is working with, this large group of judges who are in that court? Let me give you the basics of it. Of the Tenth Circuit judges there right now, whom he is serving with, with whom he was in the majority 99 percent of the time, five of the other judges were Obama appointees, five of them were George Bush appointees, three of them were Clinton appointees, three of them were Reagan appointees, 1 was Bush 41, and 2 of them were from President That is the group he was voting with in the majority 99 percent of the time.  He was seen by this Senate in 2006 to be a solid, mainstream jurist. Since that time period, he has voted with them 99 percent of the time in a very diverse Tenth  CRS, in their background research with him, said that Judge Gorsuch's opinions had the fewest number of dissents of anyone in the Tenth In other words, when he wrote the opinion, his colleagues disagreed with him the fewest number of times of anyone on the Tenth  He is a solid jurist, respected around the country, and one who deserves not only an intense investigation but I believe deserves to be put on the Supreme Court of the United I look forward to voting for him next week.

Clarence Thomas, one of the most controversial nominees in this last century, came out of the committee with a divided committee. After the vote failed, the committee then voted to send his nomination to the floor without a recommendation. He then passed on a floor vote of 52 to 48. There was never a request for a cloture vote. No one filibustered him--not one person.  If Clarence Thomas would have had a filibuster threat facing him, he wouldn't be on the Court today. He has been an excellent jurist on the Supreme Court, but he came out during a time when there weren't these idle threats.  It is even interesting that Robert Bork, who is currently not on the Court--his vote failed 42 to 58, but that was a failed final vote. Robert Bork did[[Page S2081]]not face a filibuster threat. He was brought to a final up-or-down vote.  I could go on and on to walk through the judges and Justices and how they have gone through the process, but there has been a simple procedure: Is this person qualified?  The American Bar Association, multiple entities, huge bipartisan support around the country--there is no question he is qualified. There is no question he has been a great jurist. There is no question he has been an excellent writer.  Now it is a question of, Will the Senate follow through on the procedures that we have followed through on for two centuries?

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and want to address an issue created by the Federal Communication Commission's misguided privacy rule in a recent Ninth Circuit case.  For decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been the privacy cop on the beat for most industries, including the technology sector, protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Federal Trade Commission has brought over 500 privacy and data security cases to protect consumers. These include cases against internet service providers and some of the largest edge providers.  The Federal Communications Commission is a regulatory body focused on regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.  The Federal Trade Commission's work in privacy and data security has long been held up as a model by both parties, praising the agency for strong enforcement without overly burdensome regulations. During negotiations with the European Union to finalize the U.S.-European privacy shield, the Obama administration held up the Federal Trade Commission as the premier privacy enforcement agency.  Unfortunately, in a midnight action, the Federal Communications Commission jammed through its own privacy rule that is very different from the framework that the Federal Trade Commission has been enforcing for decades.  While we can reverse the poorly constructed FCC rule today, we must still address a recent court ruling. The Ninth Circuit recently ruled that the common carrier exemption in the Federal Trade Commission Act exempts an entity in its entirety from the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction if it engages in any common carrier activities, even if the company also engages in non-common carrier activity.  I have introduced legislation to address the court's ruling with the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Olson). It is my hope that our colleagues will join us.  S.34 makes clear that the Federal Trade Commission has authority over common carriers when they are acting outside the scope of the common carrier.  The repeal of the Federal Communications Commission's misguided privacy rule in the Ninth Circuit's opinion creates a gap and an irrational approach to privacy for consumers and would leave portions of the internet ecosystem completely outside the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction.

As the longest serving president in its history, David has led Castleton through an extraordinary transformation. David leaves Castleton as a vibrant, economic engine of the Green Mountain State and a trailblazer in inclusivity, entrepreneurship, and service learning.  Castleton students have often found a unique kinship with David, noting his frequency in the student dining halls and at student club events. As an avid fan of Castleton Spartan Athletics, David is proud of the accomplishments of the school's student-athletes. The university more than doubled its varsity sport offerings during David's tenure, enabling Vermont students to play Division III sports. The largest community investment was the development of the Spartan Arena, which is used by both the school and the community as an all-purpose community center and athletic space.  As a Rutland native, David has always felt a special connection to his hometown. As president, his focus on integrating Castleton and the surrounding community has built a lasting alliance that promises regional prosperity for years to come. Most recently, Castleton has partnered with the Rutland Economic Development Corporation to open the Castleton Downtown Office, a publicly accessible space for students and community members alike. A nexus of the downtown, this space now hosts the Center for Entrepreneurial Programs, Center for Schools, Center for Community Engagement, and the Castleton Polling David's passion for the arts has also inspired a coupling of the Castleton Downtown Art Gallery and the historic Paramount  As the needs of our students, families, and communities continue to evolve, David's legacy is his success in elevating education as a key solution to addressing our most pressing public challenges. As he transitions to his next venture, I wish David and his wife, Lyn, great success and hope they will find joy in visiting family and friends found throughout the world.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement issued by Castleton University be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From Castleton University]   President Wolk Announces 16th Year Will Be His Final at Castleton    Longest serving president in university history to step down in                                 December       Castleton University President Dave Wolk announced at a      campus assembly Wednesday that he will step down in December      after serving for 16 years as president. Wolk came to the      presidency in December of 2001 after intertwined careers in      education and government, and 2017 marks his 43rd year in      public service. Wolk is the longest serving president in      Castleton history by more than four years.       ``I have been blessed, more than I deserve, to have had so      many leadership opportunities over the last 43 years, and I      am especially grateful for the last 16 at Moving      on at the end of 2017 will indeed be emotionally challenging      because I absolutely love our students and staff, I am lucky      to be part of this exceptional community, and I bleed green,      full of Spartan I will be a Spartan always and      forever.''       Beginning in 2018, Wolk will begin a new startup venture,      Wolk Leadership Solutions, with his wife, The Wolks will      work with CEOs and Boards of Directors in business,      government, industry, schools, hospitals, universities and an      array of nonprofits to find solutions to leadership      challenges. The new entrepreneurial venture will specialize      in coaching leaders to achieve greater success, while      offering mediation and conflict resolution services.       ``Our goal will be to help leaders to be more successful.      We will help boards and leaders to find solutions to their      challenges, and to do so in a way that will be effective and      enduring over time through coaching and guiding change. I am      also hoping to do some teaching and writing, including      involvement in a Vermont leadership institute. Helping people      to be better at what they do has always been a passion.''       At his inauguration in the fall of 2002, Wolk addressed a      standing room only crowd[[Page S2043]]     and promised that together the Castleton community would take      action, and make history. He promised that together they      would attract high quality students, invest in their      education and in their experiences, improve their campus, and      support each other for the benefit of       During Wolk's tenure the university invested nearly $100      million in infrastructure improvements, expanded academic      offerings at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and      expanded co-curricular activities, which has transformed what      was once considered a ``suitcase campus'' into a model for      vibrancy and engagement across the state and region.       ``Castleton has never been in better shape, thanks to      President Wolk's visionary and passionate leadership,'' said      VSC Chancellor Jeb ``People who visit the campus      for the first time in a while are amazed at the      transformation that has taken place during his tenure. It      will be impossible to replace Dave and we will miss him      greatly, but he will leave Castleton with a very strong      foundation for success into the future.''       Since 2001 Castleton has increased its enrollment by more      than 75 percent, more than doubled its athletic offerings,      built or renovated every building on campus, and expanded      into nearby Rutland to offer students better connections with      area businesses, schools, hospitals, and non-profits in an      effort to enhance the Castleton student experience. Recently,      the university has taken over operations of the Rutland      Economic Development Corporation, a partnership unlike any      other in the country, which has deepened the university's      commitment to being an economic and intellectual driver in      the community while creating strong outcomes for its      students.       In 2009 Wolk ushered in the Castleton Student Initiative, a      $25.7 million project which reinvigorated student life and      learning and changed the face of campus. The largest      investment in the history of Castleton, and the Vermont State      Colleges, it included improvements and additions to nearly      every aspect of student life including athletics, the campus      center, and the arts. The crown jewel of the project, Spartan      Stadium, is one of the finest multi-use facilities in New      England and has been central to the growth of Castleton's      athletic programs, as well as providing a venue to grow      Castleton's reach throughout the state and beyond.       Currently nearing the midpoint of the university's second      ten-year plan, the Castleton Plan, Wolk has most recently      overseen additions in graduate education, enrollment      increases, a greater presence in Rutland, and a focus on      increasing international recruitment. All of these changes      culminated in what proved to be one of the most historic days      in the institution's storied 230 year history when on July      23, 2015 the VSC Board of Trustees unanimously voted to      modernize the name to ``Castleton University.'' At the time,      Wolk said the name was both aspirational and inspirational,      as the community set forth to achieve the goals of the      Castleton       ``Dave's leadership, not just at Castleton but also among      the VSC Council of Presidents and Board of Trustees, will be      greatly missed,'' said VSC Board Chair Martha O'``He      leads with his heart, cares deeply about the state and its      students, and has positioned Castleton well for far reaching      success now and in the future which will benefit our state      for years to come. The board, and I personally, cannot thank      him enough for his private candor, public support, and      meaningful friendship.''       Wolk was born and grew up in He graduated from      Rutland High School and then Middlebury College with a degree      in political science. He earned a master's degree in      educational administration and planning at UVM and a      certificate of advanced graduate study at Harvard      During his professional career he has served as a school      principal, superintendent, Vermont's Commissioner of      Education, Vermont State Senator, and on more than 40 boards      and commissions, chairing several of them. He plans to      continue his life of public service in a variety of ways      going forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2042.txt,1383,DISASTER SIMPLIFIED ASSISTANCE VALUE ENHANCEMENT ACT,2017.0,28.0,March
719,topic-id,1536,"Mr.President, as in so many rural States, small businesses make up the backbone of Vermont's economy and communities. Countless Vermont businesses develop and manufacture a wide array of products, ranging from our thriving craft beer industry to Vermont-made peanut butter, candles, chocolates, and cheeses. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize one of Vermont's outstanding small businesses, Jasper Hill A small, rural creamery in the Northeast Kingdom, Jasper Hill Farm exemplifies our State's essential balance of innovation and tradition. Andy and Mateo Kehler have worked for more than 15 years to make the best cheese possible, all while remaining true to their Vermont roots.  Now an award-winning artisan cheese business, Jasper Hill Farm began two decades ago when the brothers Kehler pooled their resources to buy a small farm in rural Greensboro, They decided to try a new model of small-scale, value-added dairy farming that would transform raw milk into a more valuable product before leaving the farm. To do so, Mateo and Andy built a creamery with space to age cheese next door to the barn. After 5 years of hard work, the brothers finally had their first marketable cheese.  What started as a few racks of cheese with a couple of direct customers quickly expanded, as did the farm's notoriety. Within 3 years, Jasper Hill Farm took home ``Best of Show'' at the American Cheese Society Despite their hard-earned success, Andy and Mateo continued with their vision of increasing access to value-added production for all interested farmers. They took new measures to create opportunities for community success, opening their space to other cheesemakers. Now, the creamery is home not only to numerous cheese caves, but to a modern laboratory where scientists work to create cheese starter cultures. Years of research have enabled the creation of better cheese, and Jasper Hill Farm has become a magnet for other artisan cheesemakers along the way.  Andy and Mateo have created an outstanding business that is rooted in the Vermont values of hard work and perseverance, while emphasizing the importance of community. Their efforts to reinvigorate the State's dairy industry have contributed to our State's identity and culture, as well as our agricultural traditions. I am proud to feature the work of Jasper Hill Farm at our annual Taste of Vermont event, and I look forward to seeing what their future brings.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times article about Jasper Hill Farm be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 6, 2017]             Small Cheese Makers Invest in a Stinky Science                         (By Larissa Zimberoff)       Greensboro, VT--There's no sign announcing that you've      arrived at Jasper Hill Farm, a creamery in the Northeast      Kingdom, as Vermonters call that end of their state, but you      can't miss it. The main barn is painted midnight blue with a      giant cheese moon and cows floating happily in space. Blasted      into the hillside is a concrete bunker with seven cheese      caves radiating from a central core.       There's one other surprising detail: a modern two-room      laboratory filled with microbiology equipment and staffed      with scientists.       Why does a small, rural creamery invest in technology for      what has long been a low-tech product? Because it doesn't      have 500 years to learn what its European counterparts      already know: the biological intricacies of how to make the      best cheese in a particular place. And because the same      diversity of microbial cultures is not available in North            ``Building a lab might seem extravagant or of questionable      value, but what we get as a business over two, three, four      generations--it's a no-brainer,'' said Mateo Kehler, who owns      the farm with his brother,       The making of cheese depends on the contribution of myriad      microbial actors. Both yeast and bacteria are components of      the starter cultures that help turn milk into solids, and      those solids into cheeses with distinctive aromas, flavors      and textures that are hard to resist. The interplay of these      species, while understood in a basic sense, is now receiving      renewed scientific scrutiny and appreciation in the United            Unlike their peers in Europe, who benefit from centuries of      tradition and from government support for research, American      farmstead cheese makers have typically gone it alone. Starter      cultures are a particularly vexing ingredient. The only three      domestic suppliers, including DuPont and Cargill, are      multinational corporations better known for chemicals, which      has limited the number of available cultures and caused      discomfort in a field that strives for individuality.       But now several small cheese producers are working with      scientists to develop their own starters and use microbiology      to create better cheeses.       Murray's Cheese is working with Rockefeller University to      learn more about the microflora in its cheese caves in Long      Island City, Uplands Cheese Company is working with      the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin      to create a new soft cheese, its first in seven years.       But perhaps none have taken on cheese science as rigorously      as Jasper Its laboratory, opened in 2013, has become a      hub for other cheese makers seeking help and insight.       When the Kehler brothers began making cheese in 2003, their      aim was to invigorate the local dairy industry, which was,      and still is, struggling. They started on their path to      applied science in 2010, when Rachel Dutton,[[Page S2044]]     a Harvard scientist, decided to use cheese as a model to      research how small microbial communities interact; she      focused on the composition of cheese rinds.       Her first contact in the cheese business was Mateo Kehler,      who taught her to make cheese and then helped her reach out      to more than 100 other producers for samples. The response      was overwhelming. ``I don't think she realized how excited      the artisan cheese industry was going to be,'' Mr.Kehler      said.       In 2014, Dutton published her findings in the journal      Working with Benjamin Wolfe, a postdoctoral researcher,      she reported that the environment (cows, cheese caves,      pastures) and methods (washing, salting, managing acidity)      were as important to the development of cheese rinds, if not      more so, than the ingredients.       This was a revelation. With this new scientific proof in      hand, the Kehlers stopped adding starter cultures to      Winnimere, one of their most popular raw-milk cheeses. ``What      we were adding wasn't growing, and when we stopped adding      that, the cheese ripened more gracefully and deliciously,''      Mateo Kehler said.       Their pasteurized cheeses, though, still needed starters      because pasteurization kills bacteria both good and bad for      cheese. So they began making starter cultures from bacteria      in their own milk supply.       Besides ending their reliance on big business, this has      allowed the brothers to create a cheese that can come only      from a singular place: Greensboro,       An on-site laboratory has its perks. In addition to having      staff members who deeply understand microbiology, Jasper Hill      Farm has become a magnet for researchers near and far. Now      working there are an engineering intern from Brittany,      France; a local microbiologist; and Panos Lekkas, a food      microbiologist who has investigated the best ways to feed,      tend and milk a cow for cheese production.       Lekkas, who was hired in November to work full time at      Jasper Hill, collaborates with Dutton, now at the      University of California, San Diego, and with Wolfe, who      leads a microbiology laboratory at Tufts       In addition to helping improve food safety procedures at      the 85-person Jasper Hill Farm, Lekkas is overseeing the      development of a new cheese--a French Camembert style that      for now the team is calling Wild       Lekkas was told that it takes eight months to bring a      new cheese to market. ``Mateo wants me to do it in three,''      he said. With science comes speed.       In order to make a soft pasteurized cheese that does not      rely on corporate additives, the scientists sampled 300      promising strains of yeast and bacteria, all pulled from milk      from Jasper Hill's own 250 cows.       What makes a homegrown starter promising? Sometimes it's      the color of the microbes in a petri dish, but smell, too,      can be telling. The group sniffed the samples and noted any      pleasing aromas: Play-Doh, Concord grapes, tomato juice,      clams, Kraft American Wolfe's lab ran a full      genomic sequencing on the 15 top contenders, which will      provide a blueprint for understanding how these strains are      related to, or differ from, other cultures in the cheese      world.       Making funky cheese is tricky, even for scientists. ``There      are subtle variations in flavor and aroma that you perceive      in cheese,'' Wolfe said. ``We want to understand what      drives that variation.'' With Wolfe's genomic data, the      team can track the microbes through the entire cheese-making      process.       In November, the first batch of cheese was produced using      five strains from the original 15 parent cultures--two yeast-     based and three bacterial. New batches are being made every      two weeks using different combinations, and every 10 days,      each will be tasted to see whether it is on target for the      ``deliciousness factor,'' Jasper Hill's zero-to-10 grading      system.       Seven or above is pretty good. Eight is out of this world.      Tens are likely to be bestowed only outside the farm: Jasper      Hill's Harbison cheese recently took Super Gold at the World      Cheese Awards in       ``I will be happy with a seven,'' Lekkas said.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2043.txt,1383,REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY,2017.0,28.0,March

1177,topic-id,1203,"Mr.President, I wish to speak for just a few minutes about H.43. I see this as a misguided and unfortunate attack on healthcare for women. Certainly that is what I am hearing from women from the State of  Three months into the 115th Congress, the Senate has yet to consider real legislation aimed at addressing the many challenges we Americans face today. Instead, the Senate, with simple-majority votes--permissible through the rarely used Congressional Review Act--is rolling back key protections for the American people that were put in place by the last administration. Never mind that the current administration has the power to address certain aspects of regulations that they wish to rewrite. They could address these. They could seek a rewriting of them. They could seek legislation. But, instead, Republicans in Congress are intent on using this blunt procedure to unravel years of very careful and deliberative work. These raw power plays are part of the Trump-Republican ``know-nothing, anti-science'' agenda, in which the winners are not the American people. They are not the women of my They are not the average person you might meet. Instead, they are typically the wealthy and powerful special interests and big polluters. They win, and the losers are real  Today, we are considering the 12th such resolution, one that rolls back protections under the Title X program. Title X of the Public Health Service Act is the only Federal grant program dedicated to providing those eligible with comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. In rural areas--and every single State has a rural area, but my State is especially rural--we know that Title X is crucial in making sure women have access to the basic healthcare they need. Unfortunately, in recent years, some States have made exceptions about which providers may deliver services under Title X, excluding family planning clinics.  Seeing the burden these rules would place on women seeking healthcare, the Obama administration finalized a regulation in December 2016 that protects these providers from this type of discrimination, and women from these hardships. The resolution we are considering today would undo this regulation, once again allowing States to discriminate against providers, thereby limiting access to healthcare services for millions--that is not hyperbole; it really is millions--of women and their families. Worse still, the resolution would prevent a similar rule or regulation from being implemented in the future.  In Vermont, our sole Title X provider is Planned Even in a State as rural as Vermont, no one has to drive longer than 45 minutes to reach a clinic. That is important to us. We consider 4 to 5 inches of snow a heavy dusting, but we often have 10 to 15 inches of snow. Nobody should have to drive farther than that to reach healthcare.[[Page S2129]]  This type of access is critical for those who need these services. It is especially important because for 40 percent of women, their visit to a family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive during the year. Vermonters are lucky because our State recognizes that this issue isn't about abortion, it is about ensuring the best network of providers for the people of our But other States have already worked to undermine family planning clinics like Planned  The passage of this resolution will allow these discriminatory efforts to advance, especially discriminatory efforts against women. There is no question about it: A vote for this resolution is a vote against women. This resolution would not only affect the lives of millions of American women, but it would also affect the lives of men and young people who trust and depend on family planning clinics for their basic healthcare needs, including for annual health exams, cervical and breast cancer screenings, and HIV screenings.  Last year in Vermont--keep in mind that Vermont has a population of just over 600,000 people--Planned Parenthood centers provided vital primary and preventive services to more than 16,000 patients. In a small State like Vermont, this harmful impact cannot be overstated.  Those who support this resolution argue that the States should be able to determine who receives Title X grants, and that women under this program can simply find another clinic to go to. Well, that is simply not the case. In fact, that argument is false. It is a lie. Family planning clinics overwhelmingly serve populations in rural and medically underserved parts of the country where access to healthcare, especially for low-income individuals, is difficult.  It is easy--easy--for Senators to vote to cut off this healthcare for women and children and people in rural areas because each one of us, if we need healthcare, can walk 2 minutes down this hall and walk to the Capitol physician and say ``I am a U.I need healthcare,'' and we are going to get it. While that may be the reality for 100 people in this body, it is not the reality for millions and millions of people in every single State we represent.  What this partisan resolution would do is force women and families in States who depend on family planning clinics for their healthcare to find another doctor--and often very few are available--or what is more likely, go without care at all. So they don't get preventive care, they don't get checkups, and they don't find the first indication that they may be facing melanoma or some other serious health problem. That undermines all of our efforts, which we should be joining, to strengthen our Nation's healthcare system, to try to make our healthcare system at least as good as many other countries', and to ensure access to care for everyone.  This Republican resolution marks just the latest overreach and intrusion into women's healthcare.  We even voted for a resolution to allow people to spy on what you do on the internet, and then sell that information for their own profit, destroying your privacy, but making money doing it.  Until the House failed to even take it up, the Senate was scheduled to consider a reconciliation bill this week that would have defunded Planned Parenthood and would have allowed health insurers to deny coverage for maternity care, thus requiring women to pay more for health insurance.  In the last Congress, it was more of the same--deny coverage for maternity care, and then go out and say: We believe in the right to life. Clearly not so much for the mother when she needs maternity care.  Should we really walk back from the remarkable progress we have made as a nation in women's health? Of course not. But I am concerned that we will still see the same irresponsible attack surfacing again and again.  Look, it is 2016; it is not 1917. It is time for the mean-spirited and ideological assaults on women's healthcare to end. Women are not second-class citizens. My wife is not, my daughter is not, and my three granddaughters are not. They deserve the same access to care as men.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution that will degrade the healthcare and access to healthcare, of so many  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, has been strongly supported by the United I commended President Morales when, shortly after taking office last January, he extended CICIG's mandate. He has affirmed that he supports CICIG's mandate through September 2019, for which, again, I commend him.  Last week, I expressed a concern that had been conveyed to me by several individuals that President Morales might recommend against renewal of Mr.Velasquez as commissioner beyond September 2017, when Mr.Velasquez's current term expires. In response, according to press reports, President Morales denied this and said he supports Mr.Velasquez for as long as Mr.Velasquez does the job he is supposed to do.  Ivan Velasquez is a respected former judge from Colombia who has carried out his responsibilities as the commissioner of CICIG with professionalism. He and Attorney General Aldana have collaborated on sensitive, complex cases, which until recently would never have been prosecuted in Guatemala, given its history of impunity. It is important that their collaboration continue for as long as possible.  I welcome President Morales's public statement of support for CICIG and for Mr.Velasquez, particularly at a time when the U.Congress is again being asked to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to support the Alliance for Prosperity That plan, which is in its early stages, has the potential to make progress in combating the poverty, lack of opportunity, inequality, violence, and impunity that are among the key contributors to migration from Central America to the United These are deeply rooted problems that the Central American countries and the United States have a strong interest in working together to address.  For the Alliance for Prosperity Plan to succeed, each of the Central American governments needs to take steps that their predecessors were unwilling or unable to take. Those steps include ensuring that senior government officials and their advisers are people of integrity; redefining the antagonistic relationship between government and civil society, to one of mutual respect for each other's legitimate role; fully supporting efforts to combat corruption by CICIG and by the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras--El Salvador should also recognize the important role these entities are playing and support the establishment of a similar commission to combat corruption and impunity in that country--increasing the budget of the Office of the Attorney General, so they have the necessary personnel, training, equipment, and protection to carry out their responsibilities throughout the country, especially in areas where they have never had the resources to operate; supporting the independence of the judiciary, including the selection of judges based on their qualifications and the principle of equal access to justice; and building transparent and accountable institutions of democracy that can withstand attempts to subvert the rights of the people, including demilitarizing law enforcement and building professional, civilian police forces.  It is the responsibility of the Central American governments to take these steps and, by doing so, create the conditions for building more prosperous, equitable, and just societies. If they do that and they meet the other conditions in U.law, the United States should support them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2148.txt,1383,TOPICS OF THE DAY,2017.0,30.0,March

679,topic-id,1167,"Mr.President, the most solemn and serious and consequential act that the United States can undertake at any moment is to make the decision to send Americans into war. From time to time, war may be an unfortunate decision but a necessary decision--a necessary and potentially tragic function of any republic. And it might be necessitated by the need to safeguard the rights and the freedoms of the government's own citizens from foreign states--from those who would harm us. Yet we should enter into those wars and enter into any alliances that could lead to war only after utmost deliberation and strategic consideration, focusing specifically on the well-being of the American citizens--those people whom we are sworn to protect, those people whose safety is at stake whenever we go to war.  That is why, for the past several months, I have asked that the Senate have a rollcall vote on the measure to ratify Montenegro's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty, and that is why I will be casting my vote against expanding NATO later today.  Of course, treaties and alliances with other countries can be beneficial; there is no question about that. But the Founders of this country understood that their seriousness needs also to be considered--that the seriousness of a treaty needs to be taken into account in the same way that you have to consider very carefully the seriousness of going to war, and for the very same reasons. That is why both of these powers--the power to make and ratify treaties and the power to declare and execute war--are given not to one single branch of the Federal Government, but rather they are shared by the legislative and executive branches acting together. In addition to this, treaty ratification requires not just a majority vote, but a two-thirds supermajority vote within the  The United States should enter into treaties and alliances with foreign nations that will enhance the ability of American citizens to exercise their rights and freedoms and to safeguard those same people. At the heart of the NATO alliance is the article 5 guarantee for collective defense, stating, in essence, that an attack against any one NATO ally will be perceived and responded to as an attack against all. This means that the United States is obligated by treaty to make war because of an attack on an ally, and those allies are obligated to us for the same purpose and to the same extent. This, of course, is a very significant agreement. It is one that we should never take lightly. It is never one that we should just assume into existence any time we have a decision to make.  Simply put, I don't see how the accession of Montenegro--a country with a population smaller than most congressional districts and a military smaller than the police force of the District of Columbia--is beneficial enough that we should share an agreement for collective defense. Montenegro becoming a member of NATO is certainly attractive to European countries because it makes the United States the security guarantor of yet another country in a region prone to instability and ethnic unrest, but that doesn't automatically make it of interest to the American people. It doesn't automatically mean that the benefits outweigh any risks to the American people by bringing this country into  On the other hand, I believe the risks could outweigh the benefits to the detriment of the American people and result in more of our servicemembers being deployed overseas and at risk. The resolution of ratification on which the Senate is voting states that ``an attack against Montenegro, or its destabilization arising from external subversion, would threaten the security of Europe and jeopardize United States national security interests.''  This makes NATO responsible not only for external security but for combating destabilization in a historically volatile part of the world. Undertaking obligations like this only increases the likelihood of Americans being placed in harm's way, of our brave young service men and women having to go into a potential field of battle.  Further, expanding NATO does not address some of the systemic problems that U.administrations from both sides of the aisle have long pressed to their European counterparts: the failure of many NATO countries to meet decades-old defense spending obligations and the increasingly concerning behavior of some NATO members.  For example, several weeks ago it was announced that American military personnel are now being used in northern Syria for the purpose of preventing infighting between one of our NATO allies--Turkey--and our Kurdish allies in the coalition against This was followed in short order by a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and the Netherlands--both NATO allies--in which the Turkish President accused the Dutch Government of fascism. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in February rejected calls from the Trump administration, which were similar to pleas from the Obama administration, for European countries to increase their own defense spending in fulfillment of their existing obligations through  Addressing such issues is much more vital to the future of NATO and American interests in Europe than further rounds of expansion.  Finally, some of my colleagues have argued that we should move forward with Montenegro's accession into NATO because the Russians oppose it, just as the Russians have opposed all previous rounds of expansion. This is not the basis for a sound foreign policy. While the United States should not let another country have a veto over our national security decisions, it would be equally unwise for the United States simply to engage in certain actions just because geopolitical adversaries might oppose them. Such reactionary statecraft contradicts the ideals of prudence and practicality that our Founders hoped would guide our foreign policy.[[Page S2027]]  On a more practical level, it still doesn't mean that we should just be willing to put our Armed Forces in a position where our brave young men and women might have to go into harm's way as a result of the fact that a geopolitical adversary takes the opposite viewpoint.  Further, elected officials should not have their patriotism or loyalty to country questioned because of their understandable concerns about national security, treaty obligations, and war. There are many thoughtful leaders and policy experts who have legitimate concerns--both, about Russia's behavior and about the direction of NATO--and who support meaningful pressure against Russia through economic and diplomatic means, as well as the modernization of our strategic deterrent and missile defense systems.  This vote, of course, is likely to pass and Montenegro will become the newest member of NATO this year. It is my sincere hope that the country will be a constructive force in addressing the operational and mission problems that I have described and that the Trump administration will press for needed reforms. But I also hope that American diplomatic leaders and Congress will work to identify and act on the security interests most relevant to the American people and think more strategically about our alliances and treaty partners in the future.

928,topic-id,2383,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court of the United  Last week the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, held a week-long series of hearings concerning Judge Gorsuch's nomination. After listening to the judge's flawless testimony, after listening to him answer questions from my colleagues for days on end, I am even more convinced than ever that he is exactly the kind of jurist we need on the Supreme Court of the United  I want to briefly explain my support for the judge, and then respond to some of the criticisms that have been leveled against him.  First and foremost, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper and necessarily limited role of the judiciary in our constitutional  Last week, over and over, Judge Gorsuch affirmed--even against great criticism that at times can be difficult to understand in its entirety--but responded time and again to criticisms by pointing out that it is his job as a[[Page S2064]]judge to interpret and apply the law--not to make it, not to establish policy, but to apply that policy which has already been placed into law by the legislative branch.  When you are reading law, the text matters. Our laws consist of words and each word matters. If the law leads to an uncomfortable outcome for the parties, for politicians, or for anyone else in our society, then, it is our job as a Congress--or if it is State law at issue, it is the job of a State legislature--to get the policy right, to fix the policy problem at issue. The judge's job is to go where the law leads the judge, not to correct the law.  Over and over, Judge Gorsuch affirmed the importance of precedent in our system. It is clearly a topic that he takes very seriously, having coauthored a treatise on that very subject. While precedent is not always absolute, in so far as you have a clear conflict with the text, Judge Gorsuch testified that you start with the ``heavy presumption in favor of precedent.'' He described precedent as the ``anchor of the law.''  Over and over, Judge Gorsuch explained that judges are not partisans in robes. No, they are different. They are different from politicians. They are meaningfully different than the politicians who make the laws or the politicians in the executive branch who enforce and execute the laws. They are unfailingly independent when they are doing their jobs right. They are devoted to the rule of law. They do their best to decide cases on the basis of the law and the facts, rather than on the basis of achieving whatever outcome they or others might desire.  Some of my colleagues' views of Judge Gorsuch's record are different, and I want to address some of their concerns. First, some of my colleagues have questioned the independence of Judge Gorsuch and his ability to exercise judicial independence. This is a very serious accusation. In fact, it is probably one of the worst things you could say about a judge. So my colleagues who have raised this criticism would need to back that up against something. If you are going to raise a really serious accusation against someone, as you are whenever you are calling into question a judge's independence, you have to be able to back it up.  Let's look at that. Can they back it up? I don't think so. In fact, I am quite certain they can't because they haven't. The argument boils down to the complaint that Judge Gorsuch hasn't sufficiently criticized President Trump's comments about judges. But here is what Judge Gorsuch said about this topic last week. He said this in response to questions raised by Senator Blumenthal on the Judiciary He said:       Senator, I care deeply about the independence of the      judiciary. I cannot talk about the specific cases or      controversies that might come before me, and I cannot get      involved in politics.       But, Senator, when you attack the integrity or honesty or      independence of a judge, their motives, as we sometimes hear,      Senator, I know the men and women of the Federal judiciary, a      lot of them. I know how who hard their job is, how much they      often give up to do it, the difficult circumstances in which      they do it. It is a lonely job, too. I am not asking for      crocodile tears or anything like that. I am just saying I      know these people, and I know how decent they are. And when      anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity, the motives of a      Federal judge, well, I find that disheartening, I find that      demoralizing, because I know the truth.  Senator Blumenthal asked Judge Gorsuch whether, when he said ``anyone,'' that applied to the President of the United Judge Gorsuch responded simply: ``Anyone is anyone.'' It is true that Judge Gorsuch didn't use the magic words: I disagree with President But he can't get involved in politics. He said here what he can say. In fact, he said all he can say in this context.  Moreover, here are some additional parts of Judge Gorsuch's testimony, which shed light on this issue.  From Tuesday:       I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party other      than based on what the law and the facts in the particular      case require, and I'm heartened by the support I have      received from people who recognize that there's no such thing      as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have      judges in this country.  On Wednesday he said:       I do not see Republican judges, and I do not see Democrat      judges. I see judges.  So I think any fairminded person looking at this would have to agree that Judge Gorsuch's feelings about judicial independence in cases before the Federal judiciary are very clear. To my colleagues who might see the issue differently, I would ask simply: What should Judge Gorsuch have said without getting involved in politics, without miring himself in a debate that is within the political branches of government and, therefore, within the political rather than the judicial interpretive arena?  Second, some of my colleagues allege that Judge Gorsuch is somehow out of the mainstream. But consider these facts. Judge Gorsuch has decided roughly 2,700 cases. His decisions have been unanimous 97 percent of the time. Keep in mind that he is an appellate judge who sits on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Appellate judges never sit alone in that capacity. They sit in panels--normally in panels of three and sometimes in panels of a dozen or so when they sit on the bench. And 97 percent of the time, all of the judges with whom Judge Gorsuch sits in any case agree with whatever decision he reaches. He is in the majority 99 percent of the time.  He is about as likely to dissent from a Republican-appointed judge as a Democratic-appointed judge. He has been reversed twice, and in both cases he was following circuit precedent. I want to make it clear that there is nothing wrong with a judge who dissents more than this. In fact, in many instances, dissents are necessary. In many instances, a dissent can be useful, even indispensable. There are judges out there who dissent more than this, and there wouldn't be anything wrong with Judge Gorsuch if he dissented any more. My point is that of all the arguments you can make against Judge Gorsuch, this is not a fair characterization. To say that he is out of the mainstream simply runs against mathematics. It runs against the bold statistics on their very face, which contradict this characterization.  Some of my colleagues respond that only a handful of cherry-picked cases matter. If you watched the hearing last week, you might recognize the names of some of these cases. They include TransAM Trucking, Hwang, Luke P., Hobby What I find revealing is that my colleagues never mount much of a legal argument against any of these decisions. No, you are not going to find quibbling with the statutory construction in these cases. They don't parse the statutes at issue and then explain where it is that Judge Gorsuch somehow got it wrong, somehow departed from what the law actually says. No, they are looking at outcomes. They think Judge Gorsuch should have bent the law in order to go where they think the law should go. They want judges who have the right approach in mind, the right outcome in mind, and to decide the case according to what outcome they desire.  I flatly disagree with this view of judging. It is a view, frankly, that is way out of the mainstream in American law. To say it is out of the mainstream in American law does not mean out of the Republican mainstream or the conservative mainstream or the mainstream among members of the Federalist No, I am talking about rank-and-file practitioners of the law, jurists from every conceivable point along the political and ideological spectrum. This is just not something that a judge would ever want to admit to doing. Certainly, it is never anything a judge would aspire to do--to choose an outcome and say: I am going to reach that outcome, and I don't really care that the law doesn't really authorize me to do it. I am just going to do it because I think, in some abstract sense, that outcome would achieve a greater degree of fairness than what the law actually requires me to do.  Third, I am distressed by a lot of the rhetoric that we heard during the confirmation hearing last week--rhetoric that I expect to continue and even mount over the next 10 days or so. One of my colleagues last week actually went so far as to describe the Supreme Court of the United States as an ``instrument of the Republican party.''  Other colleagues have complained about the so-called dark money campaign to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and still other colleagues complain that President Trump or Steve[[Page S2065]]Bannon or Reince Priebus or others are enthusiastic about Judge Gorsuch's nomination, as if the fact that someone is supported by someone they don't like means that the person in question is not qualified. This is unfair to Judge  Judge Gorsuch didn't decide Citizens He didn't decide Hobby Lobby or any other case my colleagues dislike. He made clear in no uncertain terms that no one speaks on his behalf but him.  They may dislike some of the cases in which he offered opinions, but, again, in those cases, they are not quibbling with the way that he interpreted the law. No one has attacked his interpretation of a statute, his approach to statutory construction. They are quibbling with the outcome. They are quibbling with the fact that they wish it had turned out differently on policy grounds, policy grounds that have everything to do with the policymaking arms of the government and not with the jurisprudential arm of the government.  Even worse, these types of statements are damaging to our judiciary. If you don't like a judicial decision, engage the decision on its own terms, engage in a discussion of how that decision turned out wrong or where it is that it departed from what the law requires. Make a legal argument, in other words.  The courts announce reasons for their decisions. There is plenty of material to dig into, but don't impugn the judge's motives or independence. This is especially harmful when you impugn the judge's motives without actually getting into what the judge did or what the law says and explaining how those two things diverge.  Don't accuse the Supreme Court of functioning as an instrument of the Republican In fact, you might as well call someone a so-called judge in a case where you disagree with the outcome. In fact, calling someone a so-called judge is probably no worse than calling the Supreme Court of the United States an instrument of the Republican  Finally, I want to talk about the filibuster. The minority leader has urged his colleagues to filibuster. The minority whip has announced he will filibuster. Only two Democrats have said they will vote yes on cloture, so here we are.  I ask my colleagues: If Neil Gorsuch can't get 60 votes for cloture, which Republican nominee can?  Some of my colleagues have argued that if a nominee can't get 60 votes, the President should find a new nominee. I ask my colleagues: Was that the standard for several of President Obama's nominees at the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit?  Well, yes, it was. Under rule XXII, that was the standard. That was the standard until, in November of 2013, the Democrats in the Senate went nuclear, and they created a new precedent, taking that threshold down from 60--by precedent--to 51. Through going nuclear, this is the result they achieved.  Their analysis, in its entirety, went in this direction. Their analysis nuked the Executive filibuster. It nuked the filibuster on the Executive  Interestingly, although some were insisting at the time and went to the floor to explain at the time that they didn't intend for this to extend to Supreme Court nominees, when everyone thought Hillary Clinton would be President--Harry Reid admitted that the Democrats would extend this same precedent through which the Democrats had nuked the Executive filibuster to Supreme Court nominees.  So, look, I work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on a great number of important issues, issues that are very important to me, issues like criminal justice reform, reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, reform of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, which is badly in need of reform, and a number of other issues, many of which involve privacy protections. These are A-plus legislative priorities for me. Nothing else is more important, and I stand ready to reform the law whenever I see the need to do so and will continue to work with my Democratic colleagues.  As we approach this discussion, I want to be clear that unilateral disarmament doesn't work. I hope the Democrats reverse course and do not filibuster this nominee, but if they do, I am confident Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed.

580,topic-id,720,"Mr.Speaker, under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House are: ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''  The dignity and integrity of the House's proceedings have been violated, and continue to be violated, because Congress has not had the constitutionally afforded opportunity to consent to emoluments being received by the President or to enforce, if consent is not given.  I would note that Congress has the authority to request the President's taxes under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and use of this authority would not be unprecedented, as it was used in 1974 to request President Nixon's tax returns that revealed that he owed nearly half a million dollars in back taxes.  I would note that issues of the Constitution and the House's prerogatives under the Constitution have a precedent in using rule IX as a privileged resolution.  For example, if a revenue measure is initiated in the Senate instead of in the House as required by the Constitution, that is a matter of a privilege of the I would argue that the Emoluments Clause is at least as important, possibly more important, than the origination of a revenue measure in either the House or  I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee for 22 years. I am well aware of how the Judiciary Committee operates and the need for individual Members to do research before any official action is taken in that committee. And since it is the Judiciary Committee, it has the first responsibility for adhering to the Constitution among the committees of the I think it is absolutely essential for the President's tax returns to be released so that the members of the Judiciary Committee can do their job to research whether the Emoluments Clause has been violated and whether permission should be given to the President to receive payments from foreign states.  I would note that there is no question that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution was placed there to prevent corruption in the system. It was based on a sad experience during the Articles of It is necessary to make sure that the President and all other officers of the United States have loyalty to only one thing, and that is to the United States of America, not to any foreign power.  In order to do that, we need to review the data. As I say, the dignity and integrity of the House requires that the Constitution be upheld, and in order to uphold the Constitution, we must have this information.  For these reasons, the resolution raises a question of the privileges of the House and should be permitted, Mr. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

(e) Public Participation.--Section 8 of such Act (42 U.S.     4365) is amended by amending subsection (h) to read as      follows:       ``(h)(1) To facilitate public participation in the advisory      activities of the Board, the Administrator and the Board      shall make public all reports and relevant scientific      information and shall provide materials to the public at the      same time as received by members of the       ``(2) Prior to conducting major advisory activities, the      Board shall hold a public information-gathering session to      discuss the state of the science related to the advisory      activity.       ``(3) Prior to convening a member committee or      investigative panel under subsection (e) or requesting      scientific advice from the Board, the Administrator shall      accept, consider, and address public comments on questions to      be asked of the The Board, member committees, and      investigative panels shall accept, consider, and address      public comments on such questions and shall not accept a      question that unduly narrows the scope of an advisory      activity.       ``(4) The Administrator and the Board shall encourage      public comments, including oral comments and discussion      during the proceedings, that shall not be limited by an      insufficient or arbitrary time restriction.

1027,topic-id,670,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank Chairman Smith and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Biggs for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. I also thank my good friend, Representative[[Page H2566]]Peterson for, yet again, working--helping, I should say--to make this bill a bipartisan effort. I appreciate his willingness to sponsor this bill with me.  I had the opportunity to speak in favor of this legislation when it passed this House with bipartisan support in the 114th Now, I come to the floor yet again to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important reform. The SAB Reform Act was a good bill then, and it is a good bill now. This is a policy that is built on the values we should uphold regardless of which side of the political aisle we are on or who happens to be the  H.1431, the Science Advisory Board Reform Act, ensures the best experts are free to undertake a balanced and open review of regulatory science. The Board was established to provide scientific advice to the EPA and Congress, and to review the quality and relevance of science EPA uses for regulations. But in recent years, shortcomings with the process have arisen. Opportunities for public participation have been limited, potential conflicts of interest have gone unchecked, and the ability of the Board to speak independently has been curtailed.  If the administration undermines the Board's independence or prevents it from providing advice to Congress, the valuable advice these experts can provide is wasted.  Despite the existing requirement that the EPA's advisory panels be fairly balanced in terms of point of view represented, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has identified a number of past problems that have undermined the panel's credibility and work product. These include a number of advisory members who received money from the At the very least, this could create the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Some of the panelists have taken public and even political positions on issues they are advising about. For example, a lead reviewer of the EPA's hydraulic fracking study published an anti-fracking article titled, ``Regulate, Baby, Regulate.'' Now, this clearly is not an objective viewpoint, and should be publicly disclosed.  Public participation is limited during most board meetings. Interested parties have almost no ability to comment on the scope of the work, and meeting records are often incomplete and hard to obtain.  This bill is both pro-science, and pro-sound science. This bill is founded upon recommendations for reform outlined by the National Academy of Sciences, and the EPA's Peer Review This bill ensures that the Board is balanced, transparent, and independent, all of which will help prevent the SAB from being manipulated by any group.  H.1431 makes sound science the driving force of the Board, no matter who is the chief executive officer of our government.  Perhaps most importantly, this bill seeks to increase public participation that benefits all stakeholders. Currently, valuable opportunities for diverse perspectives are limited. The Federal Government does not have a monopoly on the truth. Ask your constituents back home if they know that.  The public has important expertise that can't afford to be ignored in a democracy. State, local, tribal, and private sectors have a long history of qualified scientific experts. Their contributions should be taken seriously.  Unfortunately, the history of the SAB shows that private sector representation is often lacking or simply nonexistent. Instead, in the past, EPA has picked the Board, ignoring the knowledge, experience, and contributions of those experts. This bill ensures that qualified experts are not excluded simply due to their affiliation. This will add value and credibility to future Board reviews.  Mr.Peterson and I recognize the important role science should play in our policy debates and provides safeguards to give the public confidence in science. It restores the independent Science Advisory Board as a defender of scientific integrity.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

To the Members of the U.House of Representatives: The      U.Chamber of Commerce supports the ``Honest and Open New      EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA      Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.'' These bills      would improve the transparency and reliability of scientific      and technical information that Federal agencies rely heavily      upon to support new regulatory actions.       The HONEST Act is designed to ensure that the studies and      data Federal agencies cite when they write new regulations,      standards, guidance, assessments of risk--or take other      regulatory action--are clearly identified and available for      public review. Additionally, information must be sufficiently      transparent to allow study findings to be reproduced and      validated. This is a critical safeguard to assure the public      that the data Federal agencies rely on is scientifically      sound, unbiased, and reliable.       The EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 would      help ensure that the Science Advisory Board (SAB), which      directly counsels the U.Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) on key scientific and technical issues, is unbiased and      transparent in performing its duties. The bill would      establish requirements that SAB members are qualified      experts, that conflicts of interest and sources of bias are      disclosed, that the views of members--including dissenting      members--are available to the public, and that the public has      the opportunity to participate in the advisory activities of      the Board and view EPA's responses. Because EPA relies on SAB      reviews and studies to support new regulations, standards,      guidance, assessments of risk, and other actions, the actions      of the SAB must be transparent and accountable. This is a      critical safeguard to assure the public that the data Federal      agencies rely on is scientifically sound and unbiased.       The HONEST Act and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform      Act would improve the transparency and trustworthiness of      scientific and technical reviews and information that      agencies, including EPA, rely on to justify regulatory      actions that can significantly affect society. The American      public must have confidence that the scientific and technical      data driving regulatory action can be trusted. Accordingly,      the Chamber supports these important bills.           Sincerely,                                              Neil Bradley,                              Senior Vice President & Chief Policy     Officer, Government                                  ____                                   American Chemistry Council,                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2017.     Frank Lucas,     House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington,       Dear Vice Chairman Lucas: On behalf of the American      Chemistry Council (ACC), we want to thank you for introducing      H.1431 ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017,''      to help improve the science employed by the U.     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Agency's      regulatory decision making processes.       The proposed legislation would increase the transparency      and public confidence in the EPA's peer review panels.       The Science Advisory Board Reform Act would improve the      peer review process--a critical component of the scientific      process used by EPA in their regulatory decisions about      potential risks to human health or the environment. The Act      would make peer reviewers accountable for responding to      public comment, strengthen policies to address conflicts of      interest, ensure engagement of a wide range of perspectives      of qualified scientific experts in EPA's scientific peer      review panels and increase transparency in peer review      reports.       We commend you for your leadership and commitment to      advance this important issue. We look forward to working with      you and other cosponsors for quick passage of H.1431.

Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House          of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the National Cotton      Council, thank you and your committee for the work on the EPA      Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 (H.1431) and the      Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017--HONEST      Act (H.1430). We support both of these critically      important bills in an effort to return sound science and      transparency to the regulatory process that affects our      members and all of agriculture.       The NCC is the central organization of the United States      cotton industry. Its members include growers, ginners,      cottonseed processors and merchandizers, merchants,      cooperatives, warehousers and textile manufacturers. A      majority of the industry is concentrated in 17 cotton-     producing states stretching from California to U.     cotton producers cultivate between 9 and 12 million acres of      cotton with production averaging 12 to 18 million 480-lb      bales annually. The downstream manufacturers of cotton      apparel and home furnishings are located in virtually every      state. Farms and businesses directly involved in the      production, distribution and processing of cotton employ more      than 125,000 workers and produce direct business revenue of      more than $21 billion. Annual cotton production is valued at      more than $5.5 billion at the farm gate, the point at which      the producer markets the crop. Accounting for the ripple      effect of cotton through the broader economy, direct and      indirect employment surpasses 280,000 workers with economic      activity of almost $100 billion. In addition to the cotton      fiber, cottonseed products are used for livestock feed, and      cottonseed oil is used as an ingredient in food products as      well as being a premium cooking oil.       As you know, agriculture struggles with many factors in the      production of fiber, food, and fuel, but the regulatory      impact and burdens on our industry have greatly increased      over the last several years. In addition, we have found      ourselves unable to adequately defend and maintain many of      our crop protection products and technologies because we are      often unable to access the data used by federal government      agencies to place additional restrictions on these products      and technologies. We believe these two bills--H.1430 and      H.1431--will greatly improve the transparency of      regulatory review process. These two bills will substantially      enhance the role of sound science that was intended to be a      centerpiece of the regulatory process.       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues in      Congress to get these bills enacted into law.

Sincerely,                                                    Reece Langley,     Vice President--Washington                                  ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space and Technology, House          of Representatives, Washington,     Eddie Bernice Johnson,     Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space and Technology,          House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: The U.     Chamber of Commerce supports the ``Honest and Open New EPA      Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA      Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.'' These bills      would improve the transparency and reliability of scientific      and technical information that Federal agencies rely heavily      upon to support new regulatory actions.       The HONEST Act is designed to ensure that the studies and      data Federal agencies cite when they write new regulations,      standards, guidance, assessments of risk--or take other      regulatory action--are clearly identified and available for      public review. Additionally, information must be sufficiently      transparent to allow study findings to be reproduced and      validated. This is a critical safeguard to assure the public      that the data Federal agencies rely on is scientifically      sound, unbiased, and reliable.       The EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 would      help ensure that the Science Advisory Board (SAB), which      directly counsels the U.Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) on key scientific and technical issues, is unbiased and      transparent in performing its duties. The bill would      establish requirements that SAB members are qualified      experts, that conflicts of interest and sources of bias are      disclosed, that the views of members--including dissenting      members--are available to the public, and that the public has      the opportunity to participate in the advisory activities of      the Board and view EPA's responses. Because EPA relies on SAB      reviews and studies to support new regulations, standards,      guidance, assessments of risk, and other actions, the actions      of the SAB must be transparent and accountable. This is a      critical safeguard to assure the public that the data Federal      agencies rely on is scientifically sound and unbiased.       The HONEST Act and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform      Act would improve the transparency and trustworthiness of      scientific and technical reviews and information that      agencies, including EPA, rely on to justify regulatory      actions that can significantly affect society. The American      public must have confidence that the scientific and technical      data driving regulatory action can be trusted. Accordingly,      the Chamber supports these important bills.           Sincerely,                                              Neil Bradley,                              Senior Vice President & Chief Policy     Officer, Government                                  ____                                                    March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Chairman, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: The American Exploration & Production      Council (``AXPC'')[[Page H2569]]     and the Independent Petroleum Association of America strongly      support the enactment of both the EPA Science Advisory Board      Reform Act and the Honest and Open New EPA Science-Treatment      Act and are most grateful to you and your committee for your      efforts in respect of the important objectives set forth in      each of these pieces of proposed legislation.       AXPC is a national trade association representing 33 of      America's largest and most active independent natural gas and      crude oil exploration and production companies, each with      considerable experience drilling, operating, and producing      oil and natural gas on federal lands. AXPC members are      ``independent'' in that their operations are limited to      exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.      Moreover, its members operate autonomously, unlike their      fully integrated counterparts, which operate in additional      segments of the energy business, such as downstream refining      and marketing. AXPC members are leaders in developing and      applying innovative and advanced technologies necessary to      explore for and produce oil and natural gas, both offshore      and onshore, from non-conventional sources.       IPAA represents the thousands of independent oil and      natural gas explorers and producers, as well as the service      and supply industries that support their efforts, that will      most directly be impacted by the U.Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) policy decisions to regulate methane      directly from the oil and natural gas sector. Independent      producers develop about 95 percent of American oil and      natural gas wells, produce 54 percent of American oil, and      produce 85 percent of American natural gas. Historically,      independent producers have invested over 150 percent of their      cash flow back into American oil and natural gas development      to find and produce more American energy. IPAA is dedicated      to ensuring a strong, viable American oil and natural gas      industry, recognizing that an adequate and secure supply of      energy is essential to the national economy.       The EPA's Science Advisory Board is a critical link in the      EPA's policy making process and must, therefore, be unbiased      and motivated only to seek the best possible policy result      based on the best possible, publicly available, verifiable      data. Moreover, open, public debate must be encouraged, not      discouraged. The goal must be to get the best possible      result, which is why the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform      Act should be enacted.       Science used to support or as a basis for regulations or      other policies should be based on publicly available      scientific and technical data so as to allow for and even      encourage independent fact finding and analysis. Transparency      is critical to this process. The Honest and Open New EPA      Science Treatment Act would accomplish this result.       AXPC and IPAA urge passage of both of these critical pieces      of legislation and stand ready to assist in any way you      believe we might be able to add value to this process.       Should you have any questions or require additional      information contact AXPC or Thank you for your good      work on these and other issues.           Very truly yours,     Bruce Thompson,       President,     Lee Fuller,       Executive Vice President,                                  ____                                                CO2 COALITION,                                     Arlington, VA, March 8, 2017.     House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington,       Dear Representative Lamar Smith and the Committee: The CO2      Coalition supports the purpose and principles of the ``Honest      and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017'' and the      ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.'' We would,      in fact, support such principles applied on a government-wide      basis.       The scientific method demands that the results of      scientific studies be capable of replication. While it is      generally up to individual scientists, journals and the      larger scientific community as to how the replication      requirement is satisfied, when it comes to science used to      set public policy, there can be no doubt that the relevant      methods and data must be publicly available for purposes of      replication.       With respect to the federal government obtaining      independent science advice from outside advisors, it goes      without saying that advisory panels should not be unduly      influenced by members hoping to curry government favor or to      advance personal agendas. Panels should be truly independent      and unbiased. Clear and enforceable standards will help meet      this goal.           Sincerely,                                                   William Happer,     President, CO2                                  ____                                                         CATO,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House          of       Dear Congressman Smith: Recently, Committee staff sent me      copies of two draft pieces of legislation, the ``HONEST Act''      and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017''.       The Cato Institute interprets its tax-exempt status as      precluding any specific support of adoption (or      recommendation of rejection) for pending legislation.      However, I can comment on substantive aspects of such      legislation.       The HONEST Act would require that regulations promulgated      by EPA be backed by reproducible and transparent science. In      the are of climate change, this will surely provoke a timely      inquiry as to whether the climate models that are used to      calculate the Social Cost of Carbon, and the justification of      subsequent regulations, are indeed ``science''. I would argue      that they are not.       A climate model is merely a complicated mathematical      statement of multiple hypotheses. These include a prediction      of a general warming of surface temperatures, and a greater      warming of the tropical troposphere. All subsequent changes      in weather regimes--such as rainfall, winter snows, and      Atlantic hurricanes derive from the warming and its      distribution.       As such, a reasonable test of hypothesis would be to      examine the performance of these models as carbon dioxide has      accumulated in the atmosphere, and during the period in which      we have multiple, independent measures of bulk atmospheric      global temperatures, which would be from 1979 to the present.      As I noted in recent (February 28) testimony, there is a      clear systematic failure of these models, with the central      estimate of warming generally twice as large as what is being      observed as a whole in the troposphere, and as much as seven      times larger than what is being observed in the tropical      upper troposphere.       This, and other recent refereed publications are finally      beginning to detail the subjective fashion by which the      equilibrium climate sensitivity is being derived, argue that      these models do not constitute science in the classical      sense. It would be more appropriate to call the field      ``climate studies''.       Litigation deriving from the HONEST Act is likely to      uncover this problem, with the likelihood that EPA's 2009      Endangerment Finding, which empowers subsequent regulation of      carbon dioxide, should be vacated because of a lack of      verifiable science associated with its determination.       The other piece of legislation will open up the EPA Science      Advisory Board(s) to more institutional diversity and less      political selection.       I hope you find my comments useful, and stand available to      answer any questions or provide any amplifications you may      desire.

1033,topic-id,583,"Mr.Speaker, I would note to the body, part of the challenge that we face here today on this bill is like so many challenges we face as Members of Congress: How do you avoid the short-term perspective? How do you take the long view? How do you set into motion things that, while they might not, perhaps, give us the great advantage in the short-term sense that either side of the room would want, in the long-term, they are in the best interest of the body?  I would remind my colleagues, the Scientific Advisory Board is appointed by the EPA; the EPA is managed by the Director; the Director is appointed by the President of the United If you believe that the work product, if you believe that the rules that have been generated by this in recent years reflect your perspective, I understand that, but nothing is ever static.  We have recently had a change of administration. We have a change of direction in the leadership of the That will be reflected in all the appointments and the actions of the  I implore my colleagues, we need to work in the perspective of what is in the long-term interest; and that long-term interest is providing scientific review at the SAB that our fellow citizens have confidence in and that will generate good rules and regulations when they have to be created.  Following this course of action advocated in H.1431 will not make my most conservative constituents happy because they want to duplicate what they believe my most liberal constituents have advocated for years, but our goal here is not to empower one or the other side in these perspectives to force their will upon the country. Our responsibility with the SAB is to create a process where we can have confidence in the results and where, when appropriate, the end resulting regulations, the rules that come from it, will be in the best long-term interest of the Nation as a whole.  I know there are requirements in here that, if you have taken money as a scientist to do a research project from the EPA, you have to cool off for 3 years. But what is wrong with allowing a little separation between the people who take money to do the studies and then become the judges of other studies in the knowledge that perhaps the people who have done the studies will judge their studies? What is wrong with that?  And the public disclosure about allowing people with knowledge and expertise to participate, too, if they have[[Page H2570]]a conflict through these disclosures, we will know. I would hope that whoever leads the EPA on whatever day would act in a responsible fashion.  I just want, through this bill, to change the system so that the perception is out there that the SAB and the scientific process and the rulemaking that comes from it at EPA are being gained by one perspective or the other because that is in no one's best interest.  I know we live in tough times and challenging times to legislate. I think my colleagues know, in the legislation I have worked on before, that I have always worked across the aisle. I have always worked with every perspective within this body. I have always tried to take that long-ball perspective. I know it is a challenging time, but think about that as we continue this well-meaning, good-spirited, very focused debate.  I reserve the balance of my time.

National Association of                                                Home Builders,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the 140,000 members of      the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am      writing to express NAHB's strong support for the Honest and      Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 and the EPA      Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. These bills would      ensure an open and honest scientific process by allowing the      public access to the science that underpins regulations      developed by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and      ensuring that scientists advising the EPA on regulatory      decisions are not the same scientists receiving EPA grants.       It is important for the EPA to use sound science in order      to support their rulemakings. Far too often, the EPA relies      on science that lacks transparency and reliability to      buttress their rulemakings. This is a consequence of the EPA      conducting their scientific review of rulemakings behind      closed doors. The EPA frequently ignores scientific integrity      by limiting public participation, excluding state and private      sector expertise, and pushing a specific agenda by appointing      scientists who are biased. In some cases, scientists that      have been appointed to review proposed regulations have      received EPA grants which the EPA disregards as a conflict of      interest.       The EPA should not be able to create costly regulations      without being transparent, fair and open to public input when      considering the science behind a rulemaking. However, the EPA      has sacrificed the integrity of the rulemaking process by      using biased science to push their agenda. It is important to      address these shortcomings so that future rules can be      transparent and honest.       For these reasons, NAHB urges the House Science, Space and      Technology Committee to support the Honest and Open New EPA      Science Treatment Act of 2017 and the EPA Science Advisory      Board Reform Act of 2017, in order to bring transparency and      integrity to the regulatory process.       Thank you for giving consideration to our views.           Sincerely,     James Tobin III,       Executive Vice President & Chief Lobbyist, Government      Affairs and Communications                                  ____                                                  Small Business &                                        Entreneurship Counsel,                                        Vienna, VA, March 7, 2017.     Frank Lucas,     House of Representatives,     Washington,     Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Science, Space and Technology Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith and Representative Lucas: On behalf of      the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council)      and its more than 100,000 members nationwide, I am pleased to      voice our strong support for the ``EPA Science Advisory Board      Reform Act of 2017.''       This important legislation reforms the Environmental      Protection Agency's (EPA's) Science Advisory Board (SAB) and      its subpanels by strengthening public participation,      improving the process for selecting expert advisors,      expanding transparency requirements by board members, opening      the board's research to public review, and limiting      nonscientific policy advice. The reforms proposed by the      legislation are especially critical given the growing impact      of EPA's regulations on America's small business sector, the      controversial science used as the basis to advance certain      rulemakings, and the need to ensure that sound science is      guiding EPA actions.       Balance, independence and transparency are critical to      EPA's scientific advisory process. The bill addresses key      concerns with the SAB, such as placing limitations on its      members who receive environmental research grants, applying      conflict of interest standards, and ensuring balanced      representation on the board's membership.       These are sensible reforms that will strengthen the SAB's      integrity and work, and by extension EPA's regulatory      process.       SBE Council supports solutions that improve the regulatory      system to ensure the voice of small businesses and      entrepreneurs is heard and considered, that they operate and      compete under rational rules, and transparency throughout the      regulatory process. The ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform      Act of 2017'' is an important legislative initiative that      brings fairness, transparency and objectivity to the SAB and      EPA rulemakings.       Please let SBE Council know how we can further support your      efforts to advance this important legislation into law. Thank      you for your leadership, and support of America's small      business and entrepreneurial sector.           Sincerely,                                                   Karen Kerrigan,     President &                                  ____                                            National Stone, Sand &                                           Gravel Association,                                                   Alexandria,       The National Stone Sand and Gravel Association supports      both The Honest and Open New Science Treatment Act of 2017      (HONEST Act) and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of      2017.       Both acts go a long way towards addressing many of the      current issues our industry has with regulatory science, and      we encourage the House Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology to mark up both pieces of legislation.       Our association represents 100,000 jobs across the United      The regulatory burden on our workforce dramatically      impacts our ability to provide cost-effective materials for      America's roads, runways, bridges and ports. Our members      pride themselves on their commitment to environmental      stewardship and are heavily involved in sustainability and      reclamation in their communities.       Federal regulations must balance industry's voice and      environmental and health concerns. Unfortunately, we often      see problems in the scientific underpinnings of regulations      when agencies select studies that are neither public nor      reproducible as the basis of new rules. This practice chips      away at the credibility of any regulatory action and makes it      difficult for industries to respect the regulatory process.      Our members have the right to comment on regulations and it      is not reasonable to ask hard working men and women of any      industry to trust that an agency has selected good science      without if an agency is not being transparent.       Stakeholder input in the regulatory process is required      under federal law and valuable for the justification and the      implementation of rules.       NSSGA stands ready to work with Congress to ensure that      industry, states and the scientific community can work      together openly and honestly to create regulations.

Chairman Lamar Smith,     The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington,              Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson,     The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington,                Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Bernice Johnson: The      Portland Cement[[Page H2573]]     Association (PCA) supports the EPA Science Advisory Board      (SAB) Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest and Open New EPA      Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) of 2017. PCA is the      premier policy, research, education, and market intelligence      organization serving America's cement manufacturers. PCA      members represent 92 percent of U.cement production      capacity and have facilities in all 50 states. The      Association promotes safety, sustainability, and innovation      in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous      improvement in cement manufacturing and distribution, and      generally promotes economic growth and sound infrastructure      investment.       PCA supports these bills because they would improve      fairness and transparency in the regulatory process, while      promoting use of the best available science. As you know, SAB      reform is needed to update and strengthen the scientific      foundation of EPA's regulatory decisions. The SAB Reform Act      would improve the Science Advisory Board by ensuring balance      among its members and providing better public access to      scientific information and data. SAB reform is an important      step toward improving EPA's regulatory process, public access      to information, and transparency.       The HONEST Act would similarly improve transparency and      access to information. Scientists reviewing agency studies      and rulemakings need a fair chance to evaluate and validate      the studies EPA relies on in the rulemaking process. The      HONEST Act protects the sensitive and confidential      information often covered by confidentiality agreements,      while allowing EPA to make critical information available for      public comment and access. The HONEST Act follows the data      access requirements of many scientific journals. This level      of transparency and potential for peer review are critical to      improving regulatory decisions.

The      American Farm Bureau strongly supports this legislation and      pledges our commitment to work with the committee in pressing      for its swift consideration.       This legislation is a priority because it reforms the SAB      process by strengthening public participation, improving the      process of selecting expert advisors, and expanding the      overall transparency of the While the SAB should be a      critical part of the scientific foundation of the U.     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory process,      EPA has systematically used its authority to silence      dissenting scientific experts. Rather than promote fairness,      transparency and independence to ensure unbiased scientific      advice, EPA routinely has ignored its own Peer Review      Handbook and silenced dissenting voices on expert panels.       This legislation seeks to reinforce the SAB process as a      tool that can help policymakers with complex issues while      preventing EPA from muzzling impartial scientific advice.      This legislation deserves strong, bipartisan support. We      applaud your leadership in this effort and will work with you      to ensure passage.

Lamar Smith,     Chairman, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: We are writing to express our strong      support for H.1430, the ``Honest and Open New EPA Science      Treatment Act of 2017'' (HONEST Act), and H.1431, the      ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.''       For too long now, the Environmental Protection Agency has      hidden key scientific data from the public and corrupted its      own boards of outside science advisors. This subversion of      science and the regulatory process has produced costly, job-     killing regulations of dubious-to-no merit to public health      and the environment.

1038,topic-id,449,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, again, I reiterate to my colleagues, this is a situation where the goal really is not to empower one perspective or one faction over another. The goal, ultimately, of this bill--and, yes, this did come out of the inspector general's report, the initial work and effort. The goal of the bill is to add transparency, accountability. The goal of the bill is to increase the American people's confidence in the work product that is then used by the EPA to craft the rules and regulations that impact every life in this country on a daily basis.  Whatever your perspective may be, remember, the pendulum in this great Nation, when it comes to the executive branch, in my time, every 8 years, has swung back and forth. Just because at the present moment or the past moment you think you got your perspective's way, or if perhaps you think with the pendulum swing now you will get your perspective's way, that is not what the focus should be here.  I would also remind my colleagues, in my 23 years, I have served in the minority soon to be for 4\1/2\ years. But the other 18\1/2\ years, I have served in the majority. I have served in the majority. So when I step up to you and say we can do better, we can enhance the quality of information, we can do it in a way that the American people have more confidence in ultimately what goes on, and we can do it in a way that makes it more difficult for anyone to hijack the process, I say that sincerely.  There is nothing wrong with full disclosure for everyone who can add to the process, who should be available for consideration. There is nothing wrong with a financial cooling-off between benefiting from the studies and analyzing someone else's studies. There is nothing wrong with this.  But if you stay with the status quo, this Board and this Agency are in change. Get ready for 8 years of a dramatically different way of doing things.  Now, maybe you are so confident that the pendulum will swing back again that you are willing to accept that. But as for me, I want to stay between the lines. I want to focus in ways that, for the long term, represent the best interests of this great country.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for H.1431. I ask my colleagues to think about 10 or 20 years down the road. I ask my colleagues to put the long-term best interests of their constituents first.

1044,topic-id,439,"Mr.Speaker, I look at this language--and I am a farmer by trade; I am not an attorney; I will confess that--but the phrase ``or other entity'' seems to be a very broad concept. How will that affect people who work for research foundations at institutions of higher education? How will that affect entities, people who are part of so-called think tanks in places like Washington, D.C.? I personally believe the language is intended more to simply turn the bill inside out.  On that basis, I would ask my colleagues to reject the motion to recommit with instructions and to pass the underlying bill.  But I go one step further, and I offer this in the most sincerest of ways: if you look at the discussion today and if you look at the discussion that has gone on for some time on these issues, it is almost as though there are those with certain perspectives who are trying to force their will--their perspective of what is right and wrong scientifically or economically or socially--on the rest of the country, on the rest of us, and, for that matter, on the rest of the world.  That is why I am the author of this bill. No one entity should have the power by manipulating the bureaucratic process or the rulemaking process to enforce their definitions of everything on the rest of us. We have both the right and the responsibility to judge this information and to make decisions about what is in our enlightened self-interest, as the old economist would say, or in the best interest of the country or of society as a whole.  That is why I want all of us--the great American people--to have access and some certainty about the people and the process that are driving everything in our world.  Reject the motion, pass the bill, create greater transparency, incorporate more input, and when it is necessary to have rules and regulations, generate good rules and regulations so that we all have a chance to prosper and to live up to our potential in this country. Don't let the tyranny of the idealistic--whatever perspective they may have--drive us all into despair and destruction.  With that, I respectfully ask my colleagues to reject this motion and pass the underlying bill.  I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr.Speaker, I have received countless visits, calls, letters and emails from constituents about this bill. I have heard from hospitals, doctors, patients, nurses, parents of children with serious illnesses, researchers and the list goes on. They have one thing in common: they are afraid of what TrumpCare could do to their patients and to their families.  H.1628 will not bring down health care costs or improve access. Indeed, by slashing Medicaid by $880 billion, it will force States to ration care for our most vulnerable populations. In Massachusetts, this cut will put the health of 1.9 million people at risk, including 650,000 children, 170,000 seniors and 280,000 people with disabilities. My state is also being hit hard by the opiate addiction crisis and cutting Medicaid will cripple our ability to address that problem. It is also a disgrace that the funding being cut out of Medicaid is being handed over to insurance companies and the wealthiest Americans in a $1 trillion tax break for the rich.  TrumpCare slashes $175 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund, cutting its solvency by three years and hurts seniors by letting insurance companies charge older Americans five times more than they do young ones. The yearlong bar on reimbursements to Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services means that women will have to go without health screenings, pre-natal care and well-woman visits. And according to the C.B.O., 24 million Americans will no longer have health insurance coverage.  All this begs the question, how does this bill provide better care for Americans?

927,topic-id,3190,"Mr.President, we have come to a crisis in our country. My State of West Virginia has the highest drug overdose death rate in the West Virginia reported 818 overdose deaths last year--four times the number that occurred in 2001 and a nearly 13-percent increase over 2015. We lost more than 700 West Virginians who died from an opioid overdose last year. Some 42,000 people in West Virginia, including 4,000 youth, sought treatment for illegal drug use but failed to receive it because of a lack of treatment centers, which we have been trying to correct. In West Virginia, drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent since 1999.  West Virginia had the highest rate of prescription drug overdose deaths of any State last year--31 per 100,000 people. In West Virginia, providers wrote 138 painkiller prescriptions for every 100 people. Think about this. Doctors are prescribing and manufacturers are producing. They have written 138 painkiller prescriptions for every 100 people in my State--the highest rate in the country. I hope Arkansas is not facing the same dilemma we are.  Every day in our country, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose. Opioids now kill more people than car accidents. In 2015, the number of heroin deaths nationwide surpassed the number of deaths from gun homicides. Since 1999, we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription drug opioid abuse.  Mr.President, 2.1 million Americans abuse or are dependent on opioids. According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users abused prescription opioids before moving to heroin. Heroin use has more than doubled among young adults ages 18 to 25 in the past decade. Forty-five percent of the people who used heroin were also addicted to prescription opioid painkillers. Between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent of Americans suffering from opioid addiction participated in any form of addiction treatment.  Misuse and abuse of opioids cost the country an estimated $78.5 billion in 2013 in lost productivity, medical costs, and criminal justice costs.  Every week, I come to the Senate floor to read letters from West Virginians and those struggling all throughout our country with opioid abuse. The reason I do this is because it is a silent killer. We don't talk about it. There is not one of us in the Senate, not one of us in Congress, not one of us in any gathering who doesn't know someone in our immediate family, extended family, or a close friend who hasn't been affected, but we would never talk about it because it was so embarrassing--how did it ever break down in our family, whether you had a model family or you thought you did. This is a killer. Whether Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, this is a killer. It has no discretion. It has no partisan base. It goes after one and the other. So this is what we are dealing with.  The letters I read have a common theme: They all mention how hard it is to get themselves or loved ones into treatment. Sometimes it takes months, and sometimes it never happens. This problem stems from our lack of a system to help those who are looking for help. We need permanent funding to create and expand substance abuse treatment facilities to help people get clean and stay clean.  I know the Presiding Officer has heard this before, but that is why I introduced the LifeBOAT The LifeBOAT Act puts one penny per milligram of opiates--basically, one penny for every milligram of opiates produced in America, consumed in America--into a fund that pays for treatment centers. In the Presiding Officer's beautiful State of Alaska and my State of West Virginia, people need treatment. This is an illness. I used to look at it 20 years ago as basically a criminal act, and we put them in jail. Guess what. They came out of jail just as addicted as they went in. Nothing changed, so I am willing to change. I have always said that if you can't change your mind, you can't change anything. This is an illness that needs treatment, and we are responsible for that. This lifeboat would establish a steady, sustainable funding stream to provide and expand access to substance abuse treatment.  Today I am going to read a letter from parents from West Virginia who lost their son to drug abuse. This is Renee and Criss's letter, which they want me to read. This fine-looking young man was a father, and this is such a tragic ending to this story.       Dear Senator Manchin,       I am writing to you in the hope of bringing to light the      devastating effects of heroin addiction, overdose death and      the difficulty in finding treatment for those afflicted with      the disease and their families.       On November 12th, 2016, we lost our 23-year-old son, Nick,      who died from what we thought at the time was a heroin      overdose. When Nick's autopsy report came back, we discovered      that his body contained no trace of heroin in his system. He      had died from a fatal dose of straight fentanyl.       Nick was a quiet, kind and inquisitive child. He learned to      speak and read at an early age and spent most of his time      absorbed in books and riding his bike and scooter. He also      loved playing in the woods and dreaming up adventures with      his sisters and neighborhood friends. He was a protective big      brother, and he had a natural way of connecting with kids who      were ``different'' and making them feel accepted.       Nick was always tall for his age. He came into this world      on July 5th, 1993, weighing in at 10 pounds and topped off at      6'8"". He loved sports and excelled in basketball and soccer.      He even met you when you were Governor Manchin, after his      basketball team traveled to Charleston, WV, to celebrate      their A State Basketball Tournament Championship in 2011.       After high school he went on to play basketball for the      Glenville State College Nick wasn't able to keep      his grades up and had to drop out of Glenville after the      first semester of school. Shortly after that, he met a girl.      They instantly connected, and he soon became a father to her      daughter. After several years together, they had a son of      their own.       After having difficulty holding down jobs and providing for      his family, Nick came to me in November of 2015 and told me      that he was addicted to opiate prescription drugs. We had      suspected drug use for quite some time but didn't realize the      extent of it. He said that he could no longer live the life      he was leading and needed help. Nick and his girlfriend had      started using opiate-based prescription drugs after she was      prescribed them for her recovery from the birth of her      daughter in 2013. At first, they would make trips to the      doctor or quick care with fake ailments in order to get their      prescriptions. If they couldn't get prescriptions, then they      bought from drug dealers. The pills were easy to get up until      the time he came to me for help.       I told my husband about Nick's drug problem, and not      knowing what to do, we turned to the Internet as a source of      information. We found a lot of information and many treatment      centers across the country. I began calling a few of the ones      that looked reputable, but in each case, they required three      to five thousand dollars up front for a 28 to 30 day      treatment. The question now was: Were these treatment centers      as good as they appeared to be on their websites or were they      simply out to make a profit and marketing their centers to      bring in more patients?       While we researched and tried to make a decision, Nick, not      wanting to be away from his family, went through detox at      home and had convinced him and us that he could do this on      his own. Nick made it through his first round of self-detox      but started using again for a short while at the end of      We confronted him, and he immediately started his      second round of self-detox. He again swore that he could do      this himself and was finished with the life he was leading.      We were still trying to figure out what to do with him and      what would happen to his family while he was gone. We didn't      know that his girlfriend was also using and detoxing along      with       After speaking to several people at a local treatment      center and trying to arrange for him to be admitted, we were      told that they wouldn't take him because [of] our insurance.      My next course of action was to call local counseling centers      that offered addiction counseling, hoping that they would be      able to offer advice. Each one I called politely told me that      they couldn't help.       Nick's addiction, and our focus on him, was taking away      from our being able to celebrate and focus on our other      children, Nick's two sisters. We decided to put Nick on the      backburner while we prepared for our daughter's graduation      party and the school events that preceded it, thinking that a      few weeks wouldn't hurt. Were we ever wrong!  It is a sad scenario when a family has to hope that their child gets arrested[[Page S2063]]and gets a conviction record so they can go to a drug court to get treatment, that that is the only help they have.       One of our daughters had learned that Nick could get      treatment if we pressed charges against him for theft. He      would be charged, then court-ordered to be sent to an      addiction treatment center. She felt that this was the best      course of action to get Nick the help he needed, but Criss      and I were hesitant because of the negative impact a felony      charge would have on Nick's life if the charges weren't      expunged after completing his treatment.  Which is our what we call fresh start or last-chance bill, which the Presiding Officer has been so graciously looking at and hopefully will be a part of this. It is a shame they fall into this.       Our decision to not go this route caused even more anger.  Since they knew that, hindsight being 20/20, this was the only way to get Nick help.       Little did we know that, by late-March or early April, Nick      and his girlfriend had decided to celebrate their being clean      by using heroin ``just this once'' as a reward for staying      clean.  They were rewarding themselves by using heroin to celebrate being clean. Now, understand, that is not proper thinking. That is not rational common sense.       In the past, the two had snorted heroin but had never      injected it. When they went to buy from their dealer, he told      them that since they didn't have much money and there were      two of them, they could get a better high with less heroin if      they injected it. And that was the beginning of a rapid      decline.       On June 2, 2016, Nick had his first overdose. Without our      knowledge, his girlfriend had taken Nick, along with the      children, to the emergency room, where he was treated and      released within a few hours. Unbeknownst to us, this      initiated a call to CPS that would result in her daughter's      father taking custody of her and CPS involvement for Nick and      his girlfriend and their son.       At the hospital, Nick and his girlfriend talked with a      doctor out of Pittsburgh about They agreed to try      the program. I traveled with Nick, his girlfriend and her      mother for the first visit to They had a high      success rate, and it was decided that once the treatment was      established, the two would go to Pittsburgh once a month for      drug testing, counseling and their Suboxone prescriptions.      The clinic would line up additional support services in      Parkersburg or close by. We were very impressed with the      clinic, their staff and their program, which only took on 100      patients at a time.       Criss came to the next meeting two weeks later to speak      with the counselors and was now more comfortable with the      treatment plan. Unfortunately, when the counselors tried to      set up local support services, they were shocked to find the      small number of places that treated addiction and the fact      that the ones that were here would not provide services for      patients who were not in their program. The decision was made      to increase their sessions to twice a month and eventually      once a week when it became apparent through consistent      ``dirty'' screens that the two were struggling with the      program [and still using].       In August, his girlfriend suffered an overdose. The      Pittsburgh Clinic called shortly after that and said that      they were releasing the two from the program, letting us know      that they needed a more intense treatment plan than they      could provide. I called the CPS case worker and addiction      counselor that were assigned to watch over the children and      monitor the two after Nick's overdose in We all met at      the house to determine the next course of action. After      numerous phone calls, we were able to find an ``open'' bed in      Las Vegas, Nevada, for Nick, while his girlfriend would      decide the following week to go to a treatment center in      Fairmont,       In less than a week, Nick was on a plane to Vegas, eager to      begin a new, clean life. He was upbeat and positive before he      left, excited by the prospect of finally leaving behind the      life of addiction that he'd been living for so long. During      his phone calls home, he had positive things to say about his      treatment. He was staying in nice homes that were part of the      treatment center. Along with their daily treatment schedule,      they were taken on hikes and went go-cart racing. He even had      a manicure at the facility's salon. The purpose of these      activities was to teach the patients natural ways of      experiencing highs.       Nick's release date was scheduled for October 3rd. There      were longer-term treatment plans offered at the facility, but      Nick missed his son and worried about his girlfriend and      wanted to come home. The treatment center had set up group      sessions for him three times a week for a period of about six      weeks.       Nick came home on a beautiful, sunny day. I waited at home      for him with his son, who had been staying with me, and his      other grandmother.  I wish we had this picture of his son, a beautiful little boy.       When I saw Nick for the first time, he looked beautiful. He      looked and acted like the Nick that we had known before      addiction. He told us about his stay in Vegas and was      literally shining with hope! He told me, ``Mom, I will      never go back to that life!'' And I believed it was      possible.       That hope began to fade pretty quickly. Nick had started      working about six weeks before he left for rehab. It had      taken him a long time to get that job and he enjoyed it and      felt that he could actually provide for his family if he      could work his way up. However, after rehab he was unable to      secure a job. Nick was going to his scheduled group sessions      and going to nightly NA meetings for support. Nick finished      up his six weeks of group therapy. He was so proud when he      received his ``sixty day's clean'' chip at the NA meeting.      Seven days later he and I spent part of the afternoon      together. He wanted to look for a job and I had some errands      to run. He dropped me off where I needed to be and applied      for jobs. When I finished, he picked me up and I took him to      Sam's Club to show him cute toys for his son for      We picked out a racetrack together and I showed him a few      other things I had bought for my grandson. I had mentioned      that Criss might get his son a basketball hoop for Christmas      and he told me, ``No Mom, I want to buy that for him with my      own money.''       We had a good afternoon together. He had made plans for the      evening, to meet up with some of his high school friends who      were in for the weekend. He left my house around eight      o'clock and I heard him return around 12:35 am. All of his      friends later said that he'd had a good night. He was happy      and smiling and there was nothing to indicate that there was      anything wrong. Shortly after I heard Nick come in, my      grandson's crying woke me up and I woke to change him, give      him a bottle. I headed back to bed and noticed the light on      in the bathroom and knocked and opened the door. It was      around 1:45 am and Nick was lying on the bathroom floor with      no pulse and not breathing. I called 911 and began      Within minutes the ambulance arrived. They worked on him for      some time while I spoke to the police officer then they took      him out to the ambulance.

1199,topic-id,489,"Mr.President, we are here today because Republicans' discrimination against women knows no boundaries. They think a woman's right to choose is still up for discussion. It is not.  Let me be clear. A woman's right to choose is a discussion for a woman and her doctor. That is it. A healthcare provider receiving Federal funds should be judged on their ability to serve a patient. That is it.  Today, Republicans are voting on a measure that would allow States to discriminate against family planning providers simply because they do not like the populations they treat or the services they provide. It would embolden a State to restrict Federal funding for only health centers that serve primarily minority populations or patients who identify as LGBTQ, and it would allow a State to strip away Federal investments in family planning[[Page S2137]]clinics that serve women's reproductive health needs.  These are not hypothetical concerns. Women's reproductive care is under attack by extreme rightwing Republicans across this country. State politicians introduced more than 500 bills restricting access to reproductive healthcare in 2016, enacting more than 60 new abortion restrictions last year.  Let's be clear. The result of today's vote means that there will be less access to care for women and families across this country. Health centers receiving title X funding provide basic primary and preventive healthcare services, such as HIV testing and contraception, to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 healthcare centers nationwide. It is because of the work done at these centers that we are now at a 30-year low in unintended pregnancies, a historic low in teen pregnancies, and we have the lowest rate of abortions since the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was legal in 1973. We are a healthier Nation because of family planning clinics that receive title X funding.  Now, more than ever, we need to stand and raise our voice against the Republican Party's agenda of discrimination. It is about fighting for the freedom to make decisions in our personal lives without the fear of interference from our own government. It is about the access to opportunity that comes from quality, affordable healthcare and making sure that access is never restricted, no matter what gender you are. But with Donald Trump as President and both Chambers of Congress now controlled by the GOP, national Republicans are in the best position in decades to enact a radical agenda that rolls back women's rights. Today is just one step in their massive plan to take women's rights right back to the 19th century.  I know they will not back down from enacting their radical agenda, but I also know that we who want to protect women's rights will not back down from this fight. It is a historic battle.

1192,topic-id,604,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today, just as I have many times before, to stop another rightwing attack on title X funding and to defend access to healthcare for millions of women.  Not even a week has passed since the American people successfully beat back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and give insurance companies permission to charge women higher premiums simply because of their gender. Yet apparently less than a week is not too soon for Republicans to launch yet another attack on women's access to healthcare. This morning, my Republican colleagues needed the Vice President of the United States to come to Capitol Hill and cast a vote to overturn protections for 4 million patients served by title X funded health centers every year.  For many low-income women, title X funding is the lifeline that ensures their access to birth control, testing for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screenings, and other basic health services. In fact, 85 percent of the people served by family planning centers like Planned Parenthood have incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Approximately 20 percent of these patients identify as Latina, and approximately 14 percent identify as  In 2015 alone, title X funded nearly 800,000 Pap tests, breast exams to 1 million women, nearly 5 million tests for STIs, and 1 million HIV tests. Title X did not pay for a single abortion. Indeed, no Federal funding goes to abortion-related care. And indeed, for every dollar that title X funding spent, we saved about $4 and prevented nearly 2 million unintended pregnancies per year.  Family planning services at New Jersey's title X funded health centers[[Page S2135]]helped prevent 20,500 unintended pregnancies in 2014, which would have likely resulted in 10,000 unintended births and 7,400 abortions. Without publicly funded family planning, the number of unintended pregnancies in New Jersey would be 21 percent higher. Title X funded services produce significant cost savings to the Federal and State governments. Services provided at title X supported sites in New Jersey accounted for nearly $232.9 million in such savings in 2010 alone.  I hope President Trump knows that when my Republican colleagues vote to defund Planned Parenthood, they aren't voting to stop a single abortion; they are voting to defund the family planning care that helps avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion.  A vote to defund title X is a vote to defund breast cancer exams. A vote to defund title X is a vote to defund cervical cancer screenings. A vote to defund title X is a vote to defund testing for sexually transmitted diseases.  The American people--those who voted for President Trump--voted for more affordable healthcare, certainly not less. Not one of my Republican colleagues has come to the floor to make the case in favor of repealing title X--not one. But if my Republican colleagues prevail in this cynical vote, they will jeopardize access to affordable family planning services; they will force many health centers to stop providing care to patients; and they will leave doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers working on the frontlines to abandon those who need them the most.  I, for one, refuse to allow the GOP to pander to the extreme elements of their party and in doing so limit a woman's access to affordable, accessible healthcare. This vote is about every one of our sisters, our daughters, our grandchildren. This vote is about women across this country, and I don't understand how we can take away their access to the healthcare they so critically need.  With that, I yield the floor.

936,topic-id,2040,"Madam President, here in America we hope that families will have the opportunity to build successful lives in preparation for a beautiful retirement. That involves many different factors. It involves the solvency of Social It involves the foundation of a good, living-wage job. It involves, certainly, the question of whether, through one's life, they are able to save for retirement.  This has become more and more important over time because fewer and fewer jobs have a retirement pension plan. Without that, it is really incumbent on the individual to be able to succeed to put money aside, and we know how difficult it is for an ordinary working family to have the extra funds to be able to put into a retirement account. Certainly, we want to make that as simple and as easy as possible. But what we know is that the simplest strategy--which is to be able to save through your work, to be able to have funds automatically deducted from your paycheck so you never actually get it in your hands--is often unavailable.  According to one 2013 study, 40 percent of small business owners themselves had no retirement savings, 75 percent had no plan to fund their own retirement, and of those who are working for employers who hire and have 100 or fewer employees, more than 60 percent--62 percent of the workers--do not have access to a work-based retirement plan.  We can imagine the difference between going to work at a job where the employer says: Hey, we have a retirement plan. You just need to sign this document, and you will be part of it. Please sign up. After a few months, if you feel you can't afford to keep setting those funds aside, you can change what you are doing. You have that flexibility. You can choose between options for different types of investments. But it is all right there. It is all very easily accessible. All you have to do is do it. The difference between that and a situation where there is nothing in the workplace--no benefit in the workplace, no retirement structure--is that in that situation it becomes a much more complicated undertaking.  Fifty-five million Americans--nearly half of private sector workers--work for employers that do not offer any form of workplace retirement saving or pension plan. Roughly 45 percent of working-age households, half of which are headed by someone between 45 and 65 years old, lack any type of retirement account asset.  So if there is no structure to make it simple to plan for retirement, it is more likely that one goes into those golden years without any form of gold; that is, without the resources in the bank to back up Social  We know that more than half of the folks who are on Social Security depend on it for more than 90 percent of their income. Or, more simply stated, for more than half of Americans in retirement, Social Security is essentially their only source of support, and it is often not enough to maintain even the minimal essentials of life.  Why is it that so many businesses don't set up a workplace plan? What it[[Page S2070]]really boils down to is complexity for the employer. A lot of small businesses don't have a human resources person. They don't have an extra individual who can do the administrative work to set it up. Maybe the plan requires a match, and the employer isn't sure they will be able to afford a match. There are all sorts of reasons that this is complicated. It is difficult either financially or just in terms of additive overhead for a small business. So they don't set up the plan.  We know that if they had a plan, employers would participate. We know that because in States that have plans, the employers participate. In addition, the General Accounting Office did a study in 2015 which found that the overwhelming majority of workers would participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan if they had the opportunity to do so.  So this brings us to the fact that many States are saying: Let's make it easier for employees. There are 30 States that are looking at the possibility of the State setting up a retirement plan that wouldn't be attached to a single employer, so that an individual could carry it with them. For example, imagine that your teenager has their first job serving yogurt--one of the jobs that my daughter had--or as a lifeguard at a local swimming pool or serving coffee--those first service jobs they get. What would happen if, from that first job, 3 percent of their income was placed automatically into a retirement account--a retirement account that they could control the options of, a retirement account where they could increase the amount of their income to go into it if they wanted, or a retirement account that they could always opt out of if they chose to do so. But if they were automatically enrolled, we know the vast majority of individuals stay in the plan. If you go, then, automatically from job to job to job--and in our economy that is the way it works; people don't sign up with one company and serve there for 30 or 40 years--in every job 3 percent was being automatically deducted. Then when you actually went into retirement, you would have a sizable nest egg to complement Social  That is what States are looking at. That is what they are pursuing. In more than half of the country, States are considering legislation to create a retirement savings opportunity for small business employees who do not have a work-based plan. Seven States, including my home State of Oregon, are already working at implementing these plans. On July 1 of this year, Oregon is going to launch its plan with a voluntary pilot group, and then it is going to expand to employers with 10 or more workers in 2018 and finally to all employers in the State in 2019.  Under this plan, employees who do not have an employer-provided savings account will be allowed to save part of their paycheck in their own personally managed accounts, and it will be automatically deducted unless the employee decides to opt out. Once it expands to all employers, 800,000 Oregon workers are expected to have access to a State-sponsored retirement savings program. Again, this will be an automatic-in, opt-out strategy to make it really simple.  In Oregon, 95 percent of our businesses are made up of small businesses. More than half of our workers are employed by those small businesses. So this is a pretty good arrangement to facilitate this opportunity.  Now, here is something that we may not immediately think about. When an employee saves for their retirement and is, therefore, financially better off in retirement, it reduces the cost of government programs. Within the first decade after these plans are established, total State spending on Medicaid could drop by $5 billion. In Utah, a recent study found that the State would save $3.7 billion for five essential government support programs--not just Medicaid--over the course of 15 years.  When I first read about Medicaid costs dropping because of a retirement plan, I said: How does that work?  It turns out to be very simple. If you have saved money and are financially better off, you are not in a position where you would be in the Medicaid Program, thus reducing the number of people who are in it. This study found that over 10 years, for the States that are already working to implement plans, California would save more than half a billion dollars; Maryland would save more than $100 million; Connecticut and Oregon, about $60 million a piece; and Illinois, a quarter of a billion dollars. So that is just an interesting piece that we should be recognizing--that when families do better, not only do they do better, but they lower the cost of government programs, which I think many folks here, on both sides of the aisle, would say would be a terrific thing.  Then there is this principle of experimentation at the State level. Why would we in this Chamber, having failed to provide an automatic-in, opt-out opportunity as people move around the country to various jobs, having failed to do a Federal version of this, stop our municipalities and our States from experimenting to see if this is something that will increase the success of our families? Why would we stop a State from experimenting?  Now, I hear all the time here about States' rights. I hear all the time about how States are the place for experimentation, to see what works and what doesn't work, innovation. Give them the opportunity to try things. Well, this Congressional Review Act proposal says the opposite. It says: Let's stomp out experiments by our municipalities. Let's devastate and decree that you cannot experiment and innovate at the State level on a very significant challenge facing So whether you want families to succeed or whether you simply believe in the power of local innovation and opportunity, you should be against this proposal.  What this proposal is about is this: There is a twist in the national retirement law known as ERISA that an employer might possibly have liability related to an employee signing up for a State-sponsored or a municipality-sponsored account. Well, that pretty much puts a wet blanket over employers signing up under these State plans or under these local plans, because the thought that you might have liability for something you have no control over doesn't sound like a good place to be. So to correct or clarify this, a regulation was issued and it should be obvious why it is right, which is that the employer will not have liability over provisions of a State- or municipal-sponsored retirement account. They didn't set it up. The employer didn't advocate it. The employer is not choosing where the investments go within the account. They are not deciding which companies' retirement plans get to participate as options or whether there are even company retirement plans. The employer is not doing any of that. The employer is simply the host. The whole point of the plan is to make it very easy for the employer, because that has been the burden in the past of an employer-by-employer plan. In this case, it is just automatically set up.  In States like Oregon, they are setting up a pilot project, where employers are willing to experiment and be a part of it so they can learn from that. Then, they can design a better plan for larger small businesses, those that have more than 10 employees. Then, they can make it, after having worked the kinks out of it, work for everyone, including very small employers. If along the way they run into an obstacle, they can pause and work on that.  This is absolutely the best in policy strategy in Give municipalities, give States the opportunity to experiment, and on an issue that can help families thrive, help our young ones thrive.  I know that my son and my daughter are going to be better prepared for retirement and in a better financial position if, in every job they pursue in Oregon, they are automatically saving 3 percent of their income--or more if they choose to or less if they opt out. But certainly, the vast majority of workers, once in a plan, stay in the plan. It is kind of how it is with deductions on your Federal and State taxes. When it comes out of your payroll automatically, you get used to it, you adjust to it, and you say: Hey, that works.  So, to my colleagues, please oppose this Congressional Review Act proposition that will squash innovation by municipalities, and its companion will squash programs by States--programs that are very valuable, both for us to understand possible important policies to help set a platform for the success of our families, and it is very important[[Page S2071]]to the families themselves.

943,topic-id,2460,"Mr.President, the most important words in our Constitution are the first three words. Our Founders made sure that, when the Constitution was written, those were displayed--``We the People''--in super-sized font so that, generations later, we would not forget what our Constitution is all about.  Our Constitution was not crafted to create a government that would make decisions by and for the powerful. It was not crafted to create a government that would make decisions by and for the privileged. That was the power of the ``we the people'' vision, as President Lincoln so eloquently stated, ``a government of, by, and for the people.'' Well, that is the vision we have the responsibility of maintaining, and it is a vision that is facing a dramatic test in this coming week--a test that affects the integrity of this body, a test that affects the integrity of the Supreme  Back in January of last year, a Supreme Court seat came open. A Supreme Court seat for which the President had a responsibility to nominate a replacement, a new Justice to serve on the We here in the Senate had a responsibility--a responsibility to exercise advice and consent. That meant that we would vet the nominee, that we would research, have a committee hearing, have a committee vote, and then forward it to the floor, where we would have a floor debate. But for the very first time in the history of the United States of America, the majority party decided that they would not exercise their constitutional responsibility, that they would instead steal this seat from the Obama administration, wrap it up, pack it into a time capsule, and send it into the future, in hopes that they would be able to succeed in packing the Court by having a different President, a more conservative President, proceed to fill the vacancy.  I am going to go through the 16 cases in our history where there has been a vacancy during an election year, and in 15 cases, the Senate acted. But last year, this Chamber refused to act, for the first time, in trying to exercise a seat-stealing, Court-packing scheme, and that diabolical act against our Constitution will have its final chapter of discussion next week. I think it is important that the Members of the Senate understand the history of the United States of America and the setting in which this debate is going to occur.  If you read the Constitution from start to finish, nowhere does it say that the Senate has the option of refusing to consider a Supreme Court nominee in the final year of a This strategy was announced within hours of Judge Scalia dying. And why would the majority choose to reject their responsibility under their oath of office? Why would they choose to do that? Certainly it wasn't because Merrick Garland wasn't qualified. He hadn't been nominated yet. Certainly it wasn't because there was a precedent because there was no precedent in U.history for stealing a Supreme Court seat.  Here is what transpired. The majority said: This might be a nominee who will fight for the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution, and we don't want that because we are committed to a different vision--a vision of government by and for the most powerful people in the United States of America--and we want to make sure that the Court has a 5-to-4 majority to keep turning the Constitution on its head, destroying the vision that this Constitution, our Constitution, was designed for.  Well, the President proceeded to carry out his responsibility despite the fact that the majority said: We are not going to consider your nomination because we are not going to honor our responsibilities under the Constitution.[[Page S2077]]Despite that, the President said he would honor his responsibility, and he nominated Merrick Garland on March 16.  The story here in the Chamber was that if he was on this floor, he would have plenty of votes, far more than 60 votes to be confirmed. So that kind of hardened the opposition, because there were more than 60 Senators who were going to say: Yes, let's embrace this mainstream judge who wants to fight for our ``we the people'' But the leadership said no.  What have we seen unfold over the last few years of dark money ruling American campaigns? In 2014, we saw the Koch brothers decide that they wanted to control this Chamber, so they said: We are going to spend vast sums to elect a majority that will respond to our perspective as billionaires, coal and oil billionaires, kind of like a government by and for the powerful.  So they spent huge sums of money in Arkansas and in Louisiana and in North Carolina and in Iowa and in Colorado and in Alaska and in my home State of Oregon, and they won most of those Suddenly, there was the majority they had hoped for.  Then they sent a warning message to the Republican leadership in the form of this: In January 2015, the Koch brothers said: Pay attention because we plan to spend nearly $1 billion in the next election, 2 years from now, and if you cross us, you might know the consequences because we can spend money in primaries as well as in general elections.  That is the background on how the Senate majority decided to steal this seat for the first time in U.history.  Just to make sure we are checking all of our facts on this, let's take a look at those various vacancies. As I mentioned, there have been 16 in our history. In one group of nominations, those vacancies occurred after the election, so there was very little time for the Senate to act.  Nominee John Jay--President John Adams--was nominated on December 18. At that point in time, the new President took office in March, so there wasn't very much time, but nonetheless the Senate acted and confirmed the nominee, and, in kind of an interesting twist of fate, the nominee turned down the post.  When Ward Hunt was nominated by Ulysses Grant in December of 1872--again, just a couple of months before the next President would come in--the Senate acted.  Let's take a look at William The nominee from President Rutherford Hayes was also nominated in December of that year, just months before the new President would come in, but nevertheless the Senate acted.  In all three cases, they confirmed the nominee within that short period of time. They debated. They vetted. They acted. They fulfilled their responsibility under the  Now there is another group of nominees in an election year where the vacancy occurred before the election, but the nominee was nominated after the election, and there are four in that group. We have President John Quincy Adams, who nominated John The day he nominated him was in December of 1828--again, just a few months before the new President would take office--and in that case, it was proceeded to be acted on by the The Senate chose to postpone the action, but they acted. They took a vote. They decided.  There was Jeremiah Black, the nominee, in February 1861. There was a motion to proceed. The Senate voted, and they rejected it.  Then we have a nominee from Abraham Lincoln in 1864, and that nomination was confirmed.  Finally, under President Dwight Eisenhower, there was William Brennan, and that nomination was confirmed as well.  In all of these cases, even though the nomination occurred after the election and there was little time, the Senate acted.  There is a set of nine more nominations that occurred in an election year, and these are cases where both the vacancy occurred before the election and the nomination occurred before the election.  Nominee William Johnson under Thomas Final result: The Senate acted. They confirmed.  Edward King under President John The Senate acted. They rejected that nomination, but they acted. They tabled it.  Edward Bradford under Millard They proceeded to again reject the nomination, but the Senate acted.  Melville Fuller--nominee under Grover Cleveland--was confirmed. And realize this was in May of that year.  George Shiras under Benjamin He was confirmed. That happened in July that the nomination occurred.  Brandeis under Woodrow He was nominated in  John Clarke, also Under Woodrow Nominated in  All of these were before the election in a parallel case to the situation with Justice Scalia passing away and a nomination in the election year.  Benjamin Cardozo was nominated by Herbert He was confirmed.  So there we have 16 cases--actually, I have only mentioned 15 so far--15 cases in our history in an election year, and in each and every case, the Senate acted--in each and every case except for the tragedy, the desecration of the Senate process that occurred last year.  Merrick Garland was nominated by Barack Obama in No action. The first no action in U.history. The first stolen seat in U.history.  Let's understand that this is politics out of control when Senators would ignore their oath of office, would proceed to engage in a Court-packing scheme and steal a Supreme Court seat. This is politics completely unhinged. This is driven by the dark money of the Koch brothers. This is the powerful, behind-the-scenes puppet master telling the Senate what to do because they cannot afford to have a Justice who hadn't been appropriately vetted by conservative think tanks to make sure how they will vote on Citizens United possibly get on the Supreme Nobody knew how Merrick Garland would vote on Citizens On the Democratic side, we worried that he might sustain it. On the Republican side, they worried that he might strike it down and be a ``we the people'' But instead of engaging in responsible Senate action required by our oath of office, for the first time in U.history, the majority, driven by a powerful special interest, the Koch brothers, decided to steal the seat.  So that is the setting in which next week's debate will occur. We have heard some very self-righteous words coming from the majority side saying: Look how qualified he is. How could you possibly say there is anything wrong with this nomination?  Well, I asked my fellow colleagues to realize the reality of what they are engaged in, that they had a responsibility and that every Senate majority in U.history exercised that responsibility until last year. And it corresponds to this enormous growth of dark, secret money under Citizens United entering our campaigns. It corresponds to the threat that the Koch brothers made in January of 2015 that they were going to spend nearly $1 billion in the 2016 election.  One of our Republican colleagues said he thought the Senate should do their job. He thought we should hold a debate, we should hold a vote. And there was a tremendous pressure brought to bear on that colleague from the suppliers of this dark money, and then 3 days later he changed his position.  This is a corruption of the very foundation of our democracy, and that is why there is only one legitimate nominee who President Trump should put forward to end this act of theft, to honor the integrity of the responsibility of the Senate, and that is Merrick We don't know where he stands on lots of issues. He has been a judge who came right down the middle. He has been a judge whom everybody respected. He wasn't from the extreme. But the process of stealing the seat was to get a judge whom everyone knew where he stood, because they wanted to make sure that he would sustain Citizens United, that he would take the corporate side against the consumer time after time after time. This is why there is a tragedy unfolding right now. I urge the American people to pay attention because the very foundation of our democracy, of the integrity of our institutions are being shattered, degraded, and destroyed right before our eyes.[[Page S2078]]  Those who care about the Constitution, those who care about the integrity of the Senate doing its job under its oath, those who care about the integrity of the Court must stand up and say no to this effort to pack the court.  One of the arguments colleagues made, not knowing the history of the United States, was that there just wasn't time. There was just not enough time to consider a nominee. So here is a little bit of information regarding time. Since the 1980s, every person appointed to the Supreme Court has been given a prompt hearing and a vote within 100 days. Since 1975, the average is 67 days.  So to those who said that this seat opened up in January and there wasn't time left to have the Senate exercise its responsibility, we can see that they were just presenting a falsehood, that there was plenty of time for the Senate to exercise its responsibility. To those who said that the nomination didn't come until March, there was still 10 months left. So from the time that Merrick Garland was nominated, 293 days were left in the administration.  For Kagan, consideration took 88 days; for Sotomayor, 67; for Alito, 83; for Roberts, 63; for Breyer, 74; and for Ginsberg, 51. Do we hear any numbers equivalent to 293 days?  Let's look at Thomas, 69 days, Kennedy at 65, Scalia himself at 85, Rehnquist at 89, and O'Connor at 33. They all fall into the same pattern of a couple of months for the paperwork to be done, the investigation to be completed, and the committee to hold hearings and to act. But there is Garland, with 293 days, and the Senate failing to act.  This simply reinforces the pretense put forward that there wasn't enough time, or that there was a tradition of not considering a nominee for a seat that became available in an election year, because it has happened 15 times previously in our history, and in all 15 times the Senate acted--every single one. So every argument put forward was phony, was wrong, and was based on falsehood. It was driven by dark money puppeteers of this Chamber wanting to make sure they could keep open their Citizens United money corrupting American campaigns and debasing our democratic  So to everyone who cares about the integrity of the Senate and the integrity of the Court, let this Senate know that they must return to respecting this institution and to respecting the That means Merrick Garland must be the nominee until the Senate has acted on him, and the nominee before us must be rejected.

1181,topic-id,904,"Mr.President, last week the Senate watched the House and the American people watched the House because the House was on the verge of taking away access to healthcare for 24 million Then last Thursday, a week ago from today, the House said: We are going to postpone that vote. We are not sure we have the votes to take healthcare away from 24 million Americans, but maybe we will vote tomorrow,  That was 6 days ago. Friday came, and the House said: No, we are not going to do that vote today because we don't have the votes.  Why didn't they have the votes? Because across the country, millions of Americans said that taking away healthcare is the wrong thing to do--to take away healthcare from Medicaid expansion, the Oregon Health Plan; to take away healthcare by restricting standard Medicaid as it existed before ACA; to take away the healthcare bill of rights that people so much appreciated; to undermine the ability of low-income working families to buy policies with significant subsidies on the exchange--all of that.  The House set it aside. I thought that was tremendous because this week, we are not going to have a diabolical bill destroying healthcare here on the floor of the But the majority party decided: No, we can't go a week without destroying healthcare, so we are going to put up this Congressional Review Act that would take healthcare away from 5 million mostly low-income women who gain access to healthcare through Planned We won't bring up on the floor the bill that failed in the House for 24 million Americans; no, we will just focus on 5 million mostly low-income women and take away their healthcare.  That is what this vote is about right now, later today. Clearly this attack on healthcare for women across America is wrong, just as it was wrong to try to destroy healthcare for 24 million It is an attack on women's right to choose what to do with their own bodies. It is an attack on the basic decency and compassion of the American people.  Since 1970, the title X family planning provider network has been dedicated to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and critical health services, such as screenings for breast and prostate cancer and sexually transmitted diseases.  Just in 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services, including Pap tests and breast exams and birth control and HIV testing, to more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers across the country. That is a huge impact on the health of the individuals served through title  In 2010, title X services prevented 87,000 preterm or low birth weight births. I can tell you, when my wife Mary was carrying each of our two[[Page S2131]]children, I so much hoped that we would not have a complication that would result in a low birth weight birth or a preterm birth in which the child might not even survive. So failing to provide that care is really setting back not just the health of thousands of babies but maybe affecting whether they live or die.  Title X services prevented 2,000 cases of cervical cancer. That is a big deal, cervical cancer, and it is a good deed to have title X services preventing it.  For 40 percent of women in America, their visit to a title X family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive annually.  So let's be honest about what repealing this rule means. It means family planning providers can be discriminated against by States that want to withhold Federal funding from family planning providers for reasons other than their ability to offer family planning services. It means less access to quality care and less access to affordable care.  By overriding this regulation, Republicans empower States to pick and choose who provides services on a criteria that has nothing to do with the quality of care patients receive. States have done this in the past, and it resulted in dramatically fewer women accessing critical family planning and healthcare services.  We know what this is about. It is about any Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides care and resources to 5 million women every year. They have been doing it for 100 years. And they are the target. But what has been their mission? Their mission has been to provide easy and affordable access to address reproductive health and enable women to make their own decisions about their healthcare. But now, thanks to this Congressional Review Act proposal before us, that principle is under attack, that principle of easy and affordable access to women's healthcare and women's control over healthcare choices, to keep the politicians out of their choices. This resolution is about putting the politician in charge of the individual healthcare decisions of women in America, and that is just wrong.  I encourage my colleagues to take a close look at this. You were spared having to vote on eliminating healthcare for 24 million Americans, but now you are required today to vote on eliminating healthcare for 5 million women--mostly low-income women--in Are you going to attack the healthcare of those women? Are you going to injure the babies they are carrying? There will be more low birth weight and preterm babies. That is the wrong thing to do.  Vote no.

1224,topic-id,952,"Mr.President, I appreciate the remarks, as well as the working together with the Senator from Montana as we tried to make certain that a program that is so valuable to veterans across the country--in my case particularly, veterans who live in rural America, in Kansas--to make certain that veterans can attain the care they have earned and the care they deserve.  We had a scandal at the VA in which many tragic things happened, and Congress came together at that time and passed the Choice What that law basically has given our veterans is, if they live more than 40 miles from a VA facility--in other words, if they live a long distance from access to care--they can, at their choice, have that care at home: hometown hospital, hometown physician, pharmacy, physical therapy. They can see a provider in their hometown.  In so many instances in Kansas--in fact, I have mentioned this before on the Senate floor. The House district I represented as a Congressman is larger than the State of Illinois, and there is no VA hospital in that congressional district. So veterans not having to travel 2, 3, 4, 5 hours to Denver or to Wichita or to Amarillo is of such value to our veterans, particularly those who have a disability or are aging. What we did in the passage of Choice was so useful to so many veterans.  The other part of that was that if you couldn't get the care you needed within 30 days at the VA, you could then attain your care at home. Again, with the backlog that was occurring at the VA, the lack of providers, this became important to another set of veterans who, because of their health condition, couldn't afford to wait that long to see a physician, to have surgery.  This is important legislation. If you are somebody who cares about veterans, you need to be in favor of this Choice If you are someone who cares about particularly rural or veterans who need timely care, you especially ought to be supportive of  The challenge we have is that the Choice Act is expiring. It expires August 7, and it needs to be extended. There are dollars available in the program. Mandatory spending is available to pay for the services to a later date.  As the Senator from Montana indicated, there are a number of provisions that haven't worked very well in Choice because of the bureaucratic nature of the program, the way the program has been established. One of those that are most important is that you have veterans on one side who need the care and choose Choice, but you also need a willing provider. The local hospital, the local physician needs to be willing to provide that care. I have never known a provider who was not honored to provide care to a veteran, but the challenge in many instances becomes whether that provider, that doctor or hospital gets reimbursed, gets paid.  This legislation has a number of reforms, but in my view, one of the most critical and most important is to make the VA the payer, to make the VA be the entity that writes out the check to pay the hospital bill, to pay the physician for the services provided.  So this is another reform that improves really on both sides. It eliminates some of the bureaucracy that a veteran goes through and the number of times a veteran may receive a notice that he or she owes money that should be paid by the Choice Program, and it also encourages--by paying them--the physician or the hospital to provide the service. These are important reforms, important changes in the Choice Act that are worthy of our support.  What is transpiring here are a couple of reforms to the Choice Program and its extension to a later date, until the money expires, so the Choice Program can continue, and Congress can now take that time to determine what we want to do with the Choice Program into the future after that point in time. I appreciate the way in which this legislation has worked.  Often I get asked whether there is any hope that Congress can work together, that Republicans and Democrats can solve problems. This is an example of where that is taking place today, by the care and concern we all have for our veterans and the good will that exists by those who serve in Congress to make sure that good things happen for our military men and women who are now veterans.  I regret that the chairman of the Veterans' Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Mr.Isakson, is unable to be with us, but, as the Senator from Montana indicated, he is fully supportive of this legislation. In fact, he is an original sponsor of the legislation.  I add my voice and ask my colleagues to agree to the unanimous consent resolution, that this legislation be passed. It will be another step in solving problems and caring for those who served our  Yesterday, I was at the Arlington National Cemetery--a reminder of the debt we owe to so many people.

We want to make sure that good things continue to happen. We want to improve the quality of service, get the problems out of the Choice Program, and make sure those who are so deserving of quality care actually receive it.

1003,topic-id,3311,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor this evening in celebration of an important milestone, but speaking about it actually presents a little bit of a challenge. In our current environment, how do you give a statement about a Secretary of State, a Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a Russian Ambassador, and an exchange of millions of dollars without making sensational headlines? Well, my answer to that is you tell the story of Alaska and the Treaty of Cession that brought Alaska into our Nation on March 30, 1867, exactly 150 years ago tomorrow.  If we are going to be fair, this story actually begins years before 1867. The United States and Russia had been in discussions over Russia's territorial claims since 1856, but the domestic turmoil and the Civil War in the United States stymied progress. So it wasn't until March 11, 1867, when Edouard de Stoeckl, Russia's Foreign Minister to the United States, met with then-Secretary of State William Seward that discussions really began in earnest.  From that time on, things really picked up speed. Just a few weeks later, on March 29, 1867--150 years ago today--Stoeckl received a cable from Czar Alexander II, approving a deal--a deal that would transfer Russia's interests in North America to the United In my office, I actually have a copy, a replica of the deal that was written, along with the note for $7.2 million. That was the deal, but closing it in time was far from certain.  With work in this Congress rapidly wrapping up ahead of its April adjournment--can you imagine that, actually having an adjournment around this body in April? But that was the way it was 150 years ago. There was little time to complete an agreement and see it ratified, but Secretary Seward was determined, and despite some rather lackluster interest from President Andrew Johnson, he pressed forward with this.  When Ambassador Stoeckl received the cable, he went to Seward's house on Lafayette Square to deliver the news to him. According to the National Archives, Mr.Stoeckl said: ``Tomorrow, if you like, I will come to the department, and we can enter upon the treaty.'' To which Seward replied: ``Why wait until tomorrow, Mr.Stoeckl? Let us make the treaty tonight.''  Secretary Seward was not merely a determined man; he was really a very canny man--canny because before he met Ambassador Stoeckl, he consulted with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who at the time was Charles Sumner of He did this to ensure smooth action by the U.Senate in approving a treaty. In other words--and this is a lesson that all good members of the executive branch should perhaps take to heart--the Secretary consulted with the Congress before taking action.  Conveniently, Senator Sumner and Secretary Seward lived on opposite sides of Lafayette Square from each other, and, according to the National Archives, they were able to meet at Secretary Seward's home. While Senator Sumner made no commitments about the passage of the treaty, he did send a note to Secretary Seward later that evening saying that following its adjournment at noon on Saturday, March 30, ``the Senate would be glad to proceed at once with Executive business'' and consider the treaty. With that, Ambassador Stoeckl and Secretary Seward went to work, crafting the treaty that night and long into the morning, finally putting their signatures to it at 4 a.m. on Saturday, March 30, 1867.  By 10 a.m. that same day, Secretary Seward had met with the Cabinet and with President Johnson to execute a proclamation calling the Senate into special session on Monday, April 1.  It was in Senator Sumner's famous speech to the Senate that day that the word ``Alaska'' was first officially used to describe the new territory. The word ``Alaska'' is Aleut in origin. Traditionally translated as ``mainland,'' it literally means, ``the object toward which the action of the sea is directed.''  It is important that I pause in reciting how Alaska came into the United States, first as a territory and later as a full member of our Union, by recognizing that while Western nations made deals about who ``owned'' the lands and the waters of Alaska, a diverse and vibrant Native people had already lived there for at least 14,000 years. While explorers, scientists, trappers, and settlers had come to Alaska from all over the world, the vast majority of our population were Alaska  Thankfully, after years of wrongful and misguided policies of assimilation, we in Congress now appreciate the incredible history and cultures of Alaska's indigenous peoples and have worked diligently to fulfill our trust responsibilities to them. Today, major landmarks like Denali, which is the highest mountain in North America, are again known by their rightful Native names. Today, Tribes are empowered to provide healthcare and other services to their people, and Federal agencies are required to consult with Alaskan Native Tribes on issues that impact their daily lives.  While we can all wrestle with the inherent challenge created for many by words like ``purchase'' and recognize[[Page S2117]]historical injustice, we must also look at the moment through the eyes of those who played a part--to see the opportunity as they did--so that we may capture it to better inform our future.  Senator Sumner's words remind us that what he, Secretary Seward, and others saw then was a foundation for opportunity, which continues in Alaska to this day. For example, in his remarks, Senator Sumner referenced a communication from the legislature of the Washington Territory to President Andrew Johnson in 1866. He said:       Your memorialists, the Legislative Assembly of Washington      Territory, beg leave to show that abundance of codfish,      halibut, and salmon of excellent quality have been found      along the shores of the Russian possessions. Your      memorialists respectfully request your Excellency to obtain      such rights and privileges of the Government of Russia as      will enable our fishing vessels to visit the ports and      harbors of its possessions to the end that fuel, water, and      provisions may be easily obtained, that our sick and disabled      fishermen may obtain sanitary assistance, together with the      privilege of curing fish and repairing vessels in need of      repair.  Long before my advocacy for Alaska's fisheries here in the United States Senate, long before my warnings about the dangers of genetically modified seafood, Washington and Alaska had a strong connection that was built on the bounty of our oceans. The economic importance of Alaska's fisheries was a prime consideration in America's acquisition of Alaska even then. It was a critical part of our effort to attain Statehood some 50-plus years ago. And today, it has grown into a fundamental element of the Pacific Northwest's economy.  Alaska's seafood industry now creates an estimated 118,000 jobs, $5.8 billion in annual income, and $14.6 billion in economic output nationally. We feed America, and we feed the world, with everything from our cod and our crab to our halibut and our salmon. Alaska's seafood exports alone would rank sixth compared to all other seafood-producing nations--not States, but nations.  Yet fisheries were but a small part of the justification Senator Sumner offered his colleagues at the time. The prime consideration is one that today remains unappreciated by most Senator Sumner stated the following:       The projection of maps is not always calculated to present      an accurate idea of distances. From measurement on a globe it      appears that a voyage from San Francisco to Hong Kong by the      common way of the Sandwich islands, is 7,140 miles, but by      way of the Aleutian islands it is only 6,060 miles, being a      saving of more than one thousand miles, with the enormous      additional advantage of being obliged to carry much less      coal. Of course a voyage from Sitka, or from Puget sound, the      terminus of the North Pacific railroad, would be shorter      still. . . . To unite the east of Asia with the west of      America is the aspiration of commerce now as when the English      navigator recorded his voyage.  Thus said Senator The cession of Alaska secured the Pacific trade route with Asia for And today, that great circle route represents the path that thousands of vessels annually take from ports along the west coast of the United States to Asia and back again. Chances are that the products created through the hard work of Americans in the middle of our country transit through Alaskan waters on their way to  Beyond the economic linkages, Alaska's geography has long been an asset recognized not just by our domestic strategic institutions but also by our enemies. While the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is a day that will live in infamy, the Japanese campaign in the Aleutians has been called the Forgotten Six months after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese bombed Dutch Harbor and occupied Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Alaska Natives were captured and sent to On May 11, 1943, the United States moved to retake Attu, landing 11,000 troops on the island. Some 1,000 Americans and more than 2,000 Japanese lost their lives in the fighting--the only land battle on American soil during World War  The Japanese attacked the Aleutians for the same reason that Senator Sumner supported the purchase of Alaska--for control of the Pacific transportation routes.  Many historians believe Japanese Admiral Yamamoto launched the attack to protect his nation's northern flank. The United States fought to regain those islands for the very same reason.  Brigadier General William ``Billy'' Mitchell--often called the ``father of the Air Force''--told Congress back in 1935:       I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will      hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic      place in the world.  Most of us in Alaska think that Billy Mitchell was correct.  Just as Alaska straddles the great circle route across the Pacific, it sits at the center of the air crossroads of the world. Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage sits halfway between Tokyo and New York City and less than 9\1/2\ hours by air from 90 percent of the industrialized world.  Think about that. Oftentimes we think about Alaska as so remote and so far away, but when you look at that globe and you look at Alaska's geographic position, we are in the center.  The airport is 2 in the United States for landed cargo weight and 6 in the world for cargo throughput. In 2012, 71 percent of all Asia-bound air cargo from the United States and 82 percent of all U.S.-bound air cargo from Asia transited through it.  It is no exaggeration to say that the significance of Alaska to the airborne and maritime trade of the United States likely exceeds even the treaty's biggest boosters' dreams back in 1867.  Alaska's strategic significance is now more important than ever. Our natural resources have provided energy and minerals for our Nation for decades--from the oil on our North Slope to our gold, silver, copper, and other metals. We are a storehouse of just about everything that you can think of and everything that you need in modern society.  We are blessed with an abundance of natural resources. We have committed to harnessing them responsibly. As long as there is an understanding of that here in Washington, DC, we will continue to produce every type of energy and many types of minerals for the good of our  Alaska also remains key to our Nation's defense. North Korea's consistent disregard for international norms and their aggressive attempts to acquire ballistic nuclear capabilities threaten our national security. The investments that we must continue to make in Alaska's missile defense infrastructure are fundamental to our national security interests.  Thanks to my colleagues here in the Senate and the Pentagon's continued recognition of Alaska's strategic importance, we continue to leverage our strategic location for America's national security. The installation of the long-range discrimination radar at Clear, the stationing of F-35s at Eielson, and the continued support for the 425th at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson--or JBER, as we call it--are just some of the critical investments we are making and must continue to make in  Understanding the opportunity of Alaska also means understanding the geography and the environment of our In preparing for this speech, I was struck by a latter part of the communication from the Washington Territorial Legislature to President Andrew Johnson in 1866. It stated:       Your memorialists finally pray your Excellency to supply      such ships as may be spared from the Pacific Naval Fleet in      exploring and surveying the fishing banks known to navigators      to exist along the Pacific Coast from the Cortes Banks to the      Bering Straits, and as in duty bound, your memorialists will      ever pray.  I would be remiss if I didn't note that--historical language aside--this request reads as if it could have been submitted to the Budget Committee by the current delegations from Alaska and  As we prepare to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of Cession tomorrow, our sesquicentennial, it is important to remind ourselves just how little has changed in our understanding of Alaska--understanding where it is, how far we have come, and how far we have yet to go when it comes to mapping and to charting.  In 2015, a couple of years ago, I had the honor of attending a celebration back home. It was an event where we celebrated a landmark event--that 57 percent of our land in the State had finally been mapped. That is how young a State Alaska really is. Recognizing that we just do not have accurate mapping in the State, it kind of struck me. For what else do we celebrate 50 percent of completion of anything, except[[Page S2118]]for us? We were making some progress, and it was worthy of celebration.  As bad as our basic mapping is, the situation is worse offshore in our waters, in the same places where the Washington Territorial Legislature asked for assistance back in 1866.  So 150 years ago, we were asking for assistance with the charting, but after 150 years, just 2.5 percent of the U.Arctic has been surveyed to modern standards. Just 2.5 percent of the U.Arctic has been surveyed to modern standards. Some 91 percent of the U.Arctic has either not been surveyed at all or relies on lead line readings, many of which were taken prior to the Treaty of Cession in 1867.  We talked to the Coast Guard and continue to hear stories about Captain Cook's voyage up to the north. It was actually a voyage on which a relative of mine, John Gore, was with Captain Cook, and they literally would put lead lines over the side of the ship, drop them down, and then recorded the readings.  Again, 91 percent of the U.Arctic has either not been surveyed or was surveyed with lead lines, and we are still relying on this data.  The U.has been chairing the Arctic Council now for 2 years. As we wrap up our term at the Arctic Council, I fear that we have accomplished much less than I, and many Alaskans, had hoped. It is Alaska that makes the United States an Arctic nation, a fact that was appreciated even at the time this body considered the appropriations for the treaty.  In a letter to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 1868, Joseph Wilson, who was the Commissioner of the General Land Office at the Department of the Interior, relayed the importance of the treaty to the committee, including this:       It gives her [the United States] also a hold upon the coast      of the great circumpolar ocean, the importance of which, as      yet imperfectly appreciated in the country, is awakening very      great interest in England, Denmark, Sweden, France,      and Germany are contemplating and organizing movements      looking to the exploration and occupancy of the      unappropriated northern regions of this continent--movements      which it becomes us to watch with jealousy, and promptly      circumvent.  Think about that statement 150 years ago.  Well, today, Russia, China, India, and a great number of other nations are looking to the Arctic as an emerging region of international significance, and they are seizing the opportunities that we continue to defer there.  I greatly appreciate my colleagues' attention to these issues, particularly the work of my colleague from Maine and the members of the Arctic Caucus, as we work to raise awareness and press administrations to put the same sort of energy and effort into the region that other nations are. They, too, see the importance of the Arctic to our national interest, as Commissioner Wilson did back in 1898.  After noting the importance of the Arctic attributes of Alaska, Commissioner Wilson went on to say:       Judged from this standpoint alone, and supposing the entire      country of Alaska to be a mere polar desert and utterly      uninhabitable, the developments of a very few years will show      that the acquisition of this territory at the stipulated      price is one of the most advantageous arrangements that our      diplomacy ever secured.  Think about those words: $7.2 million and the United States has  So when Commissioner Wilson said that in a few years it would ``show that the acquisition of this territory at the stipulated price is one of the most advantageous arrangements that our diplomacy ever secured,'' I would suggest, President Trump, this was a deal. We got a great deal with  Popular history may refer to ``Seward's folly'' or you hear that when you are reading it in history books, or it is also referred to as America's acquisition of ``Walrussia'' when describing the Treaty of Cession, but that ignores the broad support that the treaty actually had at the time. For example, the editors of the Charleston Daily News Miner recognized this on April 12, 1867:       As that territory is said to contain the highest mountain      in the world, he [Secretary Seward] has provided a fit      pinnacle from which the American Eagle can, when the days of      good feeling come back, spread itself over the immense      country that will then lie peacefully beneath the shadow of      its wings.  Indeed, there was opposition to the Treaty of Two Members of this body even voted against ratifying the treaty, but 37 did vote to ratify. And while the appropriations actually took another year, as appropriations often do, the treaty was largely viewed as a success.  From Alaska's fisheries to its minerals, from its oil and gas resources to its diverse and vibrant cultures, and from its position on important trade routes to its significance to our national security, Alaska's contribution to America has been and continues to be as big as our geography.  We are still a young I was actually born in the Territory of I am just the sixth Senator to have the honor of serving my State in this body.

694,topic-id,1789,"Mr.President, I am on the floor to speak in favor of the pending business before the Senate--to allow for Montenegro to join NATO as a new member. I have been a proponent of this move for a long time, having spent time in Montenegro and having chaired for a period of time the Europe and Regional Security Cooperation Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, now serving Senator Johnson as his ranking member.  I am convinced that NATO will be stronger if Montenegro joins. I am convinced that our alliance will be stronger if Montenegro joins. It is a small country with a very small military, but it occupies an incredibly important space on the world map. It is the only part of the Adriatic coast that breaks up the current NATO map, and it will provide a strengthening of our alliance in that region.  Montenegro is ready. It has made significant progress on internal reform, especially in the area of the rule of law and security sector reform. The Ministry of Defense has met all of the requirements for NATO membership. It is moving to modernize its military. It is moving to try to operationalize itself in a way that it can interact with both U.and European equipment. It is replacing its aircraft that previously had required Russian spare parts so that they are more compatible with European and American air equipment. There is still work that Montenegro needs to do, but now it can continue under the umbrella of the alliance.  I am very happy that we are taking an important step here to signal that NATO's open-door policy is still in practice. I think there was some doubt, frankly, and some concern, after years and years of Montenegro's desire to join amidst the interest from Georgia and prior to the crisis in Ukraine, that some of these transatlantic institutions were closing down. This is a sign that NATO is not only viable but is still open to those countries that want to join, that want to find additional safety and security under our umbrella. I am glad we are going to have a bipartisan vote here in favor of Montenegro's joining  I want to make a broader point about our future policy in the It was[[Page S2034]]not that long ago that it was a precondition, if you were a Member of Congress, to be an expert on the The United States was at war in the Balkans, as were Russia and our European allies. It was the hottest spot on the globe. Thanks to U.military might as well as diplomatic might, the Dayton Peace Accords brought peace and relative economic prosperity to a region of the globe that has been, frankly, at the center of almost every major conflict in and around Europe over the greater part of the last 100 years. It is a moment to celebrate this period of political and security stability in the Balkans and to remember that we should not take it for granted. There are still festering ethnic and nationalist tensions that play out every day in the We see them in small ways.  When I was there, a drone with a map of greater Albania dropped down into the middle of a football match between the Serbian national team and the Albanian national team, which was a deliberate attempt to inflame the It seemed like a small thing, but it resulted in the cancelation of a historic meeting between the Prime Minister of Albania and the Prime Minister of  Just recently, we have seen some breakdown in the progress Serbia and Kosovo had been making to try to resolve their differences, resulting ultimately, we hope--we believe--in the recognition of Kosovo's statehood by the Serbian Government, which is a reminder that bringing Montenegro into NATO is important for the alliance's sake, but it is also an important step in continuing to make investments in security in the  It is important for a second reason in that there is another player out there that is desperately trying to make the Balkans less stable, and that is For a very long time, Russia has had legitimate interests in the They have relations with the people of the Balkan nations, as well as with those governments, but today they have an interest in trying to destabilize that region, to create a crisis for Europe, to create a crisis for  As we all know, Russia fills vacuums of power better than almost any other player out there. Whether or not we like it, as Members of the Senate, there is an enormous vacuum in the world right now that is created by the withdrawal of Without a robust State Department, without coherent U.foreign policy, we are just not players in the world today like we were a year ago. Example A may be the Balkan region.  The Balkans require attention because there are these simmering potential conflicts, and the United States has been a force for good but in ways that most Americans probably do not even know. It required the constant attention from Vice President Biden, Secretary of State Kerry, and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland to make sure that the Balkans--in particular, the western Balkans--continued their move toward Europe and rejected offers from Russia for a different kind of alignment. Weekly big and small interventions allowed the Balkan nations to feel comfort in a future with Europe and with the United That intervention, that attention, has, frankly, just disappeared, and the Russians have filled that vacuum.  There was a coup attempt in You do not see a lot of coup attempts these days in countries in and around Europe, but there was an attempt to storm the Parliament--an attempt that has been connected to Russian nationals. Those Russian nationals, according to Montenegro, have connections directly with the Russian That has not been confirmed yet, but it is incredibly disturbing to know that Russian nationals were behind an attempted military coup inside  We have seen a much tighter joining of the leaders of the Republika Srpska and Russian interests and operatives in a move toward a referendum for independence in the Republika Srpska, which is a component of Bosnia and It looks suspiciously like the kind of independence referendums that have threatened to take place in parts of Ukraine and Luhansk and  There are reports that the same players who are trying to fund and operationalize independent referendums in Ukraine are also at work inside Serbia--players with connections back to the  There are reports of a massive increase in Russian media presence in the Balkans--more offers from Russian TV stations and radio stations to provide free content to cash-strapped Balkan media outlets.  There are over 100 different nonprofit organizations in Serbia alone, according to one report, that have financial connections back in and through  Russia is filling this vacuum in the It is trying to win friends and trying to create an instability that ultimately would land at the doorstep of NATO, at the doorstep of Europe, and at the doorstep of the United They are filling that vacuum because we do not have a presence there today.  Secretary Tillerson has no meaningful experience in the He has no Deputy and he has no Assistant Secretary for the When you pair that next to a proposal that Secretary Tillerson endorses cutting his budget by 40 percent, you will make America relatively feckless in that region because it is those funds that the administration is seeking to cut that are often our linkages to influence.  In Belgrade, our Ambassador has made enormous progress with a small amount of money for exchange programs. You look at people in powerful positions in Serbia today, and many of them are close to the United States because they have participated in State Department exchange programs. They have spent time here in the United States getting to know our country, maybe getting educated here, and they have gone back to Serbia to be part of the government in order to represent Serbian interests but with a connection to the United States and to the West that is important. Those exchange programs are basically eviscerated by a 40-percent cut. They will not exist any longer. It is a very small program, but it has not only gotten us important results in the Balkans, it has contributed to our ability to argue for stability and to argue for the calming of tensions because it gets doors opened for the United  Without anybody being on call for the State Department in the Balkans, without any funding in order to try to promote stability and economic connections between those countries, we cede ground to Russia every single day. Russia sees vacuums, and they fill them, and we have created them. We have created a vacuum globally, but we have created a specific vacuum in the It is filled in part by this movement to join Montenegro with  I do appreciate the fact that Secretary Tillerson, I believe, and Secretary Mattis have both recommended to this body that we take up this matter. I think that was important, and I applaud them for standing against the recommendations of the Russian Government and for the accession of Montenegro into NATO, but it is not enough.  I wanted to come to this floor--and I see my great friend and colleague from Ohio, who is ready to speak--to make the case as to why this is so important and to make the case that as Russia tries to view Montenegro as an opportunity to establish a Kaliningrad on the Mediterranean, we can prevent its happening with this vote and with the vote of our European allies to join Montenegro with NATO, but it is not enough. We have to remember that stability in the Balkans is nothing to be taken for granted. The next global crisis may come from a small act of tension between neighbors that spins out of control, in part because the United States is not paying attention and because Russian intervention in the region, which is bigger and broader now than ever before, has an interest not in stability but actually ultimately in instability.  I thank Leader McConnell for bringing this before the body. This is a chance for us to join together in supporting Montenegro as it joins Hopefully, there will be more opportunities for us to work together to make sure that this administration, to make sure that our country has a comprehensive policy to continue to build on the NATO peace accords and double down on the work we do to promote long-term stability and prosperity in the Balkan region.[[Page S2035]]  I yield the floor.

959,topic-id,1685,"Mr.President, I have a great deal of respect for my friend from Pennsylvania, as we have worked together on a number of issues, but forgive me if my blood boils when I hear my Republican friends talk about breaking precedent in this body when it comes to the consideration of Supreme Court nominees. Forgive me if I get a little angry when I hear those on the other side of the aisle talk about Democrats' using exceptional measures, in their opinion, in order to oppose a Justice for the Supreme Come on. Everybody knows what happened here last year. The Republican majority decided to deny the President of the United States--at the time, Barack Obama--the ability under the U.Constitution to nominate a Justice to the Supreme Court, not because of anything having to do with the merits of the nominee, Merrick Garland, but simply because the President was a Everybody knows that is what happened. Everyone knows that precedent was broken and that comity was broken here in the Senate when the Republican majority decided not just to deny a vote on this floor but not to even give the courtesy of a meeting, of a hearing to Merrick Garland despite the fact that he was unquestionably qualified for that position.  It is a fiction to suggest that there is some strategy amongst Democrats on this nomination. We are all making up our minds individually. I decided yesterday that I was not going to support[[Page S2089]]Judge Gorsuch because I think he is likely going to side on behalf of corporations and special interests instead of my constituents and bring his politics to the bench in a way that I do not think squares with the people whom I represent. Yes, I am going to use my ability to vote on the floor of the Senate in order to stop his nomination.  I understand Republicans may not be happy about my decision and the decisions of others on this side of the aisle, but let's have a discussion about the merits of Judge Gorsuch, not the question of which side is breaking precedent because everybody remembers what happened to Merrick Nobody has forgotten that. This is not some quid pro quo, this is not some tit for tat, but to come down and pretend as if 2016 did not happen.  Mr.President, I would like to speak for a moment about a potential CRA--another CRA--that is perhaps coming to the floor this week or next week. It is one that would take away the ability of States to try to do something about the retirement crisis that is enveloping this country.  I speak as one of the youngest Members of this Chamber, and it scares me to death to think that half of Americans who are in their working years have no money saved for retirement today before a qualification for Social Security or Even worse, a study that I looked at the other day suggested that 58 percent of Americans who are working have not even done the calculations as to how much money they will need in order to retire.  There is a retirement crisis in this country, and you can understand why, as wages have been essentially flat for tens of millions of Americans and employers have largely left the space of defined benefit plans. And there is just no money to save when you have to cobble together your paycheck to meet your budget every week and when your employer is not putting in the kind of plan he used to and the kind of contribution he used to. So you can understand why Americans are in this position.  State governments--those laboratories of experiments that I hear a lot of my friends talk about--have come up with an idea. There are 55 million working Americans who do not have a way to save for retirement out of their regular paychecks, meaning their employers are not offering them any way to set aside a portion of their incomes in order to save.  So that is one number--55 million Here is another: In my State, 44 percent of workers do not have access to retirement plans through their employers. That is about 600,000 people in Half of my State does not have access, when they show up to work, to retirement savings plans through their employers. Yet we know that employees who have access to a payroll deduction are 15 times more likely to save for retirement--not twice as likely, not 5 times as likely, but 15 times more likely.  It stands to reason that State legislatures would step in and say: OK, for employers who are not offering plans, we are going to give employees the ability to set aside a small portion of their earnings in a privately run plan that is sponsored through the State governments.  If the employer is not going to do it, then there is really no one else other than the State governments. In a handful of occasions, the States of decided to step in and offer this option to employees.  By the way, as far as I understand, it is not traditionally a State-run plan; it is a privately run plan. It is just that the State is acting as the conduit to get employees linked with private plans and to allow for a small portion of their paychecks to be set aside. Employees are 15 times more likely to save if they have access to that payroll deduction.  This is a pretty run-of-the-mill, typical State intervention in order to try to solve a problem that is real for State legislators. So it is a mystery to me as to why we would try to take that ability away from  What we are doing is taking away an ERISA exemption for States relative to these plans. Why that is important is that ERISA is all about the employer-employee relationship. There are important responsibilities that flow from employers to employees when they are engaging in a retirement plan that is offered through the workplace. But the State is not the employer of this individual; the State is simply acting as a conduit to get that employee into a private sector plan. So the ERISA rules simply do not work. They are a mismatch for this State innovation. The Federal Government, through regulation, has recognized that.  Importantly, in my State of Connecticut, which does have one of these plans, we provide ERISA-like protections, so the protections you get in ERISA, you get through this State innovation. It is just that the way in which the Federal Government normally requires it does not make sense because the State in this case is just the conduit, not the employer.  This sort of seems like a pretty run-of-the-mill exercise of State innovative power, a fairly run-of-the-mill exercise of Federal regulatory authority to allow for this innovation to happen, and it is hard to understand why we are taking it away, why we are taking this ability away from 600,000 Connecticut residents who, frankly, will not have access to easy retirement savings without it.  We have known that set-asides in your paycheck work. That is why we have provided incentives for employers to do it. But not every employer does it. Why? Because if you are a small employer, it just may not make sense administratively to establish one of these plans. So States have decided to offer it themselves.  I know that the retirement industry may not love this idea because it might not make the same fees on these plans as it would if the plans were offered through the employer, but, frankly, these hundreds of thousands of people in my State are not going to be the retirement companies' customers without this innovation. It is not like these State-backed plans are stealing business from the private retirement plans. They were never going to be customers without their ability to put aside a little bit of money.  We have a retirement crisis in this country right now, and this is an innovative way to solve it. I know this is not yet scheduled for a vote, a Congressional Review Act vote that would take away the ability of States to offer these plans in a meaningful way, and I really hope we think twice about it. It sort of feels like we are just inventing CRAs to bring before the Senate and the We are kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel, and this one just does not make sense. This does not make sense.  Let States that want to pass this innovation, that want to give their constituents, their citizens the ability to save through payroll deductions, through payroll withholding, the ability to do that. Do not do the bidding of the big retirement providers, who may think they are going to make more money if the CRA passes, but in reality these folks were probably never their customers. Let States move forward with this innovation. Let the people of Connecticut and California see how it works so that maybe other States can learn from our experience.  I hope we can come to some agreement to leave this innovation alone and move on to some other important issue here and not risk doing something that is, frankly, going to exacerbate the retirement crisis that exists in this country. Republicans and Democrats should be trying to work together on this question of giving people more access to retirement plans.  For all of the things that we fight over, whether it be the healthcare law or whether it be a tax cut bill or a budget, this just seems like one of these issues in which we should set this CRA aside with respect to State innovations and try to find a way to find some common ground. I hope that is where we will head. It would really matter to my constituents in Connecticut, who are expecting to receive the benefit of this newfound access to retirement.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgS2055-6.txt,1837,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S.J. RES. 34, PROVIDING FOR",2017.0,29.0,March
942,topic-id,916,"Mr.President, I am deeply frustrated that Republicans, in one of their first actions following their and President Trump's disastrous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, have decided to bring to the floor yet another CRA that would hurt workers, hurt the middle class, and hurt our economy.  Last week, millions of families sent a very clear message to President Trump and Republicans: Enough with the attempts to turn back the clock on progress for working families.  Clearly, President Trump and Republicans are not getting the message because, today, in what can only be described as a truly shameless giveaway to Wall Street, Republicans are poised to roll back a rule that would, simply, allow cities to help small businesses provide their workers access to easy, affordable, and high-quality retirement savings programs.  Before I continue, I want to reiterate what is at stake if Republicans roll back this rule. If Republicans pass this anti-worker resolution that is on the floor today, over 2 million workers in Philadelphia, in New York City, and in[[Page S2076]]Seattle--in my home State of Washington--will lose the opportunity to access a retirement savings program.  I expect my Republican colleagues to make several claims as to why they are pushing to repeal this rule, but I want to be very clear that this is a deliberate attempt by Republicans to deny millions of workers the opportunity to save for retirement just to ensure that Wall Street remains in charge of our retirement system and can continue to write its own rules.  The 2 million workers who are at risk today in these three cities are part of the nearly 55 million workers across the country, which include 2 million workers in my home State of Washington, who do not have access to a workplace retirement plan through their employers. That is about one-third of all of the workers in our country. These are workers--particularly low-income and young workers--who are putting in long hours, meeting all of their responsibilities, but who lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.  Because Congress has been unable to come together to address our retirement savings crisis, cities and States have now stepped up to help more workers save for their own retirements. These programs vary, but they all generally include several things.  First of all, they allow employers to automatically enroll workers while giving workers the opportunity to opt out. Several studies have made clear that, when workers are automatically enrolled, they are more likely to save simply because it is easier to save. We all want that, and that is a fact.  Secondly, these programs apply only to businesses that do not currently offer retirement plans, and they, in no way, limit an employer's ability to seek out and offer its own employer-sponsored plan.  Lastly, these programs are worker and business friendly. There is little paperwork required for workers to participate in the programs, and there are no added burdens to the small businesses. In fact, in these programs, employers are strictly required to serve only in an administrative capacity.  Last year, Democrats, in their working with the previous administration, pushed for guidance to provide certainty to cities and States that have launched their own retirement programs.  This guidance clarifies an existing safe harbor that allows employers to establish payroll deduction IRAs, which gives States the clarity that these programs will not be preempted by Federal retirement law while still retaining the protections under the Internal Revenue These retirement programs are safe; they are secure. This guidance merely provides flexibility to cities and States to move forward with these programs. Again, this guidance provides clarity for small businesses, which facilitate these programs for their employees, in that they may only act in an administrative capacity in operating these plans.  I think we all know what this repeal is truly about. President Trump is committed to doing everything he can to put the interests of Wall Street first. Unfortunately, with this action, Republicans in Congress are helping him do that.  It does not seem to matter if Republicans need to vote against policies they are on the record as having previously supported, like these retirement programs. Apparently, it does not matter if they need to vote to undermine our States' rights, as this resolution will do. It is becoming increasingly clear, without having a legislative agenda of their own, that Republicans are working to undo any and all rules and protections that had been put forth by the Obama administration.  It is not working. It is not leadership. It is not the kind of leadership our families deserve. After last week, I had hoped that President Trump and the Republicans would have dropped their extreme anti-worker agenda. Families nationwide are sending a clear message in marches and phone calls and letters and online and in their communities. They expect their representatives to be committed to working for them, and they are paying close attention--more than ever before--and are prepared to hold Members accountable.  This CRA is a critical vote. Families are watching. If you stand with working families, vote against this resolution. If you say you believe in States' rights, vote against this resolution.

1162,topic-id,1190,"Mr.President, this vote had to be held open in order to allow time for Vice President Pence to come down and break a tie.  My colleagues and I came to the floor weeks ago to make clear that this harmful legislation should not come to the floor. Republicans didn't listen to us, and they didn't listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women's access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable. We are not going to give up. We are going to keep holding them accountable, and we are going to keep making sure that women's voices are heard.  I want to thank all of my colleagues who have already come and will continue to come to the floor today to stand against this shameful, dangerous resolution.  The march that was held after President Trump was inaugurated was one of the most inspiring events I have ever had the opportunity to be a part of. Millions of people--men and women--marched in Seattle in my home State, here in Washington, DC, and in cities and towns in between and all across the world. They carried signs, they chanted, and they made it absolutely clear that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, people across the country do not want to go backward. Since then, millions of people have continued to speak up and stand up. And last Friday, by the way, was no different.  Republicans have been threatening for years now to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but it took just a few weeks for families nationwide to stand up and fight back and shut down a deeply harmful plan that would have taken healthcare away from tens of millions of people, spiked our premiums, targeted seniors for higher costs, and cut off access to critical services at Planned  I was so inspired by the countless people who bravely shared their personal stories about their health and their loved ones in order to make clear just how damaging--and even deadly--TrumpCare would have been. I am proud to say that women led the way and made it known, in no uncertain terms, that Republicans would be held fully accountable for the disastrous TrumpCare legislation.  And try as they might, last week, Republicans couldn't ignore them. This was an absolute, undeniable victory for women and families in this country.  But while TrumpCare was dealt a significant blow last week, it is clear the terrible ideas that underpin it live on now, today, in this Republican It is unprecedented that we are here, with the Vice President breaking a tie vote on an attack on women's health across this country.  We are here today, once again, because President Trump and Republicans in Congress are not getting the message. Today, continuing on their extreme, anti-women agenda, Senate Republicans are rushing now to roll back a rule that protects family planning providers from being discriminated against and denied Federal funding.  Let me explain a little bit about what family planning providers mean to our communities. Those providers that are part of the title X program--which has, by the way, bipartisan history--deliver critical healthcare services nationwide, and they are especially needed in our rural and our frontier areas.  In 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services--services like Pap tests and breast exams and birth control and HIV testing--to more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers. In my home State of Washington, tens of thousands of patients are able to receive care at these centers each year, and they often have nowhere else to turn for their healthcare. In fact, 40 percent of women who receive care at health centers funded by title X consider it to be their only source of healthcare.[[Page S2123]]  So taking resources away from these providers, which this resolution would do, would be cruel, and it would have the greatest impact on women and families who need it the most. It would undo a valuable effort by the Obama administration to ensure that healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide the services in question, not on ideology. In doing so, this resolution would make it even easier for States led by extreme politicians to deny family planning providers Federal dollars, not because of the quality of care that they get or provide or their value to the communities they serve, but based on whether the politicians in charge--the politicians in charge--agree that women should be able to exercise their constitutionally protected right to reproductive healthcare.  This is wrong. It is dangerous, and we cannot let this stand.  If Republicans think that millions of people who stood up last week have suddenly stopped paying attention, they are sorely mistaken. And if they think that Senate Democrats are not going to fight back, they have another thing coming. They can expect every single Democrat in the Senate--and I hope some Republicans who are concerned about losing healthcare providers in their States--to fight back against this resolution with everything they have.  This vote won by a tie vote, and the Vice President was the tie vote. It will take one Republican this afternoon on the final vote to say yes for the women in their State and States' rights to say no. That is all we are asking for the women of this country.  While I have the floor, I want to say we should all be aware there is more headed our way. In a matter of weeks, we all know that government funding is going to run out. Everybody understands this. I know that since they didn't get their way last week and they are pushing this resolution so hard today to the point where they bring the Vice President to break a tie, it is a safe bet that extreme Republicans are going to try to attach riders that try to take away Planned Parenthood funding in the spending bill for the rest of this year.  So I want to be very clear from the outset: That is a complete nonstarter. We have been here before. We have shown that we can win, and we are going to fight these efforts every step of the way.  So I urge people across the country to let their Senators know that this is not acceptable. Stand up for women and families and for their rights to take care of their own reproductive healthcare at the facility that provides for them in their own communities.  I urge my colleagues: Don't make the same mistake again. End the damaging political attacks on women, and stand with millions of women and men and families. They need us.  Thank you.

1168,topic-id,1475,"Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues who are here speaking out against this shameful resolution that is before us today that goes after women's rights and their opportunity to make their own healthcare decisions with their own provider.  I, too, want to echo the comments that were just made. I find it amazing that the Republicans have yielded back all of their time. They are not going to come out here and defend their vote; they are just going to take the vote.  In fact, it seems clear to me that President Trump is clearly focused on attacking women's healthcare--so much so that he sent his women's health adviser, Vice President Pence, here just moments ago to break a tie on this latest disgusting attack on women's healthcare. It is truly appalling.[[Page S2126]]  Women and men across the country are watching what is happening here today, watching what Republicans are trying to do, and they are paying attention.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Madam President, I wish today's resolution was the only shameful attack on women's health to talk about, but sadly that is not the case. So I do want to take a few minutes at this time to talk about another one that is very critical to women and families--not just today, but actually for years and years to come it will be happening, and that is the Supreme  Last week I announced I would be voting against Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court, and I will oppose a cloture motion ending debate. I did not reach that conclusion lightly. I consider my decisions about whether to support a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court to be among the most important and consequential choices I make as a But I made it in part because this is not a normal nomination.  This process really began about 12 months ago when Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick And because since President Trump entered office, he has shown complete disregard for the law, for our Constitution, for the well-being of families across the country, leaving me unable to trust that he is acting in our Nation's best interest, I am unable to support his choice for the Supreme  In addition to my deep concerns about this process and this administration, I also have strong concerns about this nominee specifically. Today, as Republicans appear to be rushing Judge Gorsuch's nomination through the Judiciary Committee as fast as they can, I want to lay out why putting Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court would be an attack on women's health, rights, and opportunity, one that has the potential to undo decades of progress we have made toward making sure women are equally able to participate in and contribute to our country.  The Trump administration has broken almost every one of its promises, but one it has certainly kept is its promise to do everything in its power to turn back the clock on women's health and women's rights. Extreme Republicans in Congress are doing the same and have more, apparently, in store. Right now, we are debating whether to undo a rule that prevents discrimination against family planning providers based on the kinds of services they provide to women. Congressional Republicans are already gearing up to attach riders to the coming budget bills in order to cut off access to critical services at Planned Parenthood for millions of patients in this country. There are similar attempts to undermine women's access to healthcare in cities and States nationwide.  More often than we would like, the Supreme Court is going to be the place of last resort for protecting women's hard-fought gains. The buck has to stop with the Supreme Court on women's health and rights.  I do not want Judge Neil Gorsuch anywhere near the bench. Time and again, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the extreme rightwing and against the tens of millions of women and men who believe that in this 21st century, women should be able to make their own choices about their own bodies.  Let me give a few examples. When the Tenth Circuit ruled in the case of Hobby Lobby v. Burwell that a women's boss--a woman's boss--could decide whether her insurance would include birth control, Judge Gorsuch didn't just agree, he thought the ruling should have gone further. That alone would be enough for me to oppose this nomination, but unfortunately there is more.  Judge Gorsuch has argued that birth control coverage included in the ACA as an essential part of a woman's healthcare--one that has now benefited 55 million women--is what he calls a ``clear burden'' on employers that would not long survive.  When it comes to Planned Parenthood, he has already weighed in on the side of defunding our Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare. What was his reasoning? Well, Judge Gorsuch thought that in light of completely discredited sting videos taken by extreme conservatives, women in the State of Utah should have a harder time accessing the care they need. Just this week, the makers of those false videos, by the way, got 15 felony charges. Women deserve independence and objectivity in a Supreme Court Justice, and that is clearly not it.  Attempts to control women's bodies aren't always about reproductive rights. Sure enough, Judge Gorsuch is on the wrong side here as well. He concurred in a ruling against a transgender woman who was denied regular access to hormone therapy while she was in prison. This ruling rejected the idea that under our Constitution, denying healthcare services is cruel and unusual punishment. Think about that. That is not the kind of judgment I want to see on the bench, and I think most families would agree.  I also want to be clear as well about what Judge Gorsuch's nomination could mean for a woman's constitutionally protected right to safe, legal abortion services under the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade, which was, by the way, reaffirmed just last summer by the In his nomination hearings, Judge Gorsuch wouldn't give a clear answer on whether he would uphold this ruling which has meant so much to so many women and families over the last four decades.  Judge Gorsuch has donated repeatedly to politicians who are dead-set on interfering with women's constitutionally protected healthcare decisions, and he has even made deeply inaccurate comparisons between abortion and assisted suicide.  I remember the days before Roe v. Wade very clearly. I heard and saw firsthand the stories of women faced with truly impossible choices during those times. Women from all across the country have shared deeply personal experiences because they know what it would mean to go backward. I know that millions of women who have already done so much to lead the resistance against this administration and its damaging, divisive agenda are going to fight this nomination as hard as they can. They know the Trump Presidency will be damaging enough for 4 years, but Judge Gorsuch's nomination could roll back progress for women over a lifetime. I am proud to stand with them and do everything I can to make sure they are heard loud and clear here in the Senate, and I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination in light of everything it would mean for women now and for generations to come. Next week is when we will vote on that.  Today here in the Senate, we just saw a historic moment. The Senate Republicans put forth a resolution that would allow States to deny funding to providers in their States who provide healthcare services for women--funding that is desperately needed. They got only 50 votes, and those in opposition got 50 votes, so they brought over the Vice President of the United States, and he broke that tie in order for us to be here to debate this resolution now. This vote will now occur, under the order, later this afternoon, and he will be brought back once again to deny women the healthcare choices they deserve to have. It is a sad day for the  I want my friends, colleagues, and the women who have stood up and have spoken out since the day after the election, marched here in Washington, DC, and across the country, to know that I stand with them. My voice will not be silenced. I will continue to fight back.  I will say one more time that it will take one more Republican on the other side this afternoon--one--to stand up and let their voice be heard and say that women should get access equally in their States for the healthcare they deserve.

1185,topic-id,864,"Mr.President, I have to say that this is a sad day for the I know many of us here today--certainly my Democratic colleagues--are truly appalled. Once[[Page S2132]]again, instead of working on the many pressing issues at hand, Republicans are continuing their tired, dangerous obsession with attacking women's health.  Once again, women's health is being used as a political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off access to vital healthcare services. Once again, millions of families across the country are watching Congress, wondering why there isn't just one more Republican who will stand up for them.  The Republicans just held a vote open for nearly an hour to force a vote that would allow politicians to discriminate against family planning providers. Of course, whenever they can't make a vote, when women's health is being attacked, whom do Senate Republicans call to break that tie in the Senate? Vice President Mike  We have actually seen this before. We all remember what happened in the nomination of Secretary DeVos, and we all know that enough is enough. This is shameful. This is wrong. It cannot stand.  Families have spoken time and again, and they have made it absolutely career that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, they do not want to go backward. But today, thanks to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, thanks to Vice President Pence, the Senate will hold a vote on whether critical healthcare services should be taken away from millions of women across the country.  Let's not forget, it hasn't even been a week since people nationwide completely rejected TrumpCare, that disastrous bill that would have undermined women's rights and healthcare in so many ways.  Now, here in the Senate today, we are about to vote on whether a young woman should be able to go to the provider that she trusts to get birth control; whether it is Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, or HIV testing, which should be more or less available to women across the country; whether healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide services or ideology; whether women are able to exercise their constitutionally protected rights to reproductive healthcare; and whether the Senate is going to turn back the clock today on women's health.  For me and for Democrats, and I know even for some Republicans, it is disappointing, deeply disappointing, that we are even having this vote today--a vote that was jammed through, with 48 Democrats and 2 Republicans voting no and Vice President Pence coming down to break the tie.  Put simply, rolling back this rule today will put at risk women's lives, like a constituent of mine from Tacoma, She wrote me a letter recently to tell me the many reasons this is so important to her.  When she was 20, she was uninsured. She had no other options. A family planning center was there for her. During a routine Pap test, her doctor discovered a precancerous condition in her cervix. That led to surgery, which saved her life and saved her fertility.  Without access to that provider, she would not have been able to get a regular Pap smear and checkup and most likely would have developed cervical cancer. She would not have been able to get pregnant, go on to have a daughter, become a community college counselor, and today, at the age of 65, be cancer-free.  I hope that some of my Republican colleagues are listening and that they think of women just like this, whose lives are healthier and have been saved because of the services of so many family planning centers. That is who I will be thinking about. That is what has always kept me going.  I urge people across the country right now to let Senators know that this vote today, this rule is not It is not acceptable. Make phone calls. Go on Tweet about it. Everything helps. Tell your Senator today that in about an hour, with their vote, to stand up for you, for your family, and for women across the country.  We need only one more Republican--one more--to join us. This vote that we are about to have in about an hour is dead even, on the razor's edge. Fifty Senators--48 Democrats and 2 Republicans--will vote to reject this harmful, disgusting resolution. We just need one more Republican to join us, to stand on the side of women and men and families, and put an end to this damaging political attack on women.  I am sure people will hear about this. I am going to be here on the floor. Many of my colleagues are going to be out here talking about it. People nationwide will have the opportunity to know exactly where every Republican stands on this.  I urge our Republican colleagues: Stop to think about what you are doing, taking away the ability of women in communities across our country to go to the provider they trust for the care that is most important to them, their families, and our country's future.

As a direct result of their choices today, extreme politicians in States across the country will have greater power to take away women's choices.  I think it speaks volumes that the vote to uphold this rule--which simply says family planning centers, where women can exercise their constitutionally protected rights, should not be[[Page S2138]]discriminated against--is bipartisan. But do you know what I think is most striking about this vote? The deafening silence from the group of almost entirely male Republican Senators who are voting today to make it harder for women to get the healthcare they need. Not one spoke today to justify this vote. Where are those Republican Senators? Why did they feel so entitled not just to interfere with women's healthcare decisions but to do so without explaining themselves? If they are ashamed of their votes, which they should be, they had ample opportunity to reconsider.  I came to the floor with my Democratic colleagues weeks ago to urge Republicans not to bring this damaging legislation to the floor. We asked for just one Republican vote today to prevent this attack on women's health. And women across the country, in Republican and Democratic States, called, emailed, tweeted, and organized to say that these restrictions on women's access to healthcare have no place in our country or in the 21st century. But what have these 50 Senate Republicans done? They refused to listen, and they refused to answer for their actions.  Frankly, women deserve better. The thing is, women know it. So today, as a woman, I am angry. As a mother and a grandmother, I am furious about what attacks like this mean for our daughters and our granddaughters, especially those who are struggling and disproportionately rely on family planning centers. But as a Senator, I am more confident than ever that Republicans who fail to listen to the women of this country do so at their own peril. I have had the chance to see how much impact women have when they call and march and organize and make their voices heard.

Republicans complained that premiums were skyrocketing, so they offer a bill that raises premiums. They complained that deductibles were too high, so they propose allowing insurance companies to charge more. They complained that too many people were losing their insurance, so they have embraced a plan that will take away health care from 24 million  This bill imposes a devastating age tax on older Americans and does next to nothing to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. It gives nearly $900 billion in tax cuts to the insurance companies and the wealthy, while refusing coverage for services as basic as hospitalization. It's simple: Americans will pay more and get less under this bill.  In New York, 2.7 million people will lose insurance and the state will lose $4.6 billion in Medicaid funding. Compounding those cuts is a cynical so-called deal several upstate Members made to secure their votes on this bill. Under the bill, New York State, and ONLY New York State, will no longer be allowed to ask counties to provide a portion of state Medicaid funding.  Don't be fooled--this is no deal at all for New York and will actually gut the State's Medicaid program, forcing hundreds of hospitals to close and rationing health care for millions of New  But my colleagues who have traded their vote for this provision have made an empty bargain. This provision is flatly unconstitutional and will never be enacted. They are giving away health insurance for millions of New Yorkers for an empty promise.  My Republican colleagues claim we need to pass this bill to give people ``freedom'' to buy health insurance. Let me tell you, freedom to buy health insurance and actually being able to afford health insurance are two very different things.  They keep talking about ``access'' to health care. Access is not coverage. When they talk about access and freedom, they are conceding that this bill does nothing to ensure that Americans have affordable, comprehensive health insurance to cover them no matter what their health care needs are.  The Republicans so clearly believe that Americans just need freedom to buy insurance, that when asked what a pregnant woman should do if her state no longer requires insurance companies to cover maternity care, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said she can ``figure out a way to change the state [she] lives in.'' How callous are my Republican colleagues to believe that is a real option for Americans?

That cancer consists of questions pertaining to the relationship of this administration with  We know that the Russians intervened in the last election with the goal of advantaging Trump's campaign over Hillary We know that there were numerous Trump campaign transition team and administration officials in contact with the Russians--prior to, during, and after the campaign.  We know that there is a pattern of these individuals at first denying such contacts but later, after being forced to come clean, admitting them.  Examples to date include: former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Roger Stone, who admitted that he was in contact with Guccifer 2.0, the hacker that the CIA says is a Russian front for military intelligence.  We know that the Attorney General gave false testimony, deliberate or otherwise, to the Senate regarding meetings with Russian officials.  We know that President Trump has financial ties with Although he denies it, we now know that there are large Russian investments in The Trump The President's son, Donald Trump, Jr., said a few years ago that money was ``flowing in'' from That obviously can have a major influence on the President and on the decisions of his administration.  We know that there was a change in the Republican platform dealing with Ukraine to favor Russia, a change that was engineered by the Trump campaign.  We even know who in the Trump campaign gave the instruction to make this change.  We know that there is an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI of possible collusion by the Trump campaign in the admitted Russian intervention in the attempt by Russia to subvert the 2016 Presidential campaign.  Knowing all this, it is impossible to ignore or to dismiss questions concerning the credibility of the administration, and, certainly, we must ask questions regarding its legitimacy as well, if there is persuasive evidence that crimes were committed in colluding with Russia to subvert the election.                              {time}  1730  We have a duty to resolve this question, to get answers, to pursue the truth, and to remove any cancer that we may find.

Yet, to date, the Republicans have opposed our amendments and voted down our resolutions of inquiry, in effect, abdicating their constitutional obligation to provide oversight and enforce the law.  Now we have the spectacle of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee conducting an obvious coverup, failing to share important information with members of the committee--information, I would add, that revealed President Trump's allegations against former President Obama as completely false--while inappropriately briefing people at the White House on the committee's investigation, the very same people who are the subjects of the investigation.  This is so absurd, so inappropriate, and beyond belief that it is tough to accept the reality of the situation. Sadly, this isn't a television drama we can turn off or walk away from. The integrity of our democratic system of government is at stake.  What we need is honesty. The American people must have faith in the integrity of our government, and it is our job to ensure it. It is time for answers.  If there is no evidence of misconduct, then we should move on. But if the truth reveals a conspiracy, if there is proof of criminal conduct, Donald Trump must be held accountable, and the people around him must be held accountable, and we must act.

Well, 70 years ago, Harry Truman knew how complicated it could be when he first proposed national health insurance. Lyndon Johnson knew more than 50 years ago when he proposed, successfully, Medicare and Richard Nixon knew when he proposed the individual mandate. Bob Dole knew when he proposed the individual mandate. In Massachusetts, Mitt Romney knew when he proposed the individual mandate.  Mr.Speaker, recently, within the last week, the great on-the-street writer, Jimmy Breslin, died. Amongst the great columns and the great books he wrote, one of them that he wrote that will be with us in a timeless manner was ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.''  That is what this institution has been like for the last 10 days. There were caucuses and there were conferences. People were running back and forth with new CBO scores and coming back to the floor with new proposals. Members are put in the position of being offered special arrangements so that they might be brought over the goal line--that, after 61 times they have voted in this House to try to repeal the Affordable Care  Well, here is what we have in front of us this afternoon: a CBO score says that 24 million Americans will see either an increase in premiums or they will lose their insurance, there will be an imposition of an age tax on older Americans, and a tax cut of $1 trillion. This bill has gone from bad to worse.  If that wasn't enough, to get the votes to pass the bill, they want to cut prescription drug benefits, mental health benefits, hospital benefits, and maternity care; and, yes, every one of us in this institution knows a family who is struggling with a loved one's addiction, and they want to roll back that benefit.  Recently, the conservative columnist Bill Kristol tweeted:       The healthcare bill doesn't, A, lower costs that they have;      B, it doesn't improve insurance; C, it doesn't increase      liberty; D, it doesn't make health care better. So what is      the point?  Here is the point: it is a $1 trillion tax cut so that they can change the baseline for their tax cuts that are coming down the road. That is what this is about.  Now, the President said he wanted an insurance plan that covered all members of the American family. What they are offering up today is a plan that cuts health insurance for 24 million American family members. It does not increase coverage, it does not lower costs, and it does not strengthen consumer protections.  So what does it do?  Sadly enough, back to the old argument that we have had in this institution for years: a $1 trillion tax cut for the people at the top and special interests.  The former speaker here a minute ago, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, spoke about perfection. I was here when this legislation was authored, and I helped to write it. I can tell you this right now: we knew it was not about perfection, but we subscribed to the idea, as was the case with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, that we would improve it as time went on. We would fix it so that all members of the American family might benefit from the basic notion of access and affordability as it relates to health care.  So what do we have here?  $839 billion of cuts to Medicaid, which is now long-term care for members of the American family.  Do you know why?  Sixty percent of Medicaid dollars go to nursing home care, and they want to cut $839 billion to provide a $1 trillion tax cut. Let me tell you, members of the American family can understand that.  In Massachusetts, where proudly I can say 100 percent of the children in our State are covered, 97 percent of the adults in Massachusetts are covered. And guess what? It polls regularly in the high seventies as to consumer satisfaction. A Republican Governor of Massachusetts has advised them to go slowly and to go carefully, that this is not the path that they want to travel down, as well as other Governors across the country who happen to be a                              {time}  1400  The hard truth here today is they are asking the American family to pay more to get less. Dozens of Republicans have said so today.  Secretary Mnuchin recently said that ``there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' I hope that the Republican Conference confers with Secretary Mnuchin so that they might get their facts straight on this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts that relates to the debate we are having today.         Office of the Governor, Commonwealth of Massachusetts,            State House,                                       Boston, MA, March 21, 2017.       Dear Delegation Member: Health care is once again at the      forefront of national and state policy discussions; I know we      all share the goal of ensuring access to quality, affordable      health care coverage for the people of With      Congress set to take up the American Health Care Act (AHCA)      imminently, I wanted to share with you my administration's      analysis of the potential effects this bill would have on our      state.       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its score of      the AHCA on March 13. This analysis is broadly consistent      with concerns we have raised, with you and others, regarding      the bill's impact on the state and its residents' access to      affordable healthcare. Applying CBO's assumptions to      Massachusetts results in at least $1 billion of reduced      federal revenue beginning in 2020, and we estimate reduced      revenue of $1.3 billion in 2021, and $1.5 billion in 2022,      with likely a greater annual impact in the years that follow.       Specifically, our estimate extrapolated from the CBO      analysis of a $1.5 billion impact for FY 2022 includes $1.3      billion of annual MassHealth federal revenue losses and $200      million in annual reduced federal subsidies for private      insurance through the       Several key areas of concern for Massachusetts were not      included in the CBO analysis and could further impact the      Commonwealth's budget. For example, the CBO estimate does not      address 1115 waiver payments that we believe this bill would      put at risk. By FY22, the Commonwealth estimates an      additional $425-475 million per year of reduced federal      revenue in potential elimination of 1115 payments not      captured under the per capita targets, including federal      matching funds for a state-run ConnectorCare Wrap subsidy.       The actual experience for these and other factors is      significantly dependent on how the U.Department of Health      and Human Services implements the legislation and      unpredictable factors in the future (e.g., pharmaceutical      growth).       In addition to reduced federal revenue for Medicaid, the      CBO also projects a reduction in employer-sponsored health      insurance of 7 million people nationwide as a result of the      repeal of the federal Employer This would exacerbate      a trend that Massachusetts has seen over the last several      years. Massachusetts repealed the Chapter 58 Fair Share      Contribution in 2013 in order to comport with the My      administration has proposed reinstating an employers' shared      responsibility for the costs of health care. This would be      increasingly important if the federal Employer Mandate were      repealed, as the AHCA proposes.       The Commonwealth does have certain protections in place      that could mitigate the impact of some of these changes.      Massachusetts retains its individual health insurance      mandate, reducing the likelihood that many people would drop      out of the insurance market due to the repeal of the federal      mandate. Massachusetts also has protective insurance coverage      laws that would not be superseded by the federal legislation.       The AHCA includes a provision that would prevent Medicaid      from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for providing important      health services such as cancer screenings. My administration      opposes this provision, and has already committed to funding      these services with state dollars if it should pass.       During conversations with governors across the country, the      Trump Administration has expressed a general openness to      providing greater state flexibility with respect to health      care, including through a letter issued by HHS Secretary      Price on March 14 to states. Our administration will pursue      additional flexibilities to stabilize our markets and ensure      continued coverage for residents and we urge you to support      these efforts by leading discussions in Congress to ensure      the people of Massachusetts continue to have access to a      quality health care system.       Overall, our analysis indicates that the AHCA would      increasingly strain the fiscal resources necessary to support      the Commonwealth's continued commitment to universal health      care coverage. I hope this information is helpful to you as      Congress takes up the American Health Care       My administration and I will continue to stay in touch with      you as we work together to ensure access to quality,      affordable health coverage for all Massachusetts residents.

State of Michigan,                                             Executive Office,                                      Lansing, MI, March 21, 2017.     Sandy Levin,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Levin: As Congress considers      legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and      reform Medicaid, I want to ensure you are aware of the impact      that changes may have on beneficiaries in Michigan who rely      on these programs for access to care and overall health. I      also want to provide my perspective on priorities for federal      health reform and highlight how they have been utilized at      the state level to drive meaningful reform that has increased      access to cost-effective care.       In its current form, the American Health Care Act (AHCA)      shifts significant financial risk and cost from the federal      government to states without providing sufficient flexibility      to manage this additional responsibility. The proposed      legislation reduces federal resources that our state relies      on to assist 2.4 million Michiganders enrolled in traditional      Medicaid and the Healthy Michigan Plan, our state's      innovative Medicaid expansion program.       The current federal debate has largely focused on the      Medicaid expansion population, including over 650,000      childless adults and parents that are enrolled in the Healthy      Michigan However, half of all children in Michigan are      served by traditional Medicaid each year and roughly 67,000      of them currently reside in your district. Moreover, more      than 338,000 individuals with disabilities receive their      health care and support services through Medicaid and an      estimated 22,000 of these individuals reside in your      district. Altogether, there are 1.75 million children,      seniors, pregnant women and disabled individuals served by      traditional Medicaid in Michigan, and roughly 119,000 of them      reside in your district. As you know, these are our state's      most vulnerable citizens, friends and neighbors. The proposed      AHCA will adversely impact them.       While reforming the nation's health care system is vital,      it is imperative that gains in health coverage and access to      care are maintained. These ideas are not mutually exclusive.[[Page H2431]]       In Michigan, innovative approaches to improving quality and      value are being utilized to support each individuals'      personal responsibility for their health. This has resulted      in significant reductions of nearly 50% in uncompensated      care, a dramatic decrease in the number of individuals using      the emergency room as a regular source of care, and nearly      85% of enrollees taking part in annual primary or preventive      care visits. As drafted, the AHCA would eliminate coverage      from the 49,000 individuals enrolled in the Healthy Michigan      Plan in your district, as Michigan taxpayers assume      responsibility over time for up to $800 million in additional      costs. This cost shift will trigger a provision in Michigan      law ending the Healthy Michigan program.       I believe Medicaid reform is necessary, however, that      reform must be approached deliberately to ensure that state      flexibility and innovation are valued, Michigan providers      remain strong, and our most vulnerable citizens do not fall      through the cracks. Ideally, this would be done by removing      prescriptive program requirements that require states to seek      waivers when implementing innovative ideas. Instead, states      would be given performance based outcomes with federal      involvement only when performance is lacking.       If Congress moves forward in passing the proposed AHCA,      which shifts financial risk to state taxpayers, my      administration and the Michigan Legislature must possess the      flexibility necessary to manage that risk. The Trump      Administration may provide additional flexibility to states,      however, I am concerned that federal agencies may encounter      limitations in federal statute. Ultimately, Michigan cannot      rely solely on the promise of future action without seeing      all of the tools that will be at our disposal to manage the      program.       In addition, under the proposed AHCA, I remain concerned      about the affordability of insurance coverage in the      individual market. I am particularly concerned about the      impact this legislation may have on older Michiganders who      could see significant cost increases.       I welcome the opportunity to partner with you to provide      greater federal budget predictability and improve health      outcomes of Michiganders, which in turn relieves pressure on      other social programs. I have worked with other Governors to      develop a proposal to accomplish these objectives while also      preserving coverage for Michiganders, and I hope this can      serve as a blueprint for you as we work together to      accomplish these goals.       I look forward to continuing our partnership to help      Michiganders lead healthy and productive lives.

998,topic-id,606,"Mr.President, for years, I have been working to make sure that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reliable tools to forecast hurricanes. Today the Senate will come together on legislation to get us closer to that goal. In May 2016, just before the start of hurricane season, the Commerce Committee held a hearing on preparedness. At that hearing, I asked the then-Director of the National Hurricane Center, Rick Knabb, about the fact that NOAA has two P3 propeller aircraft that fly into the storm, but only the one Gulfstream jet that can fly high enough and long enough to get above the storm. Flying above the storm is critical because the scientists drop sondes out of the belly of the aircraft that fall through the storm sending measurements of the entire vertical profile. This is vital to telling us where the storm is headed and whether it is weakening or strengthening.  Having only one Gulfstream is a single point of failure because, if the plane is out of commission, we do not have a backup ready to go. Unfortunately, my fears were realized a few short months later. During a Hurricane Hermine reconnaissance mission, NOAA had to ground the Gulfstream for emergency corrosion repairs. Luckily, a plane owned by the National Science Foundation and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research was not on a mission at the time and was able to fill in for the NOAA Gulfstream, but you can imagine that this will not always be the case. While the hurricane season seems to be getting longer, the NOAA plane is getting older. We must have a reliable backup. So, in January, I filed 153, legislation to require NOAA to acquire sufficient backup capability for our hurricane hunter aircraft. I am pleased today that the Senate will unanimously pass this measure as part of a broader weather bill.  I take comfort that even in times of great divisiveness, the Senate can come together on matters of public[[Page S2116]]safety. The power of Mother Nature must be taken seriously. Consider the flooding in California or the devastating tornadoes that hit Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida early this year. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew took 46 lives in the United States alone. In addition to requiring backup capability for the hurricane hunters, the broader bill we will pass tonight, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, will improve NOAA s ability to understand, predict, and--most importantly--to warn people about all kinds of weather events that dramatically affect the economy and people's daily lives. It also includes a reauthorization of the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research These provisions will give NOAA the tools to protect life and property and to support continued economic growth.

50,topic-id,200,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, under the ACA, 5 to 6 million Americans were kicked off their healthcare plans, including 300,000 of my fellow Washingtonians who lost coverage despite repeated promises they could keep their plans. A majority of Americans have faced skyrocketing costs, reduced access to quality care, and fewer choices for their families. I believe we can and we must do better.  Under this bill, Americans will have health care that fits individual and family needs instead of federally mandated, one-size-fits-all coverage that is simply unaffordable for far too many people. This bill strengthens and guarantees access for the most vulnerable in our communities.  The ACA has failed. I made a promise to the thousands of my constituents who have told me of the devastation this law has wreaked on their lives that I would not forget them. Americans in every election since 2010 have said loud and clear the same thing, and it is time that we listened.  Mr.Speaker, the American Health Care Act is the first major step in keeping that promise, and I think that we need to take it.

812,topic-id,1812,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 233, providing for consideration of H.1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will reform the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, Science Advisory Board to ensure that it is unbiased and transparent in performing its duties.  The SAB, the Science Advisory Board, was first established by Congress in 1978 and plays a vital role in reviewing the scientific foundation of EPA's regulatory decisions, while also providing critical advice to us here in Congress as well as the The information it reviews is used to justify important policy decisions at the EPA and should be held to the highest standards because it is imperative that the regulated community and the public can have confidence that EPA decisions are grounded, that science should be both reproducible and transparent.  However, shortcomings with the current process have arisen in recent years, including limited public participation, EPA interference with expert advice, potential conflicts of interest, and serious deficiencies with the process to select the board members. Far too often, the SAB's authority has been used by the EPA to silence dissenting scientific views and opinions, rather than promoting the impartiality and fairness that is the cornerstone of unbiased scientific advice.                              {time}  1230  At its inception, the SAB was intended to function independently in order to provide candid advice and guidance to the Yet, if the Agency undermines this autonomy, then the SAB's value to both the EPA and Congress, I believe, is severely diminished.  Mr.Speaker, to address these issues, H.1431 would reform the SAB and reaffirm its independence so the public and regulated entities can have that confidence that sound science is driving policy decisions at the  The bill makes several important reforms to the SAB, such as requiring board members to be qualified experts; disclosing conflicts of interest and sources of bias; and ensuring that the views of members, including the dissenting members, are available to the public. It provides the public with the opportunity to participate in the advisory activities of the board and gives people the ability to view the agency's responses to issues raised by the  Additionally, the bill requires that at least 10 percent of the board is comprised of State, local, and tribal experts; that board members do not participate in advisory activities that involve reviews or evaluations of their own work; and that EPA publicly disclose all board member recusals; and that comments are published in the Federal  So these reforms will improve the existing regulatory process, while also reinvigorating the scientific judgements that are often directly linked to regulatory decisions.  The EPA relies on SAB reviews and studies to support new regulations, new standards, assessments, and other Agency actions. A transparent and accountable Science Advisory Board is critically important and can assure the public that the data that Federal agencies rely on is scientifically sound and unbiased.[[Page H2530]]  This legislation would reinforce that the SAB process is a tool to help policymakers with complex issues, while also preventing the EPA from taking actions that impede the free flow of impartial scientific advice.  Mr.Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of an important measure that will improve the peer review process and ensure sound science is used in the Federal rulemaking process. It is a simple, relatively straightforward bill that will make the SAB more consistent, transparent, and accountable to our bosses, the American people.  Transparency in regulations based on the highest quality science should not be a partisan issue. In the 114th Congress, a nearly identical version of this bill was passed by the House, I am glad to say, with bipartisan support. I hope we can join together again to pass this important bill with support from Members of both sides of the aisle, from both parties.  I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Newhouse), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. This is the 23rd closed rule of this short, new Both Democrats and Republicans have been denied the opportunity to amend nearly 60 percent of the legislation that has been brought to the floor through the House Rules  This effort by Speaker Ryan and the Republican leadership to halt a fair and open debate in the people's House is outrageous. We are supposed to be a deliberative body where both parties get to deliberate. These Putinesque rules that shut down all debate need to stop. This isn't the  You know, I think Representative Rooney, a Republican, said it best last week: ``I've been in this job for 8 years, and I'm wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that's been something positive, that's been something other than stopping something else from happening.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, today we are considering a piece of legislation that seeks to prevent the EPA from protecting public health and the environment--not exactly positive.  This bill was brought to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting last night. And let me emphasize that, an emergency meeting.  Mr.Speaker, I think the American people have a pretty good idea of what is and what isn't an emergency. A tree falls on your house, that is an emergency. Your rose bush needs pruning, not an emergency. Timmy fell down a well, that is an emergency. Timmy might stub his toe, not an emergency.  On April 28, the government will run out of money. That is an emergency, even if it is self-inflicted by the And we have no shortage of other actual emergencies that we should be dealing with: a devastating opioid epidemic, crumbling roads and bridges, mounting evidence of Russian meddling in our election, and people being killed every day due to gun violence, not to mention Flint, Michigan, is still dealing with the residual health effects of toxically polluted water.  These are just a few examples of actual emergencies that Congress is doing nothing to address. Instead, the underlying bill, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, is brought to the Rules Committee and to the House floor as an emergency piece of legislation.  As we learned last week, the American people are paying attention to what we do here. They are smart enough to know what an emergency is. And this bill isn't addressing an emergency, Mr.Speaker; it is creating one.  The Science Advisory Board at the EPA provides a way for the Agency to use sound, independent, and objective scientific data to help make their decisions. Science, Mr.Speaker--you may have heard of it--is kind of a big deal.  But this bill won't help the EPA to include more scientists in the decisions. It will force them to include people with potential financial conflicts of interest on the Science Advisory Board so long as they disclose them. I mean, do we really want people on our advisory boards if they could profit from a decision that they are about to make? There is nothing scientific about corruption, and this is exactly what this bill will open the door to.  This bill also limits the participation of scientific experts at the EPA, leading to a disproportionate representation of big business and corporate special interests. Are these really the people we want making decisions about the health of our kids and the policies that should be protecting our environment? Is that what we want?  So what is this bill really about? Well, it is about allowing the Republicans' big corporate cronies a direct route to the decisionmakers at the It is about disrupting the EPA's ability to fairly enforce the rules, hold corporate polluters accountable, and protect our health. It is about undermining scientific fact with political cronyism.  Now, maybe things have changed lately. It has been a while since my last science class. But I am pretty sure there is no step in the scientific method that says consult corporate cronies. The truth is that this Republican majority wants the EPA to base their decisions on fiction, not fact.  Americans can't afford to have the EPA run by people who live in a fantasyland where facts and science don't matter. Our environment and the health of our families are too important.  This law is going to have real-life consequences. It undermines science, hurts the environment, and it helps polluters. We need to allow the EPA to make decisions based on fact. We need to ensure that EPA is always free from financial conflicts, not making decisions based on panels filled with industry insiders like the ones that this bill would create.  Mr.Speaker, this bill defies logic. It defies reason. It defies sanity. It will hurt the people who sent us here, and it will help polluters. Republicans are putting corporate greed ahead of public health, and the American people will be the ones who will suffer. Americans deserve better. We should be fighting on behalf of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, let me tell my Republican friends what I tell first graders that I talk to back in my district in Massachusetts when I go to visit their schools. I usually begin by telling them that science is important. It is a big deal, and it is such a big deal that all our schools teach it. And if you do your homework and if you study hard and you pay attention, you might grow up someday to become a scientist, and scientists are people who dedicate their lives to protecting the health and well-being of people all over the world, and they dedicate their lives to protecting our planet.  Scientists tell us things that are really important. They tell us things like climate change is caused by greenhouse gasses, something my Republican friends continually deny. They tell us that polluted air can give children asthma. They tell us that lead in children's drinking water causes learning problems. They tell us pesticide exposure can cause cancer. These are important things.  We all learned in school, thanks to science, that the Earth orbits around the Sun, that gravity causes this pen to fall when I drop it, that plants turn sunshine into energy, that dinosaurs roamed the Earth millions of years ago.  Mr.Speaker, the first graders I talk to, they get it. They understand the importance of science. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues in this Chamber do not. And I would bet that those first graders understand the importance of making sure that it is scientists who sit on scientific advisory boards and not corporate cronies.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2529-3.txt,2275,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,29.0,March
813,topic-id,300,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the gentleman's comments. In fact, some of those comments he was making I thought he was quoting me, or at least quoting parts of my own speech.  Certainly, I agree that the decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency should be based on fact, not by industry insiders, and that is exactly[[Page H2531]]what this legislation would do. I can't think of any instance where asking for more full public participation as well as transparency is not a positive step, and that is exactly what we are trying to do here.  In reference to the number of closed rules that we have had this year, let me just remind the good gentleman that 15 out of the 23 closed rules were actually the Congressional Review Act, the CRAs that we have been working on. They are prescribed to be a closed rule. That is the nature of a  So I would think that, in the good gentleman's estimation of this bill and all the negative things that could potentially come of it, that we should be able to come to some bipartisan agreement on this, especially considering the political climate that we are in today, the occupant of the White House today, certainly in Republican hands, and I would think our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would be very interested in ensuring an unbiased source of information that comes from the SAB to give to the EPA in making their important decisions.

815,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we get back to the bill at hand, I think it is important that there are a lot of important topics out there that people want to touch on, and that is all well and good. Just like my friend from Texas, a fine member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, brought up other bills that are important and that relate to what we are talking about here today, and I think that is important as well.  But I think I see an underlying theme here. We all agree on one thing: we want the EPA to use science. We want public participation. We want and we need transparency.  This is certainly a positive step in a bill, Mr.Speaker, that went through regular order, that was introduced with bipartisan support, that went through the markup process, and that was reported out without amendments, something that this body in the last Congress passed, I believe, in a bipartisan fashion.  Just to underscore the importance of taking this important step--and let me underscore again--no matter which side of the aisle you are on, it is important that we do this because of who you may think is the right person or the wrong person occupying the White House, it is important that the EPA has an unbiased source of information in order for it to make its decisions.

818,topic-id,1038,"I think we have run to the end of our speakers.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, let me first remind Members that we are asking for a ``no'' vote on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, we will bring up an amendment that will allow the bill that Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings have introduced, which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election.  This is the appropriate place to do it because we are blocked in every other way in terms of trying to bring this to the floor, and the Rules Committee is a committee that prioritizes legislation that helps set the agenda, so this ought to be part of it. This anti-science bill can still be debated and voted on. It won't derail that, but it will allow the House to be able to deliberate on this bill that would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.                              {time}  1300  This is a big deal. The American people deserve the truth. My Republican colleagues ought to get out of the way and allow this commission to be created so that the American people can actually have some trust in a process that determines the extent to which the Russians interfered in our election.  Again, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.  With regard to the rule that we are debating today, I would again remind everybody that this is a closed rule. There are some Members of this House who have never seen an open rule, ever. I hope that changes because I do think that, again, there ought to be more deliberation here, there ought to be more back and forth. Even ideas that I strongly disagree with on the Republican side, they ought to have the opportunity to come here and be able to present them and we can vote up or down on them.  I think we need to break this pattern of shutting the process down. It is what resulted in the debacle last week with your horrible healthcare bill, the one that only 16 percent of the American people supported. It is pretty hard to get that low, but my friends managed to be able to set a new record on unpopular legislation--so bad that it had to be withdrawn from the floor for consideration.  I would argue it is the closed, authoritarian-like process that produced a lousy bill. If my friends continue to adhere to this closed process, they are going to get more lousy pieces of legislation that are going to do great harm to the American people brought to this floor.  This bill that is before us today, again, has been brought to the floor under this expedited procedure called an emergency provision. It is just being rushed to the floor as an emergency.  This is not an emergency. The opioid crisis is an emergency; the crisis in Flint, Michigan, is an emergency; our crumbling infrastructure is an emergency. There are deficient bridges and roads in every one of our congressional districts. That is an emergency. We need to address that.  Keeping the government open is an emergency. But to say this is an emergency is kind of ridiculous. It is not an emergency. It is kind of like our house is on fire and you are saying: I will get out the hose later, but I need to wash the dishes first.  That is how this kind of fits into what we are doing here today. This doesn't qualify for that.  On the substance of the bill, we have this radical idea that scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory committees, not corporate cronies, not people who are interested in covering up for polluters or doing their bidding. We think experts and scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory boards. That is the radical idea that we have. This bill, unfortunately, undermines that.  What this bill does is threaten public health by stacking advisory boards with industry representatives, and it weakens scientific review. It is that simple. I don't care what your political ideology is, I don't think you want that.  Let me just mention some of the groups that are opposed to this:  The Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Geophysical Union, and the American Lung Association strongly oppose this bill. The American Public Health Association, the American Thoracic Society, and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America oppose this bill. Clean Water Action opposes this bill. Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense Action Fund, Health Care Without Harm, League of Conservation Voters, and the National Medical Association oppose this bill. The Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Union of Concerned Scientists all oppose this bill. The Food Policy Action opposes this bill.  I can go on and on. Every organization that is an advocate for the health and well-being of the American people oppose this bill. We are bringing it up for an up-or-down vote, no amendments, a closed rule, and here we are.  I would just say, Mr.Speaker, again, this is a bad idea. I guess if you are an ally of big corporations or of corporations that engage in pollution, this is a good idea. But if you are interested in protecting the health and well-being of the American people, and the globe, for that matter, this is a bad idea.  As I began, I mentioned that when I speak to first-graders, they understand the importance of science. They get it. They want us to be good stewards of the environment. They want us to protect this planet. They understand the importance of science.  But I am always amazed how many people in this Chamber just don't get it. I find that really sad. I want to give my kids, and someday my grandkids and great grandkids, a future where we respect the environment. When we pass bills like this, it makes that less certain.

This bill is a good idea, and I think the debate that we have had here today underscores the importance of this as we consider this under the rule.  H.1431 addresses problems that have arisen over the years with the Science Advisory Board, and actually would return the Board to its intended purpose--something maybe the gentleman does not agree with--to provide independent expert advice on scientific and technical information.  By modernizing the policies and the procedures of the governing of the SAB, Congress, with this bill, can take[[Page H2534]]critical steps to make sure that the SAB is best equipped to provide that independent, transparent, balanced review and the analyses of the science used that guides the EPA's regulatory decisions.  One key issue that this measure would address is the importance of having regulations that are supported by science and that are reproducible and accessible for peer review, not antiscience, like some people have said. Quite the opposite. We want science. We want good science.  The scientific method demands that the result of scientific studies be capable of replication. This is all the more critical when the information is used to develop and set public policy, which is why the methods and the data used by the EPA and the SAB must be publicly available for purposes of replication and verification. If you don't want public transparency, I guess you should vote ``no'' on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, opponents of the legislation have argued that it makes unnecessary and unproductive changes to the SAB, that it would restrict the ability of scientists to engage on the issues they specialize in, creates new burdens through the public comment and transparency provisions, and weakens the ability of the EPA to use the best available science and data to support its rules and regulations.  I believe that these arguments fail to recognize what this bill actually does accomplish. They seem to ignore the importance of reforming the Federal rulemaking process in a way that ensures sound science is the bedrock on which Federal rules and regulations are built--sound science; is that a radical idea--and that these are not predetermined political agendas.  Unfortunately, the EPA has diluted the Board's credibility by systematically silencing dissenting opinions, ignoring calls for balanced participation, and preventing the Board from responding to congressional reports. Fully 10 percent of the seats on the Board will be filled by State, local, and tribal representatives, improving the balance of that participation.  H.1431 simply encourages greater transparency, debate, and public participation in the Board, which will result in better decisionmaking at the I think that is something everyone should be able to agree on. I don't think public participation is a burden, but, rather, a benefit that improves the relationship and the interaction between Federal regulators and the public.  By strengthening public participation, improving the process for selecting expert advisers, and expanding transparency requirements, this legislation takes critical steps that will improve our regulatory system, while also ensuring that the most qualified and the most capable scientists are free to undertake a balanced and open review of regulatory science.  Mr.Speaker, it is time to update the law. It is time to restore independence to the Science Advisory It is time to strengthen scientific integrity. Science is an invaluable tool that helps policymakers navigate complex issues, yet this resource has been severely diminished if the EPA interferes with expert advice, limits public participation, and fails to disclose potential conflicts of interest.  As President Reagan said in guidance to the EPA: ``The purpose of the Science Advisory Board is to apply the universally accepted principles of scientific peer review to the research conclusions that will form the basis for EPA regulations, a function that must remain above interest group politics.''  Mr.Speaker, I believe H.1431 gets to the heart of President Reagan's point. Greater debate, unbiased scientific advice and independent peer-reviews, and public participation will only result in better decisionmaking at the Federal level. I believe that this is the goal we all share, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 233 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on Foreign After general      debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the      five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in      the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

200,topic-id,435,"Mr.Speaker, it is no surprise that the Democrats today are upset, that they are complaining that they don't like this bill, because their number one goal all along, and I have heard them say it to me in conversations over the years, their number one goal was to go to a single-payer system. They wanted government-run health care, and we are on the track to that today.  In fact, in my home State of South Dakota, at one time, we had 17 options and companies that people could shop for their healthcare policies from. Today we have two.  We are well down our road now to giving them exactly what they want. They hate this bill because it puts people back in control of their own health care. It doesn't let some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., decide what treatment they can get in the future. It lets people decide that with their doctors.  This is a vote, today, for freedom for people who have lived under the bureaucracy of the Federal Government not giving them options on how to take care of themselves and their families.  Rising costs, shrinking options, increasing bureaucracy under ObamaCare has taken healthcare control away from patients, away from people, away from families struggling to pay their bills; and, against their best and own common sense and household budgets, they are forced to pay $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 more per year for health coverage, health coverage which has a deductible so high that they don't even utilize it then because they can no way meet the $6,500 deductible, $10,000 deductible, $12,000 deductible. So they don't even use it at all if they do have it. Their stories are reflected in all the data that we have seen.  One hundred percent of the healthcare options on healthcare.gov in South Dakota have seen double-digit rate increases. Meanwhile, the number of providers families have to choose from has gotten much, much worse.  We have a responsibility to eliminate ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates, which today's legislation does. It also abolishes the taxes that were included in ObamaCare, up to $1 trillion of taxes that were put on health care in order to pay for the bill, which will be eliminated as well.  If left in place, the health insurance tax alone will raise costs on families up to $5,000 over the next decade.  Bipartisan congressional Members have repeatedly opposed taxpayer funding of abortions, and that is fixed in this bill as well.  When we talk about health care, we are talking about something very personal, which is why I want patients put back in control.

107,topic-id,734,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I remind my colleague, my chairman, Greg Walden, that his vote for this bill will result in 64,300 people from his congressional district in Oregon losing health coverage and care.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump and congressional Republicans are not leveling with the American people when they say no one will be worse off under this repeal bill. TrumpCare dismantles the health and economic security that millions of hardworking Americans have gained over the last 7 years, and it should be defeated.  There is a reason this bill was hatched up in the back rooms only to be finalized last night, and that is because congressional Republicans did not want the American people to see what was in it.  TrumpCare provides less coverage, fewer protections, and higher costs.  TrumpCare is Robin Hood in reverse, taking benefits and financial assistance from hardworking, middle class Americans and our most vulnerable in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest and the corporations.  TrumpCare cuts a combined $1 trillion from Medicare and These cuts are devastating, Mr. TrumpCare will ration care for the 76 million Americans who rely on Medicaid, including seniors with long-term care needs, Americans with disabilities, pregnant women, and vulnerable children.  I fear for seniors, Mr.Speaker, those in nursing homes. When States get less money, what will they do? They will give less money to nursing homes. We will go back to the days that I remember in New Jersey when nursing homes were terrible places, where there weren't enough nurses, where there were fires because of lack of maintenance of the nursing home.  Working families are going to pay more for less. They will see their premiums and deductibles skyrocket. My GOP colleagues talk about high deductibles and copays. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.  You are going to see that this repeal repeals the limits on deductibles and copays that exist under the current law. Out-of-pocket costs are going to go through the roof. The deductibles will go even higher. The copays will go even higher. The out-of-pocket costs will go even higher.  And the bottom line is Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 will pay an age tax and be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what younger people pay for their coverage.  I have heard my colleagues on the other side say, well, that is only fair. Well, I don't think it is fair that seniors should have to pay a lot more, that those between 50 and 64 should have to pay a lot more.  Also, TrumpCare leaves the sickest and vulnerable Americans at the mercy of insurance companies, allowing them to charge a 30 percent penalty or sick tax to those who are unable to maintain continuous coverage. So if you fail to pay your insurance for a month and then you want to get it again, even if you have a preexisting condition, which is often the case, you are going to pay a 30 percent penalty, or sick tax. I don't think that is very fair.  Last night, in order to garner votes from the extreme right in their party, House Republicans added a provision that eliminates protections for essential health benefits. Now, maybe people don't understand that, but let me explain it.[[Page H2416]]  The ACA ensured that, when a consumer purchased health insurance on the individual market or gained coverage through Medicaid expansion, their plan would cover 10 critical, essential benefits.  TrumpCare eliminates this guarantee, meaning that unscrupulous insurance companies can sell skeletal plans, junk insurance, without benefits for hospitalization, maternity care, mental health, drug treatment services, and Americans won't even know what they are getting. They won't realize that they have worthless insurance until they get sick and it is too late.  The bottom line is this bill should be defeated for so many reasons because so many more people will not have health insurance, because their costs are going to go up, and because they won't even know what insurance they are buying. We are going go to back to the old days of the Wild West when insurance companies could sell whatever junk insurance they want and the public won't even know what they are getting. It is a disaster for the American people.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, since the implementation of the ACA, over 3.9 million women age 18 to 64 have gained health coverage through The ACA ended gender rating, meaning that the insurance companies cannot charge women more than they charge men for the same coverage. TrumpCare also eliminates Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, reducing access to health care for women. Millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood for both routine and lifesaving care, such as preventative services, family planning, and preventing unwanted pregnancies. When the GPO strips Planned Parenthood funding, health care of women will suffer.  TrumpCare and its Medicare cuts also hurts seniors. Older Americans account for over 60 percent of Medicare spending. Insurance companies will now be able to charge more based on their age, which will increase premiums by thousands.  Mr.Speaker, watching Republicans sell this bill is like buying a used car from a guy with a crooked smile, even they don't believe in it.

552,topic-id,680,"Mr.Speaker, nearly every day now, we hear about new ways our enemies are trying to steal Americans' information. Just a couple weeks ago, two Russian hackers were indicted for stealing personal information from millions of us.  American consumers visit billions of internet destinations through a multitude of devices. Broadband providers potentially have access to every bit of data that flows from a consumer. The American people are rightfully concerned about companies selling their personal information, including sensitive information like their location, financial and health information, Social Security numbers, and information about their children.  Late last year, the FCC took steps to protect every American citizen's data and privacy, and the rules were simple: first, broadband providers had to ask their customers before selling any data; second, the companies had to take reasonable measures to protect that data; and third, the companies had to let people know if their data was stolen.  That was a good first step, Mr.But Congress also has a role in protecting our data, and we should be working in a bipartisan fashion to discuss ways we can better protect the American people's data. Instead, the Republicans have decided to spend this time wiping out the few privacy safeguards that we already have.  The FCC's cybersecurity rules are, in my opinion, not burdensome. They simply tell the network providers to be reasonable when protecting the data. That is all. The FCC left it to the companies, themselves, to use their best judgment about how to get the job done. They just needed to be reasonable.  It seems being reasonable is still too much for the Republicans--first in the Senate, and now here in the This resolution tells the companies charged with running the country's broadband networks that they no longer have to be reasonable when it comes to their customers' data.  So I say, Mr.Speaker, make no mistake: This resolution is a gift to countries like Russia who want to take our citizens' personal information. And if the House passes this resolution, it will go straight to the President's desk, a President who will be more than happy to sign his name to this gift to the  This resolution also gives large corporations free rein to take customers' data without anyone's permission. This debate is about whether Americans have the freedom to decide on our privacy.  We hear all kinds of complicated arguments about jurisdiction, implementation dates, and who knows what else, but these arguments just muddy the water.  Republicans will say that the FCC's rules are confusing to consumers, people won't know what to do if they are asked first before broadband companies sell their sensitive information. If that were the case, we would have heard from people who oppose the rules, but we simply have not heard any of those concerns. The facts speak for themselves. Consumers want more privacy protection, not less.  Seventy-four percent of Americans say it is very important that they be in control of information, and 91 percent of people feel they have lost control[[Page H2495]]over their own information. There are real consequences to these feelings. Nearly half of Americans say they limit their online activity because they are worried about their privacy and security. That is why they overwhelmingly support stronger protections.  The FCC listened to the American people and adopted reasonable rules. Despite Republican claims to the contrary, the rules were not hard to follow. The rules still allow broadband companies to offer services based on their customers' data, and they can still customize ads or send reminders.  The FCC's rules simply required companies to ask people first before selling their sensitive information. That is it. In fact, I had hoped the FCC would have gone even further, but the agency chose this more moderate approach.  So as this debate proceeds, we should be asking one simple question: Should the American people have the freedom to choose how their information is used or should the government give that freedom away?  I think the answer is clear. I stand with the American people, and, therefore, I strongly oppose this legislation.

The reality is that more jobs and property will be lost without reducing our CO2 output. More CO2 will lead to more acidification which will lead to less fish and less fishermen.

394,topic-id,2638,"Mr.President, President Trump said in his inaugural address that we have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own. I think he was right. Today, the question is, Will we add another commitment to defend yet another foreign country?  For decades, NATO has been an organization in which the United States disproportionately spends our blood and our treasure. The other NATO countries have largely hitched a ride on a U.train that subsidizes their defenses and allows them to direct their revenues to their own domestic concerns. In short, Uncle Sam is the Uncle Patsy for the rest of the world.  The question today is, Will adding to NATO another country with fewer than 2,000 soldiers be in our self-interest?  It has fewer than 2,000 soldiers and is a small country in a distant part of the world. Will they make you sleep safer at night? The answer is an emphatic no.  There is no national security interest that an alliance with Montenegro will advance. If we invite Montenegro into NATO, it will be a one-way street, with the United States committing to defending yet another country and with you, the taxpayer, being stuck with the bill.  Even the advocates of Montenegro's joining NATO admit as much. The Senate hearing on admitting Montenegro to NATO was really just a punching session about Not one word was said about allowing Montenegro into NATO or how it would advance our own national security. We were going to send a message to Even the citizens of Montenegro are divided on this. About half of them want to be in NATO, and the other half does not want to be in  But it is not really about them; it is about us. Is admitting Montenegro to NATO good for us? Our national security is our national security. Is Montenegro going to defend the United States? Are they of any importance to our national security or, perhaps, will they entangle us in local, historic, regional conflicts in the area?  We must ask: Is Montenegro an asset to the defense of the United States? That is the question at hand.  The answer is a simple one. Admitting Montenegro to NATO will do nothing to advance our national security, and it will do everything to simply add another small country to NATO's welfare wagon.  Advocates for expanding NATO believe that, unless the whole world joins NATO, Russia will conquer the world, but the truth is more nuanced. During the Cold War, the myth of Russian might was endlessly circulated here at home, and the effect was the production of endless munitions and ever-expanding debt. You are still paying the tab for that. The Cold War ended, and the Soviet Union failed, not because our military might overcame them but because our economic system outlasted them. They were defeated. Capitalism defeated socialism.  If there is one message that Americans should get, it is that capitalism is stronger than socialism. We should not flirt with political leaders in our country who promote what caused the Soviet Union to fail.  Now we are told we must fear Russia again--fear the Russian bear. Yet, if you look closely, you will see that Russian aggression around the world and particularly around the former Soviet satellites is an attempt to mask a weak economy that runs the same risk of overextension that caused the Soviet Empire to collapse. Russia is weak. Russia is weak because of corruption, oligarchy, and human rights abuses. If Russia continues on this path, it may well encounter the same cataclysm that brought down the Soviet  Without question, Russia is an adversary, a country that ignores international norms, does not respect the territorial integrity of its neighbors. Yet someone must ask: Is it in our national interest to insist that countries of the former Soviet Union be in NATO?  The debate today is not just about The same cheerleaders for Montenegro's being in NATO want Ukraine in NATO and want Georgia in This is about NATO's expansion in general, and this is a chance to have a real debate.  If both Ukraine and Georgia were in NATO today, we would be involved in a world war with Shouldn't someone speak up? Shouldn't we have some sort of national debate before we commit our sons and daughters to war in a faraway land?  One thing is for certain: Russia will always care more about those lands than we will. Does that make Russian aggression right? Absolutely not.  Our decision--the decision at hand--is: Are we willing to send our sons and daughters to fight in border disputes over Montenegro? Most Americans couldn't find Montenegro on the map. Are you willing to send your kids there to fight?  That is what this is about, and this is sluffed over. They are going to forbid amendments. I forced this debate. Nobody wanted to have this debate. They want to rubberstamp it. They want no debates, and they want to send your kids to war with no debate. Today, they will pass this over my objections, but they will allow no amendments. When I finish this speech, I will ask for an amendment, and it will be denied because they do not want to debate whether your sons and daughters go to war. I find that appalling. I am ashamed of a Senate that will not have a debate and will not have a vote.  From the very beginning, our Republic was founded on a deep suspicion of entangling alliances. Our Founders wanted to do everything possible to avoid the endless, chronic wars in In Europe, for centuries, Kings from one nation fought their brothers and their cousins in other nations. This meaningless fratricide continued even into the 20th century.  The Founding Fathers were emphatic in their desire to avoid endless war. Washington wrote that our true policy was to steer clear of a permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world. Jefferson echoed this when he famously wrote of peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations and of entangling alliances with none.  Even in modern times, such military heroes as President Eisenhower opposed intervention in Hungary, even when the naked aggression of the Soviets was appalling. Eisenhower likely may have had no real opportunity, though, because the Soviet Union had rolled in with 200,000 troops and 4,000 tanks.  At least part of the decision not to go into Hungary in the fifties was not for a lack of sympathy for freedom, not for[[Page S1990]]a lack of sympathy for self-determination of a country. It was the real politic decision of a nuclear confrontation with a nuclear  Fast-forward to today. For 16 years, we have been at war in the Middle East--16 years. If I had been here, I would have voted for going after the people who had attacked us on 9/11. Our justified response, though, has drug on and on. There are people who are fighting in the war who were not born on 9/11. The Congress voted after 9/11 to go to war. It voted to go after the people who planned and plotted the attacks on the World Trade That vote from 15 years ago is used to justify all war that is everywhere on the planet.  There has been no meaningful debate on the wars we are currently involved in in the Middle We currently fight illegally and unconstitutionally in the Middle East because your representatives are afraid to have a public debate. They will stifle debate at all costs, and they will broker no amendments. They will allow no amendments to occur.  Our unrestricted, unvoted-upon involvement in war everywhere informed my opposition to expand Everyone likes to talk about NATO's article 5 obligation to come to the defense of any NATO allies that are attacked. That is in the treaty. If Montenegro is attacked, we will have to respond, but my concern is that many in Congress believe that article 5, in saying that we have to defend Montenegro, farms out to an international body this power to declare war, and they do not think they have to vote again.  You don't believe me?  They have not voted for 15 years for war, and we are still at war. We continue to go to new countries for war with no vote. Do you think that Montenegro will not be attacked and that there will not be a war without a vote? This is their history. Their history is one of not obeying the David Fromkin puts it this way: ``If it is now agreed by treaty that an attack on a . . . NATO ally is deemed an attack on the United States, then it can be argued that the President is empowered without congressional authorization to send us to war.''  Don't believe me? We have been at war for 15 years. We have been at war with dozens of new tribes, dozens of new countries, with no votes on war.  The most important vote a legislator will ever take is whether to go to war. Yet today we will vote for an automatic war if somebody invades And mark my words--they won't obey the They will say: We voted to put them in Article 5 says we have to defend them.  That is not the law of the land, and we should have to vote in But nobody obeys the law. So if you are worried about whether your kids will be sent to the Balkans or whether your kids will be sent to Ukraine or Georgia, call your representative and tell them:  This is the crux of the debate. Congress has abdicated its role in declaring war. For 16 years, we have been at war in the Middle East with dozens of different tribes and dozens of countries and yet no vote. People say: Well, we should fight Well, let's vote on it. Let's declare war or not. But you can't tell me that ISIS has anything to do with 9/11. They don't. Many of their fighters weren't even born then.  The authorization for war in Iraq was specific to a specific enemy in a specific place. So was the authorization after 9/11. The authorization for war in Afghanistan was specific. It says: necessary and appropriate force against those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11 attacks. It was actually put in the authorization for force that it was about 9/11. None of what is going on is about 9/11 anymore. They are not the same people. Some of the people we are fighting now didn't like those people.  There is a whole confusing set of religious wars that have been going on for 1,000 years in the Middle Yet your representatives will say: Send me your son, send me your daughter, but we don't have time to vote on whether it should be a declared war.  This vote is now used to justify a war around the globe, a vote from 9/11--from 15 years ago. It is a lie, and it is a disservice to our young men and women to have them fight under false pretenses where the Senators don't seem to have time to have a debate. No active war anywhere around the globe that the United States is involved with has been authorized by  We dropped more bombs the other day in We sent a man right into Raise your hand if you know what the hell is going on in Yemen and who is fighting whom and who is our enemy. The one we killed the other day was al-Qaida--probably a bad guy. He was actually fighting against the Houthis, whom we are also fighting against.  Who are the good guys? Shouldn't we have a debate? Shouldn't we decide whether we are going to war in Yemen? Should we be giving the Saudis bombs? They bombed a funeral procession. They killed 150 civilians and 500 people. We just let it go on. We keep giving them weapons. I have tried to stop selling bombs to the Saudi Arabians, but the majority up here says: Keep giving them to them. Keep giving them the weapons, and let them indiscriminately kill whoever the hell they want.  So NATO--should we expand it? Perhaps what we should do is make it clear that the NATO treaty is not a blind, open-ended promise to go to war anywhere, anytime.  Before we go to final passage, I will offer one amendment. This amendment will be blocked because they do not want debate and because they will be embarrassed if they have to vote against this amendment. But realize what this amendment asks. My amendment states that nothing in the NATO treaty--particularly the article 5 promise to come to the rescue of anyone attacked--none of this can happen without an official vote to declare war. So what is my amendment stating? The Constitution--article I, section 8--says we don't go to war without a vote and a debate. Do you know what they will do to get around it? I think we can assume that they are against the Constitution because they are not going to allow the amendment. How long would it take? It takes 15 minutes to vote around here. I am about done speaking. We could have one 15-minute vote on an amendment. I would grant back the time if we would have a vote, but they don't want to debate it because they are embarrassed that they are sending your sons and daughters to war without ever debating or voting on it.  This, to me, is a tragedy. It is sad to me. It makes me ashamed of the body that we will do this. Probably what is worse is then they clamor to the floor, their mouths agape, ajar, calling other people traitors, acting as if I care less about your sons and daughters because I want to have a debate on war before we go to war, preventing an amendment from happening and then having the gall to come to the floor and accuse their philosophic opponents of being traitors and being allies with the  Is this what we have come to? Is this where we are as America, that you can't take a principled stand against war; that you can't stand up on principle and say: Are we really going to go to war over Montenegro, over Ukraine? Are we really going to go to war over Georgia? And then you are accused of not being patriotic to your country.  I care as much as anybody about our soldiers. When I talk to our young men and women who serve, do you know what they tell me? They want someone to stand up and have a debate. They will do what they are told. Our soldiers are brave, and they will go where they are told, and they will obey orders. But the people here who are these mouthpieces for war, who think every soldier wants to go to war, I suggest they go out and meet the soldiers and ask them whether they want the civilian Senators to debate and have a formal declaration of war. That is all I am asking for--15 minutes and an amendment that says we will obey the  If article 5 says we need to go to war and Montenegro is attacked, we will do the proper thing.

397,topic-id,547,"Mr.President, it is important to know what just happened. We closed off the debate, and as far as a filibuster goes, we are having a debate and a vote. What they wanted was a rubberstamp and an easy passage without debate. We are having a bit of a debate, and that is good. Unfortunately, we will not be allowed to amend the bill.  My amendment is germane to the bill. It has to do with what article 5 means in the treaty we are signing. What it says is that we will not necessarily take article 5 to mean that we are going to war, that we would do the constitutional duty, and that is to vote about whether we go to war. So the amendment is very clear that we would obey the  By blocking the vote, we have to realize that those blocking the vote have decided that really it should be automatic, that your sons and daughters will be sent to war automatically without a vote, without a declaration of war. You say: Well, maybe they don't mean that. Maybe they would obey the  They don't now. So everything in evidence shows us that the chance that in the future they will obey the Constitution is about zero. But so ashamed are they of the fact that we will fight more wars without a declaration, without a vote--they won't allow a vote on the amendment because they would be voting against the So, instead, they will block the amendment.  That is essentially what this debate is about: Are we automatically obligated to go to war without a vote by Congress? That is what the vote is about. It is incredibly germane. It goes to the heart of the bill. It goes to the heart of the NATO treaty. Does article 5 mean you automatically go to war, or would you go through the normal processes of going to war? Now, some will say: Oh, well, we would never go to war. It might not be so bad, but it would be difficult.  Do you know when we have gone to war? We have actually gone unanimously when we have done it the right way. When we were attacked on 9/11 and they came to Congress, do you know what the vote was? We are not about letting people attack us as a country, and I would have voted for that.  When we were attacked in Pearl Harbor, what did FDR do? The thing that great leaders would do--and I am not a huge fan always of FDR, but he did the right thing. He came to Congress the next day. I think it was on December 8 that they voted unanimously to go to war. That is the way it was done once upon a time.  When you are attacked, people do rally to the country and they rally to the flag, but we shouldn't have an automatic stamp that says: We are going to war anywhere without any restraint, without any control or separation of power.

193,topic-id,329,"Mr.Speaker, today we are taking a very important step to lift the burden of the Affordable Care Act off of the backs of the American people. A key component of this is repealing the burdensome mandates and tax increases that were imposed to help fund this failed law. This includes the medical device tax, a senseless policy that placed an excise tax on lifesaving medical technology.  What did this achieve? A loss of 30,000 high-paying American jobs, less research and development, canceled projects, and postponed expansions. Most importantly, it hurt patients.  There is good news. Just a few years ago, in 2015, we came together on a bipartisan basis and suspended the tax for 2 years. We are seeing positive results. Companies are now hiring again, we have increased research and development, and we have new investments in facilities coming online.  We need to permanently repeal this onerous tax or it is going to start up again. Voting ``yes'' today means permanent repeal of the medical device tax.  Mr.Speaker, I am also encouraged to see several provisions I have authored to enhance and expand the use of health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts that are included in this legislation today.  HSAs and FSAs are now more popular than ever and used by 20 million It is time to remove the restrictions on HSAs that were imposed in ObamaCare so that we can make them more accessible and easier to use and empower Americans to take more control of their healthcare decisions.  Expanding HSAs will help us also begin to address the rising costs of health care. One recent study showed that, when a large employer switched their employees over to an HSA plan, it lowered their healthcare spending by an average of $900 per employee over a 5-year period. That is real savings, Mr. Let's support a better way forward to lower healthcare costs for patients and put them back in control of their healthcare decisions.                              {time}  1415  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2393.txt,1930,ALZHEIMER'S IN AMERICA,2017.0,24.0,March

Unfortunately, right now, Members--colleagues from the other side of the aisle--are threatening that very precedent.  As I said on the floor earlier this year, President Donald Trump promised the American people he would nominate an unwavering supporter of the Constitution to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice This President has kept his promise. He has nominated somebody who was actually confirmed here in the Senate not that long ago by a voice vote by Members who are still here in the Senate, many of them. This was a nomination to the Tenth Circuit, a role that this man, the nominee, filled with great honor and much distinction.  Judge Neil Gorsuch's record of service lives up to the highest standards for a Federal judge. His academic and legal records are impeccable. He has demonstrated a keen understanding and appreciation for the rule of law, and he spoke so articulately in hour after hour of interrogation, actually, in his confirmation hearing just last week. Most importantly, Judge Gorsuch has repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to the Constitution and to our founding principles of economic opportunity, fiscal responsibility, limited government, and most important, individual liberty.  His testimony last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee was masterful. It absolutely convinced me that he is the man for this job. Judge Gorsuch listened to questions, carefully responded thoughtfully, and he gave an indication into his own demeanor that he would use in the Supreme Judge Gorsuch listened to questions carefully over and over. He illustrated the ability to show a balance of judgment, which is what we look for in a lifetime appointment like this. He made it abundantly clear that the role of the judicial branch is to interpret--not to make law but to interpret the law.[[Page S2080]]  In my own individual meeting with Judge Gorsuch, these same qualities stood out. I was very impressed with his disarming nature and ability to talk about issues without necessarily showing bias of his own opinion. Because of all this, I know he will serve as a Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia, that of a balanced judiciary member.  I should also point out that this is not a partisan view point. Conservatives and liberals have come out in support of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation over and over through the past week since his nomination. Neal Katyal, who served as Acting Solicitor General under former President Obama, as a matter of fact, has described Judge Gorsuch as ``an extraordinary judge and man.''  The American Bar Association, which many members of this body hold as a gold standard for judicial nominees, actually gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating--something they don't do very often. They did so unanimously, by the way.  Those who know Judge Gorsuch best, regardless of their political persuasion, have offered ample praise and abiding respect for this well-qualified nominee.  If confirmed, I have full faith that Judge Gorsuch's rulings will be just and rooted in the letter of the law.  This nomination and confirmation come at a time in the history of this Republic when it is absolutely crucial that we have a balanced jurist as the ninth member of the Supreme Jonathan Turley, constitutional law professor at George Washington University right here in Washington, says that this past administration created a constitutional crisis the likes of which our country has never seen. Professor Turley talks about how a President has shown future Presidents a new precedent of how to run the government without Congress by blocking the Senate and actually creating the fourth arm of government--the regulators.  This is a time we have to have a jurist who will bring a balanced view for all Americans to be represented in the Supreme  I am proud to have the opportunity to support this nominee. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to put partisan interest aside, to put the best interest of the country first, and to confirm Neil Gorsuch as the next Justice of the Supreme  I take this as a huge privilege to speak out today, and I will speak more next week on the history of this nomination.

834,topic-id,861,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member and my friend, the chairman of the committee.  We often agree on things in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, but there are times when our disagreements are huge, and this is one of those times.  So, Mr.Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.1430. We have seen this bill in the last Congress, when it was called the Secret Science Reform It was a lousy bill then, and it is still a lousy bill today.  Let's start with the name of this bill, Mr.Speaker, the HONEST Act, but it really should be called the dishonest act. That is because this bill improperly describes what is going on at the EPA, which is looking to protect our environment from extreme weather events that we have in Colorado, throughout the country, and around the world.  The EPA is working to protect our clean air and our clean water, and has demonstrably improved our communities and the health of America since 1970.  I wish I could say these attacks today and tomorrow on the EPA and scientific research are isolated, but unfortunately they are not. Earlier today, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing on climate science. I was astonished at what I heard from the majority Republican Party calling into question whether climate change is happening, and whether it is caused by humans. All this serves is to attack scientific research and jeopardize the progress we have made to combat climate change and protect our communities.  Just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order to further roll back progress that we have made over the last 8 years. The executive order tries to dismantle the Clean Power Plan and many other important protections from the Obama administration which were worked on based on the best available science and through an open and deliberate process, gathering millions of comments along the way. The fact is, investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is good for our national security, good for our environment, and good for jobs.  I believe we can do both--improve our energy independence and create good-paying jobs--at the same time. Colorado has been a leader in reducing harmful emissions, improving energy efficiency, and investing in clean energy, and we have realized substantial economic benefits for Colorado through innovation, research and development, and the creation of good-paying jobs.  Mr.Speaker, we need to do better. This House and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee need to take their heads out of the sand and stop ignoring what is going on across the country and across the world.  I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated March 8, 2017, from the American Geophysical                                   American Geophysical Union,                                                    March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Washington,     Eddie Bernice Johnson,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: On behalf      of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its more than      60,000 members, I am writing to express concerns about the      Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (HONEST      Act) and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.      We encourage you and your colleagues to take additional time      to evaluate the unintended consequences of these bills before      the bills move forward.       Although we appreciate the HONEST Act's protections for      confidential information, we remain concerned about several      provisions in the bill. For example, requirements in the bill      for the use of ``best available science,'' ``data,'' and      ``reproducible'' do not have uniform applications across all      disciplines.       With respect to reproducibility of research, some      scientific research involves longitudinal studies that are so      large and of great duration that they could not realistically      be reproduced. The same may be true for scientific data from      a one-time event (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill)      where the data is gathered in real time. We're concerned that      in these situations the EPA could be constrained from using      important or relevant research in making decisions.       The legislation could also impose costs on recipients of      federal research grants where the research results are      expected to be ``relied on to support a covered action.'' The      bill is not clear on whether it is the EPA's or the research      institution's responsibility to cover the costs associated      with sharing and archiving this information.       We are also troubled by the implications of the EPA Science      Advisory Board Reform As an organization that represents      scientists from broad backgrounds and expertise, we      appreciate the attempt to ensure a diverse panel of      scientific knowledge and perspectives, and support the bill's      goal of increasing accountability and transparency for      scientific advisors. However, because the bill would exclude      some scientists with substantial expertise in their fields      from the Science Advisory Board (SAB), the SAB would suffer      from the exclusion of valuable insight. The purpose of the      SAB is to review the quality and robustness of scientific      data that informs EPA's regulatory process. It is imperative      that the SAB comprise the most expert, independent scientists      and technical advisors to best fulfill that mission.       AGU looks forward to working with you on these critical      issues in the future.

In San Diego, we are a center of genomics, a center of life sciences, and a center of collaborative scientific research that makes groundbreaking discoveries and improves people's lives. In 2015, our research institutions received $768 million in NIH research funding, the most of any metro area in the United We are home to places like the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, the Craig Venter Institute, and the Scripps Research Institute, where world-class scientists are making discoveries that save and improve millions of lives.  At the University of California San Diego, UCSD, the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center is part of a collaborative national effort to better diagnose, prevent, treat, and ultimately to cure Alzheimer's. More than 5 million Americans are living with that disease. Alzheimer's kills more Americans every year than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. It puts a tremendous burden on the family and the loved ones of those battling the disease because for every Alzheimer's patient, there are three people providing unpaid care.  Thanks to organizations like Alzheimer's San Diego, there are services to support families that are providing care for their loved ones. We are grateful for that, but we need to do more.  Alzheimer's also puts a tremendous burden on our healthcare system, as some of the speakers have mentioned. This year, Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the Nation $259 billion. As our population ages, those numbers will only go up. It costs on average $1,150 more per month for a senior with Alzheimer's to reside in assisted living. That puts a financial strain on Medicaid, Medicare, and millions of families.  The research being done at UCSD and around the country is fueled by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on The investments we make in basic scientific research to better understand the disease are our best chance at developing new therapies and ultimately a cure.  One of the most bipartisan victories we have had in Congress since I have been here--this is my third term--was to increase NIH funding and to make a $6.3 billion investment in scientific research, which we did last year. Members of both parties came together with the understanding that NIH funding creates high-paying jobs, grows our economy, and unlocks discovery that changes lives. In his joint address to Congress this year, right here in this room, President Trump said he wanted to find cures to ``free the Earth from the miseries of disease.''  Unfortunately, then he turned around and sent a budget to Congress that slashed funding for NIH, clawing back the progress that we made last year. Our efforts to find cures to diseases like Alzheimer's would be completely undermined by the President's budget. We just can't allow that to happen.

961,topic-id,811,"Mr.President, Michigan is a State that builds things. We invented the auto industry and created a new era of manufacturing. My State saw the American labor movement grow and fight to deliver the 40-hour workweek and safe workplace conditions. In Michigan, we work hard, and after a lifetime of hard work, we expect to be able to retire with dignity.  The American dream can mean different things to different people, but I believe there are some universal elements. We all want our children to prosper and see more opportunity than we have had. While we all need to have a secure retirement, we dream of passing on to the next generation--whether it is a small business or a family farm, a home with the mortgage paid off, or a nest egg that has been built up over many decades. I fear this piece of the American dream--the ability to enjoy a comfortable retirement on the strength of your lifetime earnings--is slipping further and further away for increasing numbers of  The measures we are considering this week, which would repeal the Department of Labor's safe harbor for States and municipalities developing retirement plans, would be a step backwards. Generations ago, Congress heard the American people and agreed that it was simply unacceptable for retired and elderly Americans to live in poverty. The solution that followed was Social Security, perhaps the most effective anti-poverty program ever created.  Today, we must meet that challenge once again. We must preserve and strengthen Social Security, and I will fight for that every day that I am here in the But a modern, comprehensive retirement policy must be more than just a safety net. It must be a ladder to prosperity. A ladder provides a sturdy frame to help people climb and reach new heights, if they are willing to put forth the effort.  Unfortunately, far too many Americans lack access to private savings plans. Traditional defined-benefit plans--the pensions our parents and their parents relied on--are now providing historically low rates. Now, more than ever, expanded access to defined-contribution workplace retirement accounts is critical to our Nation's economic future. Solving the retirement crisis is a complicated puzzle, but one of the most important pieces is access.  Ninety percent of Americans with access to a workplace plan report saving for retirement, while just 20 percent of those without access to a plan say they have saved. Although this difference should be as clear as night and day to everybody, only about half of private sector workers have access to a 401(k) retirement plan. This leaves nearly 60 million Americans without access to a workplace plan. Make no mistake, the numbers are clear. Workers without access are disproportionately low-income and minority workers.  In an effort to address this sweeping problem, States and municipalities have begun work to create their own programs to support retirement savings programs for workers. Recognizing that States are truly the laboratories of democracy, the Obama administration's Department of Labor put forth policies providing safe harbors to States moving forward with these innovative programs.  Today, instead of working on a bipartisan infrastructure package or legislation to support American workers and small businesses, we are debating the use of a fast-track procedure to undo these new policies and make it harder for cities and States to help tackle the retirement savings gap. If a State or city has a good idea that is helping Americans--all Americans--save for retirement, I think that is great. Why are we blocking States from creating innovative solutions? We should allow these programs to move forward so we can help workers responsibly save their hard-earned money. We should also allow these programs to move forward to see what actually works. The Federal Government certainly does not have a monopoly on good ideas, and States and cities cannot be the laboratories of democracy if we tie their hands. We need big ideas, we need small ideas, and, frankly, we need good ideas so we can get to work with what we need to do to solve this incredibly difficult problem.  A secure retirement cannot become a relic of the past. But this foundational piece of the American dream will only be true for this generation of workers[[Page S2092]]if we start working on these solutions now. As our Nation wrestles with growing income inequality, we cannot weaken our ladders to prosperity and pull out the rungs that help hardworking families take the next steps upward. Solving the retirement crisis is about empowering workers to do the right thing for their families and for their future, and repealing these Department of Labor safe harbors will only move us in the wrong direction.

1190,topic-id,499,"Mr.President, I rise to express my opposition to the resolution of disapproval that is currently before the Senate, which would decimate Federal title X funding for healthcare providers across our Nation who provide vital preventive care and family planning services.  Let me put it in simpler terms. Republicans in Congress are once again rushing to advance legislation that will make it harder for Michiganians to get the healthcare they need. Just last week, we saw Speaker Ryan and President Trump in their efforts to take away healthcare from 24 million Americans and to defund Planned Parenthood, but this is a new week, and we are seeing a new assault on healthcare.  Today's resolution is just the latest in a long series of attacks against Planned A vote for this legislation is a vote to make it harder for millions of Americans to access birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.  ``Title X funding'' sounds arcane, but it is actually pretty straightforward. It is a bipartisan program which was established more than 40 years ago and which provides individuals with family planning and preventive health services. Not one penny covers abortion. Let me say that again. Not one penny covers abortion--not one. This is established Federal law, and anyone who says otherwise is simply lying to you or has no idea of what he is talking about.  We should take a step back and ask, what can we agree on here? I think every Senator would agree that we want to reduce unintended pregnancies and teen pregnancies and save money and prevent cancer. Today, unfortunately, we are voting to do the opposite.  Right now, we have the lowest rate of teen pregnancies in our Nation's history, and we are getting ready to heavily restrict a successful program that saves $7 for every public dollar invested. Preventive screenings are quick, affordable, and save lives. Cancer devastates families, ends lives, and is expensive to treat. Historically, low teen pregnancy rates have not happened in a vacuum; they have happened because of concerted efforts to promote education and prevention and give women a say in their own health.  The pain inflicted today will not be felt uniformly; it will disproportionately hurt people in rural and underserved areas in which these clinics are more often than not the primary sources of healthcare. Michigan has 19 Planned Parenthood clinics, and half are located in areas that are federally designated as ``rural and medically underserved.'' As a direct result of title X funds, Michigan family planning clinics prevent over 18,000 unintended pregnancies and over 1,000 cases of sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer each and every year.  Every woman has a fundamental right to make her decisions about her reproductive health. The government has absolutely no right to stand in her way.

The Science Advisory Board's work is important to making sure the EPA considers all scientific information when writing regulations that will impact American farmers, families and small businesses.

25,topic-id,400,"Mr.Speaker, look, first of all, this rather outrageous Republican healthcare bill still will cost 24 million Americans their healthcare insurance; and if you are lucky enough not to be one of those 24 million Americans, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the head of which was appointed by a Republican, says it will also increase the cost by 15 or 20 percent for those who are lucky enough to keep their insurance.[[Page H2381]]  In addition to that, it has a crushing age tax that forces people aged 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than what other Americans pay for health care.  As if that age tax wasn't enough, in this new amendment, which most of us only saw for the first time at 6:30 this morning, they increased the Medicare tax for another 5 years by 1 percent, so Americans will have to pay even more in taxes.

They are not giving the States enough money to maintain those. And then they are saying: But you, States, be the bad guys and you guys make the cut so we in Washington can pat ourselves on the back and look good, even while we increase the deficit by more than $150 billion more than the original healthcare bill that was introduced last week and even though we maintain the age tax that forces people between the age of 50 and 64 to pay up to five times more than other  This is simply the wrong way to go.

If we want to prevent undocumented workers from undermining wages for American workers, immigration reform will do that by making sure that people who work here are registered and get right with the law and can move forward in a legal manner.

481,topic-id,2274,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation. First, when the gentleman from Georgia said there were no amendments brought forward on this in the Rules Committee, that is partial truth but not the entire truth.  The entire truth is, when we have a process whereby Members believe that there might be an amendment process, there is something called a call for amendments which is issued. Often our chair, Mr.Sessions, and my friend from Georgia has heard Mr.Sessions come down to the floor and say: We are calling for amendments on this bill. Submit them. The Rules Committee will consider them and allow some of them to advance to the floor. At least you know you have a fair shot.  In this particular case, there was no call for amendments issued, which means, yes, Members could have spun their wheels, and sometimes you feel like a hamster doing that, just running around and not moving anywhere in one of those circles. And if we thought there was any realistic hope that amendments could be included, I, myself, would have been happy to submit one, as would many of my colleagues.  Chairman Smith actually requested a closed rule on this. So, again, the chairman of the committee and the Rules Committee gave every indication that we are not allowing any amendments to this bill; and that is what discourages Members from going through the work of submitting an amendment if they have a good idea what the outcome is already going to be.  So this is a closed rule. This is an antiscience bill. It is another example of how we go around the ability of Members to improve bills and, instead, work in a partisan, smoky, backroom manner where this bill emerges fully formed. The chair of the committee of jurisdiction himself didn't want any amendments or any changes to this rule, and the Rules Committee never called for those amendments.  Now, if the goal of this bill is somehow to increase government transparency, why don't we start with the lawmaking process and have an open rule that allows Democrats and Republicans to improve a bill and offer their best ideas forward? And if they are good ideas, they will be incorporated into the bill. If they are bad ideas and can't command a majority of this body, they will be defeated.  But, unfortunately, these partisan tactics that were seen trying to ram through legislation last week that failed when the Speaker and the President refused to work across the aisle with us on healthcare reform and now on improving the process at the EPA, instead of working with us to improve science, they are seeking to undermine the integrity of the important scientific work done at the Environmental Protection Agency and bury the Environmental Protection Agency in red tape.  The underlying legislation that this rule talks about has a lot of problems, Mr.Speaker, and so many problems, in fact, I won't even be able to talk about them all during my limited time for debate here. Hopefully they will be able to cover some more during the debate on the bill.  The first issue I want to address that is highly problematic with this bill, and it is something that is so important to the American people--liberal, conservative, and moderate--and that is the issue of privacy.  This bill would undermine the privacy of American families in a number of ways. What it would do is prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency that exists to protect our health, from taking any action unless it is based on data that is fully available to the public. Now, that sounds good, ``fully available to the public.'' But what does that mean?  You see, normally the EPA has relied on peer-reviewed, scientifically valid research to inform its actions. Now that is something that the process of science across the world informs. It is a very important, well-founded process that respects the efforts of scientists everywhere and the diligence of a peer-reviewed process.  Much of these bodies of work utilize personal health information and confidential data which, currently, are legally protected from public disclosure. The EPA identifies the academic papers that it uses in the Federal Register so we have that transparency, but it doesn't release the legally protected private data--participants in studies, health of people--to the general public nor is there any scientific value to that personal information.  The value is in the studies, which are done scientifically and are already made public. This bill would force the EPA to either ignore these valuable studies because they utilize private[[Page H2473]]data or violate Federal law by sharing confidential patient information with the general public. We are talking about everything ranging from Social Security numbers, to whether you got cancer from something you were drinking as a child, to our most intimate health or lifestyle issues that are researched by the agency.  The majority here, the Republicans, are trying to include a provision in the bill that allows personally identifiable information to be redacted prior to the EPA making the information available. I am sure my colleague from Georgia will cite that, but that is woefully inefficient because it has a loophole in that very provision that basically negates that provision in another section by allowing the EPA administrator to allow any person who signs a confidentiality agreement to have access to all the redacted data.  So, again, basically, at the whim of the administrator, they can allow companies and people in there--the information can be put in front of people who have access to it, to use it in any way they want, and that is highly personal information.  Again, whether it is under the coverage of a confidentiality agreement or not, it is shown with unknown partners. This is not the Federal agency itself. This is perhaps even the company that caused the pollution that wants to come in and look at it or just various Americans with prurient interests who want to know intimate health details, and there is effectively no protection for that. It is entirely at the whim of the administrator of the Environmental Protection  So that is an enormous setback for the privacy of American families and a woefully insufficient privacy protection with a loophole that is big enough to drive a truck through. There is not even a numerical limit on the amount of people or corporations that would be allowed access of that data. There could be a blanket permission from the administrator allowing thousands, tens of thousands of people, again, to see the individually identifiable data, including your Social Security Number, including your health details or medical records, including things that affect property value and affect health.  Another major issue with this bill, major fault, is it actually undermines the goal of the Agency itself. The Environmental Protection Agency, which has the congressional mandate to keep our air and water clean, to protect our health, this bill actually does the opposite by burying the Agency under a mountain of red tape and bureaucracy.  This bill removes sound, scientific, objective decisionmaking and replaces it with ridiculous amounts of red tape, adding to the process of regulations, adding to the process of rules, requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to jump through additional bureaucratic hoops to use certain information, and making their entire goal of fulfilling their mission less efficient than if this bill were not the law.  The Environmental Protection Agency already uses a peer-reviewed scientific process. They publish in the Federal Register the reference of the works that they are basing their opinions on, just as the rest of America's scientific community does. This bill undermines the scientific process, is unscientific, and is opposed by so many scientific advocacy organizations, including opposed by the Union of Concerned Scientists who are strongly opposed to this legislation.  Now, on top of the red tape and antiscience aspects of the bill, this would also cost the government $1 billion of EPA funds; that is according to analysis of a very similar bill last These are funds that would be diverted away from protecting our health and safety, which is what they are doing now, toward creating more red tape and bureaucracy for the very agency that the American people entrust with the goal of keeping our air and water clean and the American people healthy.  Look, we all know what this bill is. It is a thinly veiled attack on science, part of the antiscience agenda that we are seeing from the Republican  The budget that the President offered earlier this month cuts science funding to the bone. Enormous setbacks in the very research into lifesaving science in the future that would help improve our quality of life and duration of life and help our economy boom are being devastated under the President's budgets.  Scientific research creates billions of dollars of economic impact and innovation in States like mine, Colorado, and every other Science helps keep us healthy. It keeps crops alive and productive. It keeps our businesses open and keeps America as a global leader in innovation.  I also want to take a moment to highlight that, while this bill is being heard on the floor today, President Trump is signing an executive order that effectively repeals all of the work that the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies have done in the last 8 years to protect our planet from the impacts of climate change.  Unfortunately, while we focus on a bill that forces scientists to not use the best science available, the President has signed an executive order that will essentially begin the repeal process of the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan is a basic requirement for States to bring their emissions down to a sustainable level to protect Americans' health, to reduce the amount of pollution in our air and water, and to reduce the human impact on climate change.  The executive order also, unfortunately, undermines some of the commonsense protections we have with regard to fracking, something that is near and dear to my constituents and people in Colorado, as an area that is impacted by extraction activities.  This repeal, for example, would allow oil and gas companies to hide the chemicals that they use when producing oil and natural gas. Picture that: fracking wells near homes and schools who would no longer have to report what chemicals could potentially be leaking into drinking water or groundwater. How can that possibly further our goal to protect the health and welfare of the American people?  So, at the same time, we have this legislation undermining the scientific process of the Environmental Protection Agency and burying the Environmental Protection Agency under red tape, coordinated the same week with the President's disastrous executive order that will hurt the health of the American people and, ultimately, cost lives.  These are just another step in the undermining of science and the work to improve and protect the health of the people of our country. The Environmental Protection Agency relies on the best science available when developing new standards, and they are fully transparent about posting those scientific studies.  However, because many of the studies that this bill requires would impact legally protected private data, like personal medical records, to reach their findings, the Environmental Protection Agency could even be prohibited from considering that research.  This ridiculous restriction would force the EPA to ignore a lot of relevant information because of the desire of the researchers and the legal imperative of the researchers to protect the private data of the participants, ultimately leading to policies that are ineffective and are not based on sound facts or science.  Mr.Speaker, facts exist. Science and the pursuit of truth is an incredibly important human endeavor, and we can't afford to disregard that quest for truth in the name of a fiction-based reality that we increasingly seem to be headed toward as a nation.  Without sound and strong science, America will fall behind in the world. Americans will--our lifespans will be of lower quality and lower duration, and our economy will be hurt as we cede our leadership role to more forward-looking countries willing to invest in the future.  If this bill had been in place over the last few decades, I am pretty sure that the cloud of smog over Denver, Colorado, would probably still be there. Rivers and lakes across this country would suffer from pollution in a significantly worse way, and that is not the future that the American people want.  If the EPA is prevented from using the best available peer-reviewed research data on air quality, asthma will be causing more attacks and, yes, even deaths of children across our country.  Let's see this legislation for what it is--an attack on science, a giveaway to corporations who benefit from pollution, who don't like the fact that the EPA is using sound silence, who want to create and live in their own fictional[[Page H2474]]reality, where the externalities of their actions somehow don't matter.  We need the truth. The American people deserve the truth. We deserve the benefit of the outcome of the process of objective science, and this bill undermines that by burying the Environmental Protection Agency under immense red tape, while preventing them from using some of the very peer-reviewed studies that would lead to the very best decisionmaking possible to protect the health of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2471-5.txt,1910,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,March
483,topic-id,978,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have some scoring from the Congressional Budget Office, dated March 11, 2015, that I include into the              H.1030--Secret Science Reform Act of 2015   As ordered reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and                       Technology on March 3, 2015                                SUMMARY       H.1030 would amend the Environmental Research,      Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to      prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from      proposing, finalizing, or disseminating a ``covered action''      unless all scientific and technical information used to      support that action is publicly available in a manner that is      sufficient for independent analysis and substantial      reproduction of research results. Covered actions would      include assessments of risks, exposure, or hazards; documents      specifying criteria, guidance, standards, or limitations; and      regulations and regulatory impact statements.       Although H.1030 would not require EPA to disseminate any      scientific or technical information that it relies on to      support covered actions, the bill would not prohibit EPA from      doing so. Based on information from EPA, CBO expects that EPA      would spend $250 million annually over the next few years to      ensure the transparency of information and data supporting      some covered actions.       Enacting H.1030 would not affect direct spending or      revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.      H.1030 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       This legislation would direct EPA to implement H.1030      using up to $1 million a year from amounts authorized to be      appropriated for other activities under current law. Although      H.1030 would not authorize additional appropriations to      implement the requirements of the bill, CBO estimates that      implementing H.1030 would cost about $250 million a year      for the next few years, subject to appropriation of the      necessary amounts. Costs in later years would probably      decline gradually from that level. The additional      discretionary spending would cover the costs of expanding the      scope of EPA studies and related activities such as data      collection and database construction for all of the      information necessary to meet the legislation's requirements.                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE       Under current law, EPA typically spends about $500 million      each year to support research and development activities,      including assessments to determine the potential risk to      public health from environmental contaminants. The number of      studies involved in supporting covered actions depends on the      complexity of the issue being addressed. For example, when      addressing a recent issue with flaring at petroleum      refineries, EPA relied on a dozen scientific studies. In      contrast, when reviewing the National Ambient Air Quality      Standards, the agency relied on thousands of scientific      studies. In total, the agency relies on about 50,000      scientific studies annually to perform its mission--although      some of those studies are used more than once from year to      year.       The costs of implementing H.1030 are uncertain because      it is not clear how EPA would meet the bill's requirements.      Depending on their size and scope, the new activities called      for by the bill would cost between $10,000 and $30,000 for      each scientific study used by the agency. If EPA continued to      rely on as many scientific studies as it has used in recent      years, while increasing the collection and dissemination of      all the technical[[Page H2475]]     information used in such studies as directed by H.1030,      then implementing the bill would cost at least several      hundred million dollars a year. However, EPA could instead      rely on significantly fewer studies each year in support of      its mission, and limit its spending on data collection and      database construction activities to a relatively small      expansion of existing study-related activity; in that      scenario, implementing the bill would be much less costly.       Thus, the costs of implementing H.1030 would ultimately      depend on how EPA adapts to the bill's requirements. (It      would also depend on the availability of appropriated funds      to conduct the additional data collection and database      construction activities and related coordination and      reporting activities under the legislation.) CBO expects that      EPA would modify its practices, at least to some extent, and      would base its future work on fewer scientific studies, and      especially those studies that have easily accessible or      transparent data. Any such modification of EPA practices      would also have to take into consideration the concern that      the quality of the agency's work could be compromised if that      work relies on a significantly smaller collection of      scientific studies; we expect that the agency would seek to      reduce its reliance on numerous studies without sacrificing      the quality of the agency's covered actions related to      research and development.       On balance--recognizing the significant uncertainty      regarding EPA's potential actions under the bill--CBO expects      that the agency would probably cut the number of studies it      relies on by about one-half and that the agency would aim to      limit the costs of new activities required by the bill, such      as data collection, correspondence and coordination with      study authors, construction of a database to house necessary      information, and public dissemination of such information. As      a result, CBO estimates the incremental costs to the agency      would be around $250 million a year initially, subject to      appropriation of the necessary amounts. In our assessment      that figure lies near the middle of a broad range of possible      outcomes under H.1030. CEO expects that the additional      costs to implement the legislation would decline over time as      EPA became more adept and efficient at working with authors      and researchers to ensure that the data used to support      studies are provided in a standardized and replicable form.                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS                    InTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT       H.1030 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets      of state, local, or tribal governments.

It really doesn't make any sense to talk about people worshipping the We respect the scientific work of the EPA, and maybe this confusion between faith and science is what is leading to the undermining of the scientific aspects that the EPA reaches their conclusions on.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that shows the strong opposition from those who advocate for our health against this bill. Alliance of Nurses, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, National Medical Association, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and others have all signed a letter in opposition to this bill because this bill threatens the health of the American people.                                                   March 27, 2017.       Dear Representative: The undersigned health and medical      organizations are writing to express our opposition to the      EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest      and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our      organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving      public health.       Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health      decision-making. The best science undergirds everything our      organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act,      EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for      seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on      standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these      bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the      review of complex issues and add undue industry influence      into EPA's decision-making process.       As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would      make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:       Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that      include their own expertise;       Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on      the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the      expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them      these highly competitive grants;       Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making      policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have      regularly sought their advice in the past;       Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA      Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and      unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues      already include public notice and comment; and       Reallocate membership requirements to increase the      influence of industry representatives on the scientific      advisory panels.       In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit      the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to      respond to important questions, and increase the influence of      industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best      interest of the American public.       We also have concerns with the HONEST This legislation      would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it      develops policy to protect the American public from      environmental exposures and permit violation of patient      confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would:       Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient      information to third parties, including industry;       Bolster industry's flawed arguments to discredit research      that documents the adverse health effects of environmental      pollution; and       Impose new standards for the publication and distribution      of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing      requirements of many scientific journals.       Science, developed by the respected men and women      scientists at colleges and universities across the United      States, has always been the foundation of the nation's      environmental policy. EPA's science-based decision-making      process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in      the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the      earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the      research-based scientific advice that scientists have      provided to       Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists,      not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA's      decision-making or give polluters a disproportionate voice in      EPA's policy-setting process.

If the gentleman from Georgia has any evidence that this bill will cost less, I encourage him to bring it forward.  This bill, frankly, would force the EPA to be dishonest, to not use the best available science, and threaten the privacy of the American people.  Our goal should be to help the agencies that we charge with protecting our health to use the best possible science to do the best possible job that they can. We should not be throwing up roadblocks and red tape and bureaucratic mazes that hurt the quality of work and the science that we base our protections on.  We need to protect American lives from things like dirty air, dirty water, and pollution.

That is simply not on the minds of the American people.  What is on the minds of the American people is that we need a full accounting for the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is why we have a bill to create a bipartisan commission to investigate that Russian interference in a manner that has credibility with the American people, that can end this increasingly bizarre spy novel that seems to be unfolding in this city that we are meeting in now, and replace it with investigations and facts and a full accounting for the American people as to what happened and who was involved.

513,topic-id,1635,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the resolution.  This resolution undermines fundamental privacy for every internet user. You hear my colleague on the other side trying to conflate different things. When your broadband provider can sell your information, and there is no rule prohibiting them from doing so--effectively that includes all of your browsing history, data entered in forms, everything that you have done on the internet that has absolutely nothing to do with a relationship with a particular content provider or e-commerce company; you can enter information, obviously, for the express purpose of them optimizing your experience or selling you a product--they are then the owners of that information, and you have choice in the marketplace. Whereas, with our broadband providers, most of us don't have a choice. You either sign up for the local cable company or you don't.  Before I discuss the many disastrous facets of this resolution, I also want to point out that this is yet another closed rule. There have been absolutely no open rules that allow Democrats and Republicans to bring forward amendments. No amendments are allowed under this rule here on the floor of the House of Sadly, that has become the norm.  The FCC recently took steps to reevaluate their rule. Commissioner Pai even paused their implementation to examine the FCC doing their job.[[Page H2481]]  Now, why would Congress step in and use the CRA authority, a very cumbersome authority, that also prohibits future implementation of similar rules?  In many ways, it hamstrings the agency.  What we are worried about is that, if this bill were to become law, it would essentially be impossible for the FCC to act to protect the privacy of Americans who use broadband ever again. So it is not a matter of a nuance under this rule. If we go through the process of passing a CRA, the FCC wouldn't be able to pass any rule--or if they did, it would be under a legal cloud--to protect the privacy of the American people. That is the danger: that CRAs are effectively permanent.  The second aspect is that the FCC has already established a notice and comment period that allows for comment on the new rules. By going around that, we would avoid government transparency.  So here is what is at stake. On October 27, 2016, after a 6-month rulemaking process that was open to public comment and received comments, the FCC developed a commonsense rule to protect our privacy. The rule that we are talking about undoing basically does three things, which are great.  It requires broadband internet access service providers to obtain opt-in consent before using or sharing sensitive information. Sounds obvious that we would want that. We wouldn't want information that doesn't have an opt-in consent to be sold or used. That includes things like web browsing history or data that is entered on forms.  It would also require broadband providers to use reasonable measures to protect the cybersecurity of our data. Again, of course.  Third, it requires that broadband providers notify consumers in the event of a breach of information. Again, just like we have with credit card companies, we want some kind of affirmative information that is given to consumers that your information may be breached if there is a cybersecurity threat that might do that.  This bill undoes all those things. It says that you don't have to notify people if there is a breach, you don't need to have reasonable measures to protect cybersecurity, and, most importantly, with regard to privacy, it will no longer require opt-in consent before using, sharing, or selling your most intimate personal data that you use on the internet.  Now, look at the implications of this rollback. It is not just a collection of internet data usage, but bulk collection of all of your network traffic. A broadband provider could collect every search, every website visited, every email written and received, every piece of data entered, every article read, see how often you log in and how you use various accounts for all members of your family, including minors, and even your location, sell that information, and use that information without restriction and without opt-in.  Think about what someone can conclude about this information--your political affiliation, preferences, your health.  What could they do with it?  They could charge pricing of goods and services discriminating against you based on your income or your past purchasing behavior. Your sensitive financial information could be used to steer you to higher costs and worse financial products. This rule would literally change how broadband providers have access to your entire personal life. It would make the broadband providers the most valuable part of the internet value chain.  Now, we all want broadband providers to have compensation for the infrastructure costs and a reasonable profit. There is no doubt about that. Those of us who advocate for net neutrality, as I do, or those who advocate for privacy, we want them to have a reasonable return on investment so that we can all have access to broadband. And we have that largely through user fees and subscription fees.  Have you seen your cable bill, Mr.Speaker?  I have seen my cable bill. It ain't cheap anymore. But many families pay for it because it is the best way to have fast access to the internet.  And guess what?  The cable companies are able to justify broadband in many areas.  Again, maybe there are some tweaks, and it would be great if there is a way we could have greater value for rural broadband and have them have an We would love that. But the answer is not to turn over the keys to the internet and all your personal data to cable companies and say: You own it all. You are more powerful than Amazon, more powerful than Google, more powerful than every consumer site because you own everything that is entered into every one of those and more, and you can sell it and use it as you see fit without restriction, without even requiring that users opt in.  The value conveyance from the content side to the infrastructure side of this bill would be game-changing and game-destroying for the free and open internet. It simply makes no sense.  Look, consumers should have the right to choose with who and how they share their personal information. When it comes to a broadband provider, we simply don't have that choice that you do with consumer websites like Facebook or Google, which are governed under a separate set of laws.  Proponents of this bill are arguing that, because there is not adequate protection somehow in social media and the edge providers here, somehow the standard should be lower for broadband internet services. It makes no sense. In today's day and age, not having internet access is simply not an option for many To say you can choose not to have broadband, maybe in some places you can pay more for satellite and you might have some reasonably fast download but not upload that may be spotty, maybe you want to use dial-in over your phone. But for most of us--I use broadband. Most of us use broadband through our cable because it is the most cost-effective way to have high-speed internet access, and that is the case for most American families.  So this is not the time to get rid of privacy rules and convey the vast ecosystem that is the internet away from the content and dynamism that exists there to the broadband side. That is absurd.  People can choose not to use social media accounts, can choose what they share, and can choose who to enter contracts with with regard to searches or purchases. Social media is an optional platform that you can choose between many providers, but the broadband access side frequently looks and acts more like a monopoly.  Supporters of this bill also mention how this somehow levels the playing field for broadband providers. What it does is it tilts the playing field entirely in their favor. Internet service providers are a gateway to the internet. They do not own the internet.  The second protection the rule offers is to require reasonable measures be taken to protect the data that they want to collect. Again, we all value cybersecurity and protection of this data. Given the countless incidents of cyber hacking incidents, how can we entertain the idea of rolling back a rule that requires reasonable measures to protect consumer data? What are proponents advocating for? No measures to protect consumer data?  The third important protection under this rule is the consumers whose data has been breached should be notified. Again, that is important. I had my credit card stolen a few years ago and got notified that it was. I used it at another location where it might have been compromised and I received notification. This eliminates that notification from users of broadband. It would do away with that.  I would like to know, as would consumers, if my credit card information was hacked. I want to know if my personal profile or medical records or emails were hacked. If someone is able to attain my children's names, our home address, information about the schools they attend, or the homework they do, I would want to know.  Now, look, this bill moves entirely the wrong direction. It basically seizes the value of the internet from content, from e-commerce, from all of the important dynamism that occurs there and tries to apply that to the broadband side rather than simply find a reasonable way for broadband providers to see a return on investment.

527,topic-id,2406,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is no surprise that nobody wants to come to the floor and talk in favor of this bill because it is such an awful bill. This bill would allow your broadband provider of internet services to sell all of your personal information.  So, again, the other side is trying to conflate two entirely different things. When you do a transaction within an e-commerce site or search site, you are agreeing to their terms of service, and you are engaging in a discrete transaction, and the information that you enter is subject to their terms of use--completely appropriate. A competitor is only a click away.  Whether there are any monopolistic content providers is a different matter for a different day, and a different Federal agency--the What we are talking about here is the access piece, the broadband access piece. They actually, through the pipes, get to see all of the information that is entered that you see: every email; all of your credit card information; if you use the internet for any personal medical research, all of your personal medical research; your kids' information, everything your kids and minors in the family do. And what this bill says is: you don't have to require people to opt in to have their information used.  Consumers should be in control of their own information. They shouldn't be forced to sell and give that information to who knows who simply for the price of admission for access to the internet.  Again, we all want there to be a reasonable capital return on infrastructure and on broadband. That is something we can agree on. If there is a case to be made that we can do better in providing an economic return to encourage rural broadband, I am for it. I know many of my colleagues on the other side would be for it. Let's do it.  What we don't want to do in that process is turn over the entire value chain of the internet to the infrastructure and provider side, rather than the dynamic innovative content and e-commerce side.  I would like to read an excerpt from two letters from groups who are opposed to this bill. The first is a coalition of 19 media, justice, consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups.  Their concern that: ``Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer information at will. The result could be extensive harm caused by breaches or misuse of data.''  They remind us that: ``The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their personal information and lets them choose the terms on which ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it.''  Consumers should be in control of their own information.  The second letter is from Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer They say, in part, that this bill ``would strip consumers of their privacy rights and . . . leave them with no protections at all.''  I include in the Record those two letters, Mr.                                                January 27, 2017.

That order      implements the mandates in Section 222 of the 1996      Telecommunications Act, which an overwhelming, bipartisan      majority of Congress enacted to protect telecommunications      users' privacy. The cable, telecom, wireless, and advertising      lobbies request for CRA intervention is just another industry      attempt to overturn rules that empower users and give them a      say in how their private information may be used.       Not satisfied with trying to appeal the rules of the      agency, industry lobbyists have asked Congress to punish      internet users by way of restraining the FCC, when all the      agency did was implement Congress' own directive in the 1996      This irresponsible, scorched-earth tactic is as harmful      as it is hypocritical. If Congress were to take the industry      up on its request, a Resolution of Disapproval could exempt      internet service providers (ISPs) from any and all privacy      rules at the As you know, a successful CRA on the      privacy rules could preclude the FCC from promulgating any      ``substantially similar'' regulations in the future--in      direct conflict with Congress' clear intention in Section 222      that telecommunications carriers protect their customers'      privacy. It could also preclude the FCC from addressing any      of the other issues in the privacy order like requiring data      breach notification and from revisiting these issues as      technology continues to evolve in the future. The true      consequences of this revoked authority are apparent when      considering the ISPs' other efforts to undermine the rules.      Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer      information at will. The result could be extensive harm      caused by breaches or misuse of data.       Broadband ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers      to everything on the internet, have a largely unencumbered      view into their customers' online communications. That      includes the websites they visit, the videos they watch, and      the messages they send. Even when that traffic is encrypted,      ISPs can gather vast troves of valuable information on their      users' habits; but researchers have shown that much of the      most sensitive information remains unencrypted.       The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their      personal information and lets them choose the terms on which      ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it. Americans are      increasingly concerned about their privacy, and in some cases      have begun to censor their online activity for fear their      personal information may be compromised. Consumers have      repeatedly expressed their desire for more privacy      protections and their belief that the government helps ensure      those protections are met. The FCC's rules give broadband      customers confidence that their privacy and choices will be      honored, but it does not in any way ban ISPs' ability to      market to users who opt-in to receive any such targeted      offers.       The ISPs' overreaction to the FCC's broadband privacy rules      has been remarkable. Their supposed concerns about the rule      are significantly overblown. Some broadband providers and      trade associations inaccurately suggest that this rule is a      full ban on data use and disclosure by ISPs, and from there      complain that it will hamstring ISPs' ability to compete with      other large advertising companies and platforms like Google      and To the contrary, ISPs can and likely will      continue to be able to benefit from use and sharing of their      customers' data, so long as those customers consent to such      uses. The rules merely require the ISPs to obtain that      informed consent.       The ISPs and their trade associations already have several      petitions for reconsideration of the privacy rules before the      Their petitions argue that the FCC should either adopt a      ``Federal Trade Commission style'' approach to broadband      privacy, or that it should retreat from the field and its      statutory duty in favor of the Federal Trade Commission      itself. All of these suggestions are fatally flawed. Not only      is the FCC well positioned to continue in its statutorily      mandated role as the privacy watchdog for broadband telecom      customers, it is the only agency able to do so. As the 9th      Circuit recently decided in a case brought by AT&T, common      carriers are entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction, meaning      that presently there is no privacy replacement for broadband      customers waiting at the FTC if Congress disapproves the      FCC's rules here.       This lays bare the true intent of these industry groups,      who also went to the FCC asking for fine-tuning and      reconsideration of the rules before they sent their CRA      request. These groups now ask Congress to create a vacuum and      to give ISPs carte blanche, with no privacy rules or      enforcement in place. Without clear rules of the road under      Section 222, broadband users will have no certainty about how      their private information can be used and no protection      against its abuse. ISPs could and would use and disclose      consumer information at will, leading to extensive harm      caused by breaches and by misuse of data properly belonging      to consumers.       Congress told the FCC in 1996 to ensure that      telecommunications carriers protect the information they      collect about their customers. Industry groups now ask      Congress to ignore the mandates in the Communications Act,      enacted with strong bipartisan support, and overturn the      FCC's attempts to implement Congress's word. The CRA is a      blunt instrument and it is inappropriate in this instance,      where rules clearly benefit internet users notwithstanding      ISPs' disagreement with them.[[Page H2484]]       We strongly urge you to oppose any resolution of      disapproval that would overturn the FCC's broadband privacy      rule.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and      mobilization arm of Consumer Reports, writes regarding House      consideration of S.34, approved by a 50-48 party line      vote in the Senate last week.       This resolution, if passed by the House and signed into law      by President, would use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to      nullify the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) newly-     enacted broadband privacy rules that give consumers better      control over their data. Many Senators cited ``consumer      confusion'' as a reason to do away with the FCC's privacy      rules, but we have seen no evidence proving this assertion      and fail to understand how taking away increased privacy      protections eliminates confusion. Therefore, we strongly      oppose passage of this resolution--it would strip consumers      of their privacy rights and, as we explain below, leave them      with no protections at all. We urge you to vote no on S.     34.       The FCC made history last October when it adopted consumer-     friendly privacy rules that give consumers more control over      how their information is collected by internet service      providers (ISPs). Said another way, these rules permit      consumers to decide when an ISP can collect a treasure trove      of consumer information, whether it is a web browsing history      or the apps a consumer may have on a smartphone. We believe      the rules are simple, reasonable, and straightforward.       ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to      everything on the internet, enjoy a unique window into      consumers' online activities. Data including websites      consumers visit, videos viewed, and messages sent is very      valuable. Small wonder, then, that ISPs are working so hard      to have the FCC's new privacy rules thrown out through use of      the Congressional Review But we should make no mistake:      abandoning the FCC's new privacy rules is about what benefits      big cable companies and not about what is best for consumers.       Many argue the FCC should have the same privacy rules as      those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman      Ajit Pai went so far as to say ``jurisdiction over broadband      providers' privacy and data security practices should be      returned to the FTC, the nation's expert agency with respect      to these important subjects,'' even though the FTC currently      possesses no jurisdiction over the vast majority of ISPs      thanks to the common carrier exemption--an exemption made      stricter by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in last year's      AT&T Mobility case. We have heard this flawed logic time and      time again as one of the principal arguments for getting rid      of the FCC's strong privacy rules. Unfortunately, this is      such a poor solution that it amounts to no solution at all.       For the FTC to regain jurisdiction over the privacy      practices of ISPs, the FCC would first have to scrap Title II      reclassification--not an easy task which would be both time-     consuming and subject to judicial review, and jeopardize the      legal grounding of the 2015 Open Internet Congress, in      turn, would have to pass legislation to remove the common      carrier exemption, thus granting the FTC jurisdiction over      those ISPs who are common carriers. We are skeptical Congress      would take such an action. Finally, the FTC does not enjoy      the same robust rulemaking authority that the FCC does. As a      result, consumers would have to wait for something bad to      happen before the FTC would step in to remedy a violation of      privacy rights. Any fondness for the FTC's approach to      privacy is merely support for dramatically weaker privacy      protections favored by most corporations.       There is no question that consumers favor the FCC's current      broadband privacy rules. Consumers Union launched an online      petition drive last month in support of the Commission's      strong rules. To date, close to 50,000 consumers have signed      the petition and the number is growing. Last week, more than      24,000 consumers contacted their Senators urging them to      oppose the CRA resolution in the 24 hours leading up to the      vote. Consumers care about privacy and want the strong      privacy protections afforded to the them by the Any      removal or watering down of those rules would represent the      destruction of simple privacy protections for consumers.       Even worse, if this resolution is passed, using the      Congressional Review Act here will prevent the FCC from      adopting privacy rules--even weaker ones--to protect      consumers in the future. Under the CRA, once a rule is      erased, an agency cannot move forward with any      ``substantially similar'' rule unless Congress enacts new      legislation specifically authorizing it. Among other impacts,      this means a bare majority in the Senate can void a rule, but      then restoration of that rule is subject to full legislative      process, including a filibuster. The CRA is a blunt      instrument--and if used in this context, blatantly anti-     consumer.       We are more than willing to work with you and your fellow      Representatives to craft privacy legislation that affords      consumer effective and easy-to-understand protections. The      FCC made a step in that direction when it adopted the      broadband privacy rules last year, and getting rid of them      via the Congressional Review Act is a step back, not forward.      Therefore, we encourage you to vote no on S.34.

528,topic-id,483,"I also include in the Record an op-ed that I had the opportunity to publish last week on this topic. My piece is entitled ``Why Americans should be worried about their online broadband privacy,'' talking about this very bill that Congress has the tenacity to try to bring to the floor under this rule to force the most personal information pieces of information about every aspect of your internet behavior, and that of your family members, to be given to the broadband provider to do whatever they want with.               [From the Huffington Post, March 22, 2017] Why Americans Should Be Worried About Their Online, Broadband Privacy                            (By Jared Polis)       Over the last couple of months, the dialogue surrounding      government surveillance and consumer privacy has shifted in a      troubling direction. While news outlets are covering      everything from false claims of wiretaps to outlandish claims      of reconnaissance microwaves, Republicans are quietly taking      real and dramatic steps to protect corporate profits at the      cost of your privacy. A few weeks ago, Senator Jeff Flake (R-     Ariz.) and Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) filed      bills in both the House of Representatives and the Senate      that, if passed, will permanently eliminate broadband users'      privacy protections, affecting nearly everyone who uses the            The legislation allows broadband providers to access and      sell consumers' information without their permission. As our      gateway to the Internet, Broadband Internet Service      Providers--commonly referred to as ISPs--have access to a      wealth of personal information, from our physical location to      our shopping habits and the medical issues we research--can      reveal potentially sensitive details about our personal      lives.       Every search, every website visited, every article read      online, see how often you log into and use your various      online accounts and even, in some cases, collect your      location. Think about what someone could conclude from this      information about you--your overall health, risk activity,      political affiliation, preferences. What could they do with      that information? Could they change pricing of goods and      services depending on your income and past purchasing      behaviors? Could you face challenges obtaining insurance due      to perceptions on your health or risk behavior based on your      search activity? This rule change will literally allow      broadband providers to have access to your entire personal      life on a network and sell it.       After years of advocating for further consumer protections,      in October 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)      took a responsible and commonsense step to establish      broadband privacy protections--but only months later      Republicans are trying to roll back the progress made and      repeal the existing rules, fighting alongside corporate      broadband providers.       The legislation is unnecessary, as the FCC has already      taken steps to review the rules, pausing implementation to      conduct a careful examination of the complexities of      implementation. The Republican legislation, would stop this      process, bypass public comment, and eliminate the privacy      protections permanently and irrevocably.       That is why I am drawing attention to this critical issue,      before it's too late.

529,topic-id,275,"Like these groups, I also believe that privacy is worth defending. In the wrong hands, information can be damaging and used for the wrong reasons.  Simply put, this bill is about conveying the value of the internet to the infrastructure side rather than the content side. And rather than finding common ground to establish reasonable ROI for broadband and internet investments, this bill would hurt the entire internet ecosystem by breaking down the trust between consumers and service providers.  What they are really trying to do here is shift the reasonable burden for cybersecurity measures from the internet servers onto consumers. At the[[Page H2485]]same time, they want to eliminate the requirements of cybersecurity measures, even notify consumers of violations, and they want to collect more and more consumer data without any protections to do what they want with.  Supporting this bill would make each and every user of the internet vulnerable to violations of our privacy and vulnerable to cybersecurity threats without even receiving notifications of when our own intimate information, like credit card numbers, is compromised.  The FCC took a responsible, deliberate, and commonsense step to establish broadband privacy protections in October 2016. If they need to be tweaked or changed, let's have a process to do that. This bill is not that process. It not only undoes those privacy protections but prevents the FCC from ever issuing a rule that has those privacy protections in it.  Mr.Speaker, if passed, this bill would be an irrevocable step in the wrong direction. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

695,topic-id,1643,"Mr.President, first I want to thank my colleague for coming to the floor today to speak about Montenegro and the importance of its accession into NATO, as well as for his focus on the Balkans and for his comment that right now the people of the Balkans and, for that matter, the people in Ukraine and other countries in eastern Southern Europe are feeling a lot of pressure. I applaud him for working on a bipartisan basis over the last couple of years to help us push back against some of the disinformation and propaganda that is primarily being promoted by  In each of these countries--and I know my colleague Senator Murphy has visited these countries--the first issue I hear about when I go on a trip to Latvia, where I went recently, and certainly Ukraine and even Poland is concern about this sort of unrelenting campaign of disinformation, as we call it; maybe the other term would be ``propaganda.'' We do need to stand up and be counted. The new department of global engagement at the State Department is beginning to do that. I know Senator Murphy has had some meetings recently--and I have, too--where they are starting to get their feet on the ground and being able to allow people to be able to see the objective truth; in other words, to sort of separate narratives from reality, to be able to ensure that we don't have an undermining of these great democracies--these fledgling democracies, many of them.  So we are talking today, as my colleague from Nebraska did earlier, about the meddling in our own election here and the effect it is having on the level of trust in this country, and this is true not just here but in other democracies. I appreciate Senator Murphy standing up and being counted on that issue and then today specifically being able to help Montenegro to have the opportunity to develop its own institutions. As I said, it is not perfect, but they have made progress, they have made reforms, and they have followed the directions many of us have given them to enable them to be responsible members of So I thank Senator Murphy for being here today and talking about that.                            Read Aloud Month  Mr.President, I am actually speaking out today about another issue, which is one that is a little closer to home, and that is about the importance of reading to our kids. It turns out that this month of March has been designated as Read Aloud Month, and this group called Read Aloud is doing fantastic work around the country. They actually started in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, so I am a little biased about them, but what they are doing is incredibly important. It is about education, it is about the economy, and more importantly, it is about the lives of young people around the country and the ability to achieve their dreams. It is about child literacy.  Here is the information. Elementary schools and libraries are talking about this more and more back home. If you read to your kids when they are young, they will have a much better chance of succeeding in life. According to a study that dates back to 1995--kind of a famous study--by the time a child born into poverty reaches age 3, he or she has heard 30 million fewer words than his or her peers. Let me repeat that. A kid who is born into poverty is going to hear 30 million fewer words by the time he or she is 3 years old. Why does that matter? Why does this word gap, as they call it, matter? Well, it matters because it turns out these verbal skills, like other skills, develop as they are used, and if they are not used, they don't develop. So a lot of kids who already have the challenge of growing up in poverty are also burdened with the disadvantage of not developing these verbal skills. That makes it harder for them to get good grades, harder for them to develop social skills, and harder for them to get a good job and ultimately to be able to live out their dreams.  I know Washington, DC, may be the only place on Earth where 30 million sounds like a small number, but it is a big number. It makes a huge difference. This word gap leads to an achievement gap later in life based on all the studies. Experts tell us that a child's vocabulary is reflective of his or her parents' vocabulary. It makes sense. Kids learn what they see and what they hear.  There is a 2003 study by Elizabeth Martin and Tom Risley studying word gaps which found that by age 3, before even reaching school age, children's ``trends in the amount of talk, vocabulary growth, and style of interaction were well established and clearly suggest widening gaps to come.'' So having poor reading skills makes it harder to make a living, it affects self-esteem, and it makes life more difficult in so many small ways. Think about this: unable to read a manual when you buy something, unable to read a list of ingredients, unable to read a newspaper to understand what is going on, to be online.  Millions of our friends and neighbors are struggling with these consequences every day. According to the Department of Education, about 32 million adults in this country can't read. Think about that. That is a group nearly 3 times the size of the State of Ohio and maybe 25 to 30 times the size of the Presiding Officer's State--32 million. Too many of these adults, of course, started off life with the disadvantage of this word gap, and they never caught up.  That is why this Read Aloud Month is so critical. Parents and other caretakers need to know they can steer their child in a better direction--develop vocabulary skills and end the word gap just by reading aloud to them.  Developing these skills, according to experts, affects the biology of the brain. Tzipi Horowitz-Kraus of Cincinnati Children's Hospital--a great institution in my hometown and one of the top three children's hospitals in the country, based on U.News and World Anyway, he is an expert on this topic, and this is what he said: ``The more you read to your child, the more you help the neurons in the brain to grow and connect.'' So it is physiological.  Kim Noble, a brain scientist at Columbia University, has found that this word gap actually translates into a brain-sized gap in the areas dealing with language.  Dana Suskind of the University of Chicago has found that more than 80 percent of a child's brain development occurs by age 3--80 percent--and the effects of the word gap are detected in brain development in babies as young as 9 months old. These aren't children; these are babies. Doctor Suskind says that by reading aloud, every parent has the ability to grow their child's brain.  So certainly before a child can read, before a child can even speak, it is important to be speaking to that child. Think about that. Think about the impact you can have. So get out a book and do some reading to a child, a grandchild, someone who is in the neighborhood, one of your kids. Do it tonight.  Sometimes when I talk about this, people say: Well, Rob, parenting is pretty tough. Everybody is busy. Some people are working two shifts. Both parents are working. Where do you make time for this? Here is my answer to that: Fifteen minutes a day. That is the goal here. Fifteen minutes a day makes a huge difference to be able to close that gap.  Others say: We can't afford it. How do you afford to buy these books if you are going to read all the time? To me, that is pretty simple. Buy a library card. They are free, usually. If not, they are cheap. You don't need a lot of new books, but you do need a library card, and that is very helpful. They helped Jane and me to be able to have books to read to our kids.  Again, I am very proud Ohio has led on this issue. In 2008, this group Read Aloud was started in Cincinnati, It has now become a national movement. It has more than 10,000 grassroots partners--including daycare facilities, schools and libraries, and rotary clubs--in all 50  So what can you do to help? I would say that this issue is not going to be found here in this body. It is not about Washington, DC, doing anything except encouraging people to do what makes sense, which is to spend time with your kid, to ensure that if you have a kid in school, that you know that kid gets the right start in life, to ensure that everybody has the ability to have a successful life.[[Page S2036]]  Senator Harris and I introduced a resolution about this recently in the U.It is called the Read Aloud Month resolution. It encourages parents and caregivers to read to their kids for 15 minutes a day. We are asking our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democratic, to sign off on that resolution. That would help raise the visibility of this issue.  Again, I hope everybody listening today takes the opportunity to follow up, to read to a kid, to help ensure they can close that words gap in their lives and therefore have a better chance of getting better grades, getting a better job, and achieving whatever their dream is in life.

939,topic-id,2289,"Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague for his good comments regarding Neil  I rise today to strongly support Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme  First, there is no question that Judge Gorsuch is qualified for this job. He served as a law clerk for two Supreme Court Justices, Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony He has also had a distinguished career in the public sector and in the private sector. Finally, of course, he worked in the Office of the Attorney He worked in the Justice Department, and he had a great reputation there as well.  Of course, in 2006, not that long ago, he came to the floor of the Senate to be confirmed to the Tenth And guess what. He was unanimously confirmed by this body. In fact, at the time, Senator Hillary Clinton voted to confirm him. Senator Joe Biden voted to confirm him. Senator Barack Obama voted to confirm him, and, by the way, so did a number of Democrats who are currently serving in the Not a single Senator objected. Why? Because the guy is so well qualified.  Since then, in his 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court, his record has shown that he is fair, he is independent, and he is a consensus builder, which only ratified what the Senate had done. It showed that, in fact, he was the kind of person who represents us well in court.  By the way, he is also a guy who knows how to find common ground. Listen to these numbers: 97 percent of the cases he has decided were unanimous decisions with the other two judges on the panel. Typically, as you know, these are judges who have been appointed by Presidents who are Republican and Finally, he has been in dissent less than 2 percent of the time. So this is a guy who 97 percent of the time is unanimous, and 2 percent of the time he is in dissent. Out of the more than 180 opinions he has written as a judge--180 opinions--only one had ever been appealed to the U.Supreme Court from the circuit court, and, by the way, that one was affirmed.  So this is a guy who clearly knows how to build a consensus, bring people together, and that is needed right now. It is needed in this body. It is needed in our country as a whole, and it is certainly needed in the judiciary.  By the way, it doesn't surprise me that he is a consensus builder. If you think about it, he was a law clerk for Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony They are both known famously as being consensus builders and being able to bring together disparate decisions to try to find a decision at the Supreme Court level. So he has seen it up close and personal. He knows how to do it.  I would say, though, in terms of this debate we are having, it is not just about Neil Gorsuch and it is not just about another seat, as important as it is, on the U.Supreme It is also an opportunity, by voting for Neil Gorsuch, to ensure that we have reestablished the proper role of this body, of the legislative branch and of the judicial branch in our system of government.  Judge Gorsuch understands that his job as a judge is not to impose his views on people but rather to apply the law, as written--to apply the law as written. That is kind of a basic part of our  He put it well in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary He said: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.'' What does he mean by that? I think what he meant is that he doesn't believe in substituting his personal views for what he is supposed to do as a judge.  So you may not like the decision, but you are constrained by the Constitution, by the law, and that is what judges should do.  He went on to say that the job of a judge is ``not about politics. . . . If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk.''  I think he is right about that. It is not about what he wants. It is what the Constitution and the law say. Judges should not legislate from the bench. That is not their job.  Judge Gorsuch and I met recently, and he has met, I think, with about 80 of my 100 colleagues in the Senate, and he has talked to them about his views privately. I was very impressed with him. I was impressed with him as a person, his background, and his family. I was impressed with his approach.  I was talking about what he said that he is not going to substitute his own personal views. He basically said to me what he said in public. He is going to uphold the law, as written, even if his personal beliefs had led him to vote against the law if he had been in my position, as a legislator. I think that is what you want in a court.  But don't take my word for it. Judge Gorsuch also has earned the respect of lawyers and judges across the spectrum. Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, who was an adviser to former President Obama and to previous Democratic Presidents, has said that Judge Gorsuch is ``a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with distinction.'' That is Laurence  Neal Katyal, who was President Obama's Acting Solicitor General--so a guy who knows a thing or two about arguing before the Supreme Court, because that is what the Solicitor General does with a lot of his time--has said that Judge Gorsuch's record ``should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the president who appointed him. . . . He's a fair and decent man.'' Again, this is the Acting Solicitor General for President  Yes, this debate is about something bigger than that, even. It is about Neil It is about his character, his experience, and his judgments, but it is also about something I think even more important than this division of powers in our It is about the rule of law itself. What does it mean?  Why does that matter? It matters because laws are an expression of the will of the people. The Constitution itself starts out with this idea, of course: ``We the people . . . establish this Constitution''--not ``we the Congress'' or ``we the government.'' It is we the people who govern ourselves. The government is the servant of the people under our Constitution, not the other way around.  When judges try to change the law rather than apply the law, they make themselves into an unelected legislative body. That is not just arrogant, by the way. I think that is unfair. Not because it steals legitimate authority from us, the elected representatives in Congress, but because it steals that authority and silences the voices of the people who elected us. Ultimately, that is what this is all about.  In this Republic, Congress writes the laws, the President ensures that the laws are faithfully executed, and the courts apply the law and our Constitution to specific cases that come before them. That is how it should work. That is how our Founders intended it.  I think it is more important now than ever to have a Supreme Court that understands this role and resists the urge to act as a superlegislature.  In recent decades, the Court has been increasingly asked to decide a lot of important matters that affect us all. Think about it. Healthcare, or the Affordable Care Act is an example, and[[Page S2074]]immigration, energy and environmental policies, social policies, First Amendment rights to free speech, freedom of religion, Second Amendment rights, and a hundred other issues. The Court affects all of our lives in ways that are fundamental, and rulings by the Court, of course, cannot be appealed to a higher court. All you can do is change the law. On constitutional provisions, you can't even do that.  At the same time as the scope of judicial power has expanded and as the significance of the Supreme Court's rulings has increased, there are some judges who have essentially rewritten statutes that did not suit them. They have taken the law and said: We are going to rewrite this in a way that we think works better. That is not their job.  One example I would give you is that a couple of years ago, the Supreme Court ruled, for example, that the words ``established by a state''--this was in the Affordable Care Act--could also mean ``not established by a state.'' I mean, literally, the Court said that, and that ``legislature'' could also mean a popular referendum. So they took the very words of a statute and said: We don't like the way that is written. We are going to change these words, and we are going to adjudicate this matter based on our understanding of these words, which is based on our personal opinion.  I don't think these rulings made sense logically but, more importantly, they changed the law, as written by the people and the people's  So the stakes are high here. We have to get this right. There are people who make the argument that the Constitution is such a living document, whose meaning evolves as popular opinion evolves, that we should make judges into basically pollsters or superlegislators. I don't think that makes sense. But, more importantly, I don't think it is fair, and it is one reason why so many people have felt like their voices aren't being heard, I believe, when the courts do that.  Again, Neil Gorsuch gets it. As he said in his testimony recently, his philosophy ``is to strive to understand what the words on the page mean . . . [to] apply what the people's representatives, the lawmakers, have done.''  This should be what we all want in a Supreme Court justice--someone who will fairly and impartially apply the law and protect the rights we have guaranteed by our  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would make a plea today: I would say that in this regard, I would think Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of Justice that you would like, someone who is actually going to apply the laws that you write--that we write--and not impose his personal views.  The American Bar Association--not known as a conservative body--has unanimously declared Judge Gorsuch ``well qualified'' for this job. That is their highest rating--``well qualified.'' That is what they have given him. The ABA has noted that ``based on the writings, interviews, and analyses we scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong but respectful voice in protecting it,'' meaning the independence of the judicial branch. That is pretty strong from the American Bar  By the way, despite these accolades he has gotten and his respect for the lawmaking that so many of us do here in this body, some of my colleagues on the other side may decide to vote against Judge Gorsuch, and they certainly have a right to do that. Of course, they do. But let's at least give him a vote. Let's give him an up-or-down vote. He deserves that. If a nominee this qualified can't get an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, it is not clear to me who could.  Some have argued recently that the standard for a Supreme Court Justice should be 60 votes in the Senate--not an up-or-down vote, not 51 votes or a simple majority. The Washington Post has looked at that recently, and the Washington Post gave the notion that it should be 60 votes three Pinocchios--that means the guy whose nose gets longer when he is not telling the truth. Here is what the Washington Post said: ``There is no `traditional' 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim otherwise.''  That is the Washington  In fact, as you probably know, two sitting Justices on the Supreme Court right now were actually confirmed by this body with less than 60 votes. Justice Thomas, a very controversial nomination at the time, was confirmed 52 to 48--hardly a tradition of confirming with 60 votes. Justice Alito was confirmed 58 to 42 only 10 years ago. In fact, as we have heard on this floor, there has never been a successful filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice in the history of this body. That is hardly the standard. So I urge my colleagues to give him a vote, and I hope the result will be the confirmation of this smart, mainstream, decent man who is so well qualified for the Supreme Court and who has made it clear, again, that he is not going to impose his personal beliefs on the rest of us but will apply the law as written, and he is going to adhere to the U.That is the kind of judge who deserves the support of all of us.

I would say that seat suits Congressman Smucker just fine. It is good to see him up there tonight.  Congressman Garamendi, I am the Congressperson from Montgomery County, Frederick County, and Carroll County, Maryland, the 8th Congressional District, which includes the NIH, the National Institutes of Health; so I have the great fortune and honor and responsibility of representing thousands of people who work at NIH and who live in Rockville and in the neighborhood. So I see this as not just a national treasure and resource, but also a vibrant and vital part of my community that I represent.  I speak tonight not just as a politician, but I speak also as someone who has--I guess what we call around here--a preexisting condition because when I was in the Maryland State senate and as a professor of constitutional law at American University, I was given a diagnosis in the year 2010 of colon cancer.                              {time}  1845  I learned something very interesting going through the experience about the difference between misfortune and injustice. Because if you have a job that[[Page H2509]]you love and a family that you love and constituents that you love and it is a beautiful day and you are told that you have got stage III colon cancer, that is a misfortune. It can happen to anybody--liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, Independent, old, young, every race, every ethnicity. It can happen to anybody. It is a misfortune.  At the time, I was the floor leader in Maryland on marriage equality legislation, and it struck me that the misfortune can happen to anybody. But if you can't get health insurance because you love the wrong person or because you are unemployed or because you are too poor, that is not just a misfortune. That is an injustice because we, as a society, can do something about that.  So when we think about Alzheimer's disease or cystic fibrosis or lung cancer or diabetes 1 or 2, in a democratic society, our obligation is not to compound the misfortunes of life with governmental injustice; our job is to try to reduce misfortune because we are all citizens together.  So that is why I am so proud to represent NIH because, as has been said very eloquently by a number of speakers tonight, the NIH is in the forefront of defending our population against disease and serious illness.  So let's talk about Alzheimer's for a little bit.  More than 5 million Americans are living today with Alzheimer's disease. That is about the population of my State--everybody in Maryland, from Baltimore to Rockville, to Silver Spring, to Bethesda, to Chevy Chase, to Middletown and Frederick County, to Sykesville, all over Carroll County, from the eastern shore to western Maryland, millions of people. That is how many people across the land are suffering from Alzheimer's disease. And it is a number that is rapidly increasing. It could be as high as 16 million people by 2050 is what the experts at NIH are telling us.  Since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's have increased a startling 89 percent. You have shown us what the graphs are, Mr.One in three senior citizens today dies from Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. For victims of this disease, it is demoralizing, devastating, debilitating, and draining for the whole family.  In Maryland, Alzheimer's affects 100,000 people, and it costs us around $1 billion in Medicaid dollars every year.  In 2017, it is estimated that, across the country, we will spend $259 billion caring for people with Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia, with $175 billion being borne by Medicare and Medicaid, alone. This means nearly one out of every five Medicare dollars is spent on Alzheimer's.  So we have got to move quickly and effectively to address the crisis and to solve the puzzle of Alzheimer's disease; otherwise, these costs are going to continue to grow even more sharply, and Alzheimer's could overwhelm our healthcare system.  We need a cure, which is why the good people at the Alzheimer's Association are asking Congress to support a $414 million increase in the research budget at NIH for Alzheimer's in FY 2018. But President Trump has proposed a $5.8 billion cut to the NIH, which is a 19 percent reduction in the NIH budget.  Why?  Well, it is very hard to know. It is part of a proposal to slash $60 billion in science research, environmental protection, housing, the human needs budget, and to shift it into the Now, that is at a time, Mr.Garamendi, when a committee I serve on, Oversight and Government Reform, just had hearings where Democrats and Republicans, alike, were outraged to learn that $125 billion in waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns is happening right now in the  We could save $125 billion just by taking seriously the problems in contracting and fraud and abuse that is taking place with the beltway bandits. But instead of going after that corruption and waste, they want to take $60 billion out of the human needs budget and shift it over to the  Well, that is going to have a disastrous effect on our ability to make progress. That is the point I think you are making tonight, Congressman You are saying that, when we invest in basic research on the diseases, we make progress.  Look what we have done with It is amazing. Look what is happening with cystic fibrosis. We are making real progress because we are investing. We have got to not cut back on any of the research that is taking place. We have got to double down and invest, and we really need to do that with Alzheimer's.  So this move to slash the human needs budget, the medical research budget, and put it in the Pentagon is an assault on science, on medicine, and on the health care of our people. These are our people whose lives are at stake that we are talking about. These are our families that are suffering the savage repercussions of Alzheimer's disease. It is a terrible infliction on the land.  So I think that the idea of slashing $6 billion from research for serious diseases like Alzheimer's, like the doomed repeal-and-replace legislation that crashed and burned on Friday of last week, is totally counterproductive and destructive of the true needs and priorities of our people.  We spend more money on the military than the next five or six countries combined, and the Pentagon is swimming in a deep pool of waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns today.  Let's focus on helping our own people right now, the way mature democracies do, not enriching beltway bandits and plutocrats and insiders the way that authoritarian governments do. The question of Alzheimer's is an urgent question for our time, just like the research into all of the other killer diseases that are afflicting our people.

873,topic-id,3438,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her fantastic leadership for the people of Washington in the city of Washington and her zealous advocacy for all of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, let me try to recap some of the themes that we have brought up this evening and talk about what is really at stake here. But I want to start with some good news, because there was really some great news out of Russia on Sunday, where more than 75,000 people across the country braved the tyranny and despotism of their government to go out into the streets to express their commitment to democracy, human rights, and against corruption.  They were focused very specifically on some of the oligarchs who surround Vladimir One of them, Prime Minister Medvedev, it has just been learned, has amassed more than $1 billion, as a public servant, in mansions, in vineyards in Italy, in fancy cars, in jewelry--$1 billion. And the people of Russia are up in arms about the corruption, the kleptocracy, the stealing from the Russian people, which is increasingly impoverished by the imperial designs and the corrupt practices of Putin and his team.  So tens of thousands of people went into the streets to protest. These are brave people, because you are talking about an authoritarian government there, a dictator, a despot, someone who orders out for the assassination of his political enemies. Many of them were arrested. Hundreds of them were arrested in Moscow, and some of them are still in jail right now.  Mr.Speaker, we should be on the side of the protesters in That is who we are as We are a nation conceived in revolutionary insurgency against corruption, against monarchy, against dictators and autocrats and theocrats and kleptocrats who steal from the people. That is who we are.  We should be meeting with them. We should be meeting with the human rights activists. We should be meeting with the anticorruption marchers who are putting themselves on the front lines of history. We should be meeting with the dissenters and the critics of Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs and big business kleptocrats who surround him. But, instead, our government has aligned with Putin himself, with the insiders in That is totally antithetical to the design of America, when you think about it.  Mr.Speaker, we have the great good fortune to go to work every day surrounded by portraits of people who built this country, like George Washington, who is right over there. We have got portraits of Thomas We have got portraits of Frederick We have got portraits of Abraham Lincoln, who actually served in this body and, when he was here, spent a lot of his time railing about a war that was concocted with lies by President James Polk, the Mexican  But Lincoln knew how delicate and precious and precarious an enterprise democracy is. In the Gettysburg Address, he posed the question of how long government of the people, by the people, and for the people can last. Will it perish from the Earth? And he put the question to the people because, he said, it is up to us.  Democracy is a rarity in human history. Democracy is not the norm. That is why America is a miraculous experiment on If you don't do anything, you are going to end up with dictators and despots and kleptocrats who steal from their own people, like Vladimir  But America started a different way. The first three words of our Constitution are ``We, the people.'' We, the people; we flipped the whole design. Before that, the whole theory was that the king had the power, and the king got power directly from God; and everybody was a subject of the king, and everybody served the king.  Our Founders had the vision, in that outburst of enlightenment and enthusiasm, to say, no, we are going to try something different:  We are going to start a government based on we, the people, and we are going to separate church and state; and we are not going to dictate to people their religious worship, and we are not[[Page H2555]]going to dictate to people their political beliefs. There is going to be freedom of thought and freedom of speech.  We don't trust the collapse of all powers into one, which Madison said was the very definition of tyranny. We are going to separate powers. The legislature, Congress, will come first, Article It will represent the people. But then we are going to have someone else execute the laws of the people, faithfully execute the laws of the people. That will be the And when there are disputes, they will be adjudicated in a third branch of government, by the Supreme Court, to figure it out.  But we are going to separate the powers, because when one guy has got all the power, it endangers the freedoms and the liberties of everybody else. We even said, even though our President is limited by the separation of powers, we are going to make sure that the President and also the Members of Congress will have an undivided, zealous loyalty only to the American people.  Article I, section 9 says we cannot accept presents, emoluments, which are any kind of payments, offices, or titles from foreign princes, foreign kings, or foreign states, period. We can't accept them without the approval of It doesn't go.  There were all kinds of powers that were sending spies and saboteurs to Washington, when the country first began, to try to pay off elected officials, but our Founders had the vision to say: No, we are not going to accept that. We are not going to allow payments and bribes and fancy presents being given to our elected officials.  So one government, separated powers, based on public integrity, honesty, and devotion to the people. That is the model here.  Now, we should be on the side of democratic movements all over the Earth, like the people who assembled in Moscow on Sunday, who assembled in Siberia on There were marchers even there. It was like our Women's It took place all over the country. Those are our people. We should be on the side of the people who are trying to overthrow the despotism in  But look what is happening. Tyranny and authoritarianism are on the march all over the world. Russia is the headquarters of it, but you can find it everywhere you look:  Philippines, a madman dictator who thinks he has the power to send his agents out to go and shoot people on the street because they look like they are a drug dealer and brags about it, Duterte;  Hungary, another favorite of Vladimir Putin, Mr.Orban, who is cracking down on press freedom, on human rights in his country;  Iran, authoritarian, theocratic state; people being thrown in jail for blasphemy, for heresy, for apostasy, for religious offenses;  Saudi Arabia, fomenting racist, anti-Semitic propaganda and sending it out, oppressing people based on religion, not even allowing women to drive in their society.  Everywhere you turn, tyranny, despotism on the march.  And Mr.Putin has a plan. How do we know it? Do we know it from the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference? We know it from our intelligence agencies, from the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence  Seventeen of America's intelligence agencies came back with a report, and they said Vladimir Putin has a plan to continue to destabilize and undermine liberal democracy all over the world.  Brexit was part of it. The intervention in our election was part of it. They are going after France, where they want the rightwing, ultra nationalist, anti-immigrant campaign of Marine Le Pen to triumph in They are trying to do it in Germany, which is now the strongest outpost of liberal democracy left on Earth, as of yet, uncontaminated by the penetration of Russian intelligence and Putin's agents.  But what did they do to us? What is this all about?  Well, we had an election in 2016. The sovereign people of America had an election. Now, unfortunately, we are still using the electoral college, which is antiquated and obsolescent. There is a movement to change it afoot to the national popular vote. But be that as it may, that is our system. We haven't reformed it yet. It is our system. It is our elections here in But the electoral college makes it more vulnerable because you just have to intervene in a handful of States in order to sway the vote.  What did Putin do? Again, we know this. I am not making this up. We know this from our intelligence agencies. If you don't believe me, you go to your computer and you just look up the intelligence agency report on Russian interference and espionage and sabotage in our 2016 election.  And what did they do?  They spied on different Democratic institutions, like the Democratic National Committee, and they spied on particular people.  They engaged in not just cyber espionage, but cyber sabotage.  They orchestrated a series of leaks which dominated election coverage in the United States for several weeks.  They orchestrated a campaign of fake news and propaganda in order to undermine Hillary Clinton, who was reviled--and is reviled, presumably--by Vladimir Putin because she challenged him, and she challenged the human rights situation in Russia and the involvement of Russia with various dictators in other parts of the world. So they interfered in our election.  When I first got to Congress, that was still being disputed. When we tried to talk about this, it was being said, well, there is no evidence that Russia did this. Well, guess what? The evidence is replete. It is decisive. It is determinative.                              {time}  1800  Now we are not hearing from our friends on the other side: Well, Russia didn't do this.  Now they are saying something different: Well, Russia may have done that. It may have been this massive, orchestrated campaign to undermine and subvert our elections, but there is no proof that that was actual collusion by the Trump campaign.  About that, I want to say two things. Number one, it shouldn't make any difference. Let's say nobody in the Trump campaign knew anybody in Russia and never heard of Vladimir It would make no difference because we should still view this as a radical threat to the political sovereignty of the American people.  But the second answer is even more important. As all of my colleagues were pointing out before, every day we get more evidence not just of contacts and connections, but actual collaboration and cooperation between people in the Trump campaign, the Trump family, and the Trump universe with Vladimir Putin and his closest agents and assets throughout Russia and around the world.  Let's just recap a few of those: former national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign, or I guess he was fired by President Trump after he failed to disclose the scope of his contacts with Russians, including Ambassador He was paid more than $33,000 in 2015 by Russian-funded propaganda media, and the full extent of his relationship to the Russians is still being investigated.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from this whole matter because he met several times with Ambassador Kislyak, who has been described as Russia's top spy in America during the 2016 election. Then--I will speak charitably here--he misled his own colleagues in the Senate about it at his Senate confirmation hearing raising the issue and then denying that he had had any contact with the Russians at all.  Senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian Ambassador at Trump Tower a few months ago in December of 2016. We have got former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who has admitted that he met with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention and met with managers from Rosneft, the Russian-owned oil company. He himself owns shares of a Russian energy company called  Roger Stone, Trump's longtime buddy and political adviser, was working with WikiLeaks, which published documents during the election based on information divulged because of Russian interference and espionage that[[Page H2556]]tilted the scales again in favor of Trump in the campaign, and he hosted a series on the Russian propaganda network.  Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager for 6 months, was an adviser to Ukrainian oligarchs who got sweetheart business deals from Putin's associates. He was also a business partner of Russian oligarchs close to He resigned in August of last year after reports surfaced that suggested that he had received $12.7 million from Ukraine's pro-Russia former president Viktor He was on the payroll for $10 million, it has just come out, in order to promote the Russian perspective and Putin's propaganda in Washington, D.C., and throughout the United States in order to change the course of U.politics.  Now, I am sorry to put these out there as a bunch of clues. I wish we had a coherent story to tell. We don't, because what we need is a comprehensive 9/11-style independent investigation to figure out what precisely happened. In America you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Nobody is putting any of these people in jail, but it has come out, despite their best efforts in some cases, that they are up to their necks in the Russian connection.  What does that mean for American democracy?  What we know is there was a massive independent expenditure in 2006. That is what we call it under our FEC law when you go out and spend money to try to destroy one candidate and help another. There was a massive foreign independent expenditure orchestrated by Vladimir  The question is: Was it, in FEC terms, a coordinated expenditure? That is, did the Trump team actively work with them?  As we are saying, there are lots of clues that suggest it is so. I am not willing to say that they were definitely in cahoots with them. I am not willing to say that they were necessarily collaborating the election. But the evidence accumulates every single day that points in that direction.  Now every day in Washington, D.C., what we are doing is running around because there is a coverup that has been unfolding. Today, of course, we are dealing with a resolution in the House Judiciary Committee to try to get to the bottom of what Chairman Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee actually did when he ran over to the White House with some information that he had about Trump apparently being picked up incidentally in conversations that were being tapped by the American intelligence community with foreign operatives. Again, it is shadowy because we don't know the whole thing. But what we do know is that Chairman Nunes went to the White House to tell President Trump or his deputies before he told anybody here in  Now, we have been saying from the beginning we want an independent, objective 9/11-style commission--no Democratic politicians, no Republican politicians, and no elected officials. Let's agree on gifted statesmen and stateswomen who can really get to the bottom of this if we care about the truth. Their answer has been: No, we have got the Intelligence Committee to do it instead.  But now what we have got is the Intelligence Committee chair traveling back and forth to the White House, spilling the beans, which undermines everybody's confidence in the integrity of the investigation that is taking place into the Russian connection and what actually happened in the 2016 election.  Mr.Speaker, in the American system of government, elected officials have to have undivided loyalty to the American people. That is why we have got the Emoluments Clause: no presents, no emoluments, no offices, and no titles from foreign governments. That is why we swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States of Each one of us who has the great honor and privilege of coming to Washington, D.C., to represent the people swear an oath to our Constitution and to our people.  We are not a country, like so many, that are defined by one religion. We are not defined by one race. We are not defined by one ethnicity. We are not defined by one political party. We are not defined by one political ideology. We are defined by one That is what unifies us as We must be constitutional patriots here and insist upon our constitutional values and the rule of law for democracy to be meaningful in the 21st century.  There is a new model of tyrannical government traveling all over the world, and all the bullies and despots have found each other. They are in league together. They want government as a moneymaking operation. They want government as a moneymaking operation for private elites in their country, whether it is in Russia or the Philippines or Saudi Sad to say, we are starting to see the development of that right here in the United States of  So we have the opportunity and we have the responsibility to exercise our rights as citizens under the First Amendment and to exercise our privileges as Members of Congress under the speech or debate clause to speak up against the march of tyranny all over the We have got an obligation to resist the corruption--the same corruption that the people in Russia were marching against on We must demand real answers about what took place in our Presidential election in 2016. The intelligence agencies warned us that what happened in 2016 was a dress rehearsal for what is going to happen the next time and the time after that.  I want to say something about the geopolitics of this. Think about it for a second:  Who has got the strongest economy on Earth?  We do, the freest, the original democracy. We have got the strongest economy.  Who has got the strongest military?  We do.  Russia can't come close. But the way I understand what happened in 2016 was that Vladimir Putin--who is not an honest man, but he is a clever man--decided that this was a moment of opportunity for He is the former chief of the Let's not forget that. He is the guy who said that the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet He is an irredentist imperialist who wants to go back and reconstruct the Russian empire.  But what he saw was an opportunity, which is that today the whole world is linked, and it is linked by the internet. He created something that I think of as a Manhattan Project for military conquest and defeat of the liberal democracies in the 21st century.  He set about to figure out this question: How can we undermine and subvert the liberal democracies?  These are open societies. America is an open society. We pride ourselves on the First Amendment, on freedom of speech, and on free dialogue and discussion.  So he said to himself: How can I subvert and undermine that?  The answer became very clear: to create--really on the cheap, because compared to military might, this is pennies on the dollar--he was going to create an internet army, in effect, to try to undermine and subvert our democracy with fake news, with propaganda, and with paid trolls to get information out to try to destroy the reputations of opposition politicians and to try to promote the parties that he viewed as ``within his camp.''  Guess what?  It still is going on today. It is still happening. We are not talking about ancient history. We are talking about an ongoing project. That is why I am proud to be a member of the minority caucus here, the Democratic Party caucus, which is insisting that we create an independent, objective, neutral, 9/11-style commission to investigate the Russian connection and what happened with the attack on American democracy in 2016.  We have got to get to the bottom of it. Two-thirds of the American people in public opinion polls say that they support such a commission. There is nobody who would oppose it except for somebody who has got something to hide. But for the rest of us, we have every reason to get to the bottom of this plot to destroy our election in 2016, and we have every reason to defend this great constitutional democracy with everything we have got.

735,topic-id,956,"Mr.President, along with Senator Collins, I am introducing legislation that would eliminate the sunset date for U.Interagency Council on Homelessness--the Council--so that this independent agency can build upon its success in helping to prevent and end homelessness nationally.  The Council was established under the Reagan administration as part of the landmark McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. Since that time, it has worked across the Federal Government and private sector to coordinate homeless assistance nationally. In 2009, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing, or HEARTH Act, which I authored and introduced along with Senator Collins and others, expanded the Council's role to work with public, nonprofit, and private stakeholders to develop a national strategic plan to end homelessness. On June 22, 2010, the Council unveiled this plan, called Opening Doors, which has guided its work to develop and expand on effective strategies across the country to prevent and end homelessness.  Since Opening Doors was unveiled, the U.Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, reports that overall homelessness has decreased by 14 percent, chronic homelessness by 27 percent, and family homelessness by 23 percent. In addition, we have seen veterans' homelessness drop by 47 percent. This progress is not only a result of the more than $500 million Federal investment in housing and supportive services through programs like HUD-VASH but is also because of the direction the Council provides to the Departments of Veterans Affairs and HUD, as well as public housing agencies administering assistance at the local level. Specifically, the Council helped various partners align their resources, efforts, goals, and measures of success for serving homeless veterans. Under this approach, the Commonwealth of Virginia, Connecticut, Delaware, the city of New Orleans, and DeKalb County in Georgia, to name a few, have all declared an end to veterans' homelessness.  Yet more work remains. And here, too, the Council is an important part of developing solutions. For instance, nearly 36,000 unaccompanied youth under the age of 25 experienced homelessness in 2016. While some communities have started to develop responses to youth homelessness, it is a complex problem that requires a tailored approach taking into account the local variables of foster care, primary to postsecondary education, housing, and healthcare systems. Finding new ways to deliver and fund assistance to this diverse population is essential, and that is why Senator Collins and I held a hearing in our subcommittee on this matter and worked together to include over $40 million in targeted resources to address youth homelessness in both the fiscal year 2016 and 2017 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, THUD, appropriations bills. As part of this new funding, the Council will be executing a broader collaborative effort with foster care networks, the juvenile justice community, and education partners to create and find[[Page S2050]]success in coordinated, cost-effective solutions that meet community needs. The Council's expertise in implementing complex Federal programs at the local level will continue to be critical to the success of this initiative.  For all of this good work the Council has done and continues to do, it is vital that we keep its doors open. The Council, as the only agency at the federal level charged specifically with addressing homelessness, has helped communities not only reduce homelessness, but it has also helped to save money. We know that people experiencing homelessness are more likely to access expensive health care services and spend more time in incarceration--which are extremely costly to taxpayers, states, and local governments. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, ``Based on 22 different studies from across the country, providing permanent supportive housing to chronically homeless people creates net savings of $4,800 per person per year, through reduced spending on jails, hospitals, shelters, and other emergency services.''  The Council has helped to build upon these estimated savings by identifying and tailoring cost-effective solutions that reduce the level of health care services, as well as recidivism, for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. In fiscal year 2016 alone, the Council's modest $3.5 million budget catalyzed more than $5 billion in combined Federal resources that aim to address homelessness. It develops national strategies that inform the work and improve the cost-effectiveness of programs administered by 19 Federal agencies, and as a result, communities and Sates are able to leverage housing, health, education, and labor funding more strategically and effectively.  In our current budgetary environment we need a wise and creative arm to help our communities identify and maximize resources and opportunities where possible, to ensure we are actually addressing homelessness, and not contributing to it. The Council is proof that the government can work and save money in the process, and our bipartisan legislation ensures that the Council's doors remain open until there truly is an end to homelessness nationwide.  I thank the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, HousingWorksRI, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, A Way Home America, Community Solutions, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, Funders Together to End Homelessness, the True Colors Fund, the National Housing Trust, the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, LISC, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, National Network for Youth, LeadingAge, Heartland Alliance, National Housing Conference, the National AIDS Housing Coalition, Covenant House International, the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, the Forum for Youth Investment, the Housing Assistance Council, Volunteers of America, the Coalition on Human Needs, the Corporation for Supportive Housing, the Technical Assistance Collaborative, and the National Coalition for the Homeless for their support.

1266,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, the Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act, which I reintroduce today with Senator Grassley, Senator Heitkamp, and Senator Leahy, will enhance the ability of securities regulators to protect investors and demand greater accountability from market players. Even after the financial crisis that crippled the economy, we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will persist.  Today, the amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC can fine an institution or individual is limited by statute. During hearings I held in 2011 in the Securities, Insurance, and Investment Banking Subcommittee, I learned how this limitation significantly interferes with the SEC's ability to perform its enforcement duties. At that time, the agency had been criticized by a Federal judge for not obtaining a larger settlement against Citigroup, a major player in the financial crisis that settled with the SEC in an amount that was a fraction of the cost the bank had inflicted on investors. The SEC explained that the reason for the low settlement amount was a statutory prohibition against levying a larger penalty. Indeed, then SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro in 2011 also explained that ``the Commission's statutory authority to obtain civil monetary penalties with appropriate deterrent effect is limited in many circumstances.''  The bipartisan bill Senator Grassley and I are reintroducing finally updates the SEC's civil penalties statute. This bill strives to make potential and current offenders think twice before engaging in misconduct by increasing the maximum civil monetary penalties permitted by statute, directly linking the size of the maximum penalties to the amount of losses suffered by victims of a violation and substantially raising the financial stakes for repeat offenders of our Nation's securities laws.  Specifically, our bill would give the SEC more options to tailor penalties to the specific circumstances of a given violation. In addition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``tier[[Page S2154]]three,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10 million per offense for entities, the legislation would also give the SEC additional options to obtain greater penalties based on the ill-gotten gains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.  Our bill also addresses the disturbing trend of repeat offenders on Wall Street through two provisions. The first would allow the SEC to triple the penalty cap applicable to recidivists who have been held either criminally or civilly liable for securities fraud within the previous 5 years. The second would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty against those that violate existing Federal court or SEC orders, an approach that would be more efficient, effective, and flexible than the current civil contempt remedy. Both of these changes would substantially improve the ability of the SEC's enforcement program to ratchet up penalties for recidivists.  Slightly more than half of all U.households are invested in the stock market. They deserve a strong cop on the beat that has the tools it needs to go after fraudsters and pursue the difficult cases arising from our increasingly complex financial markets. The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act will give the SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street, which in turn will increase transparency and confidence in our financial system. I urge our colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation to enhance the SEC's ability to protect investors and to deter and crack down on fraud.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2153-2.txt,1982,AMERICA CAN DO BETTER,2017.0,30.0,March

389,topic-id,1124,"Mr.President, I am pleased that in the Senate we are about to take a vote on ratifying the protocol of the accession of Montenegro to  What I wanted to do was to take a few moments to explain to people why I think this is an important vote and an important moment for our security as a nation but also to protect our interests abroad and that of our allies.  We all know that NATO--the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--was started right after World War It was primarily designed in the Cold War to confront the threats posed by the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Of course those threats have changed since the end of that Cold  Here is what hasn't changed. What hasn't changed is the need for America and her allies in a strong way to remain engaged in the world. That need has not changed. What has not changed is the need for democracies to be able to come together and collectively defend not just their interests but the interests of all people around the world where freedom is threatened. The difficult, painful lesson of history is that dictators and tyrants are never pleased with what they have. They always want more. They always need more. That is why it is so important that those nations on Earth--luckily and in a blessed way, more people than ever before find themselves living in societies where the people get to choose their leaders.  These alliances we have around the world--NATO being chief among them--help advance our strategic and economic interests, but most importantly, they help to keep our country safe.  There is a lot of talk about how much countries are paying into NATO, and it is true that the United States is by far the largest contributor to I think that is a combination of two things: one, decisions that were made by some of our allies in Europe on how they want to spend their government's money, and the other is just the reality that we are the United States of America, and as the United States of America, we will always find that we are always making a disproportionate share and contribution on everything, from global aid to fight off hunger and disease, to collective security.  While we can urge our allies, encourage our allies, and ask our allies to make a greater contribution to their own defense, we should not fall into the trap of diminishing what they are doing and what they have done.  First of all, in Europe today, many of our NATO allies are increasing their defense spending. They are doing so in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its increased aggression elsewhere in the region. Their soldiers are joining ours in deploying to Central and Eastern Europe to reassure our allies who are facing aggression and potential aggression from Vladimir  With all this talk about NATO and money and how much everyone is giving, I think it is important to take a moment to also understand that our NATO allies have fought beside us and have died beside Americans in Afghanistan, where more than 1,100 soldiers of the NATO-led coalition paid the ultimate price with their lives. It is important to note this because on September 11, 2001, Paris was not attacked, Berlin was not attacked, and London was not attacked on that horrible day; yet these nations and others, our partners, invoked a shared commitment that led them to stand beside us on the other side of the world in an effort to prevent another attack like September 11 from taking place again on American soil or anywhere in the world.  Montenegro is not even a member of NATO yet. Yet it sent hundreds of servicemembers to join the American-led coalition in  I have always argued that when our alliances, such as NATO, are under pressure from our potential adversaries and foes, we need to continue to expand and allow countries that meet the standards set by the alliance to join. That has never been more important than it is now, given the uncertainty and security challenges we face in Europe, especially as Vladimir Putin continues his aggression and continues to threaten stability in the region.  To be frank, Putin would love nothing more than to destroy In fact, you can see him trying to do that on a regular basis. He has tried to divide these countries, turn them against each other. He supports candidates throughout Europe who would take their countries out of NATO, constantly calling into question its viability. Vladimir Putin wants countries like Montenegro to remain in his sphere of influence and what I would call his sphere of threat, as his recent attempts to deploy his asymmetrical tools to influence Montenegrin politics have shown. That is why it is so important that we are moving to ratify Montenegro's access to NATO and to strengthen our relationship with Montenegro through  As the Senate and as a country, we are sending a clear message to Vladimir Putin that we will not accept the establishment of a Russian sphere of influence over countries that desire to[[Page S1987]]ally themselves with the free and democratic community of nations.  Today, I have tried to refrain from using the term ``Russian'' sphere of influence or ``Russia'' because the fact is, as I said to someone earlier today or yesterday, there is a difference between Russia and Vladimir Putin, and the events of the last 48 hours remind us of that. We are watching as many Russians who also desire to join the community of nations have turned out in cities and in places across Moscow and in other places in the thousands. They have turned out to protest the rampant corruption that fuels the Putin regime. And the Putin regime, as all totalitarian regimes do, has cracked down. They have arrested and detained hundreds of peaceful protesters. I ask you to compare that to Montenegro, whose membership in NATO will help the United States and Montenegro deepen our already strong bilateral relationship.  The stakes here are extraordinarily high for the United States and for our European allies. The Senate needs to send a strong message of solidarity with those in Europe who are standing up to the anti-democratic tactics of Vladimir Putin and his cronies.

213,topic-id,394,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Republican's so-called healthcare bill.  It pains me to even call it a healthcare bill because it is actually a massive tax cut for insurance CEOs that provides nearly zero healthcare benefits for the American people.  In fact, TrumpCare ensures that 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance coverage. Seniors will be charged more, and insurance companies will once again dictate the health of the American people. On the very day that the majority tax cuts for the rich come into effect, on January 1, 2018, at least 40,000 of my own constituents would immediately lose their health care.  But that is not all. The Republican idea of health coverage will leave millions of Americans without the basic health services that they expect and that they deserve. That means that the monthly premium you pay won't cover all of the services you will need to get better if you get sick. The Republican healthcare plan won't cover your emergency room visit, the X-rays, or even the prescription drugs you need to recover.  Heaven forbid if you need prenatal or pediatric care, too. Basically, under this plan, one illness is enough to bankrupt a family for a lifetime. If you asked anyone on the street, no one in America would call this health insurance. Yet, my Republican colleagues hail this as choice--the choice to go bankrupt if you get sick or, God forbid, have an accident.  So, Mr.Speaker, I have to ask: How many Republicans are left who actually support the bill?

692,topic-id,978,"Mr.President, I rise to comment briefly on Russian interference in the electoral processes in this country and across the West and governments of many of Russia's own neighbors.  We are in the middle of a civilization warfare crisis of public trust in this country. This isn't about the last 2 months. This isn't just about the last Presidential election. This is fundamentally about the last few decades of declining public trust in a broad range of our institutions: the press, political parties, executive branch agencies, the Congress, and beyond.  Russia is not unaware of our own distrust of each other. Russia is not unaware of our own increasing self-doubt about our shared values. Russia is today very self-consciously working to further erode confidence in our self-government by pulling at the threads of our public and civic life. Moscow's influence campaigns don't start by creating wholly new problems out of thin air, but rather by exploiting fissures that already exist in our civilization. The simplest way for Russia to try to weaken us is by trying to exploit the places where we are already weak, the places where we are already distrustful, and the places where we are failing to pass along a shared understanding of American values to the next generation.  The sad state of modern politics and the explosion of digital media are proving to be ripe targets for many of our own internal doubts and our own discord. We--all of us, Republicans and Democrats, the legislature and the executive branch--are ill-prepared for the challenges that are already on our doorstep, let alone what comes next with the acceleration of these kinds of technologies.  Today in the Wall Street Journal, we in this body were rebuked--rightly rebuked, I think, and rebuked in a bipartisan way by former Congressman Mike Chairman Rogers, a Republican, served as the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee from 2011 through 2015. I am going to read his op-ed rebuke into the Record today, but I would humbly ask that all 100 Members of this body calmly and self-critically consider carefully Chairman Rogers' argument, for his argument is not fundamentally against Republicans alone. It is not against Democrats alone. He is offering double-barreled criticism of all of us in the Congress--criticism of both parties. Why of both parties? Because Russia's influence campaign is a really big deal. Are we Republicans listening? Also, because our response to Russia's influence campaign is not primarily about who you supported last November in the Presidential election.  Listening to the Democrats, it is sometimes hard to understand if that side of the aisle remembers that basic fact about what Russia's influence campaign was up to. Russia's goals in our most recent election were not initially about one candidate versus another candidate. We need to underscore this. There are particulars that those of us who spend time reading classified intelligence know we can't discuss in this unclassified setting. But the big, broad point is simple and needs to be shouted, and that is that Putin's fundamental goals are about undermining Putin's fundamental goals are about making us doubt our own values: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right of protest or redress of grievances.  The Kremlin isn't attempting an influence campaign to make Americans believe that the sky is green or the grass is blue. He is trying to undertake an influence campaign to make us doubt our own First Amendment values. The Kremlin wants us to believe that our society is as corrupt as the thugocracy that Putin and his cronies are trying to advance. That isn't true, but if you listen to us in this body, we regularly do very little to restore the kind of public trust that Putin is actively working to undermine.  So I ask that each Member of this body would humbly and carefully consider Chairman Rogers' rebuke to the Congress this morning. This is from the Wall Street Journal, Chairman Rogers; headline: ``America is Ill-Prepared to Counter Russia's Information Warfare.''       When historians look back at the 2016 election, they will      likely determine that it represented one of the most      successful information operation campaigns ever conducted. A      foreign power, through the targeted application of cyber      tools to influence America's electoral process, was able to      cast doubt on the election's legitimacy, engender doubts      about the victor's fitness for office, tarnish the outcome of      the vote, and frustrate the new President's agenda.       Historians will also see a feckless Congress--both      Democrats and Republicans--that focused on playing partisan      ``gotcha'' and fundamentally failed in its duty to gather      information, hold officials accountable, and ultimately serve      our country's interests.       Whether or not the Trump campaign or its staff were      complicit in Moscow's meddling is missing the broader point:      Russia's intervention has affected how Americans now view the      peaceful transition of power from one president to the next.      About this we should not be surprised. Far from it.       Propaganda is perhaps the second- or third-oldest      profession. Using information as a tool to affect outcomes is      as old as politics. Propaganda was familiar to the ancient      Greeks and Romans, the Byzantines, and the Han Each      generation applies the technology of the day in trying to      influence an adversary's people.       What's new today is the reach of social media, the      anonymity of the internet, and the speed in which falsehoods      and fabrications can propagate. Twitter averaged 319 million      monthly users in the fourth quarter of 2016. Instagram had      600 million accounts at the end of last year. Facebook's      monthly active users total 1.86 billion--a quarter of the      global population. Yet each of these staggering figures      doesn't fully capture the internet's reach.       In February, Russia's minister of defense, Sergey Shoigu,      announced a realignment in its cyber and digital assets. ``We      have information troops who are much more effective and      stronger than the former `counter-propaganda' section,'' ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2032-2.txt,2289,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,28.0,March

Rather than regulating based on the sensitivity of our data, these rules are applied unevenly, based on what type of company you are or what kind of technology you use.

In fact, Republicans proposed making it harder for the FTC to pursue privacy and data security cases.  The protections that the FCC adopted last year were very simple: consumers should know what data is being collected, opt in to sharing of sensitive data, have their data reasonably protected, and receive notice when their data is compromised.

And as the threat of climate change becomes increasingly clear, Republicans are trying to reverse the progress that we have made to address this global challenge.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have voted to block environmental protections.

385,topic-id,1358,"Mr.President, last week TrumpCare died, and lots of people are trying to figure out exactly what happened. In my view, it was not a lack of strategy; it was not a lack of effort; it was not a lack of personal relationship between the Speaker and the It died because the policy stank. It died because people actually--left, right, and center--decided that cutting Medicaid by $900 billion in order to provide a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans of the exact same amount was just not a good idea in policy or in politics.  Now that TrumpCare has crashed and burned, Republicans are essentially going to try to do the same thing--tax cuts for the rich. Yet, this time, instead of funding it by cutting Medicaid, they are going to charge people more for groceries. Here is their proposal: They want to cut taxes for corporations again. That is what they want to do. Whether one is talking about infrastructure or whether one is talking about healthcare or whether one is talking about so-called tax reform, their solution to everything is to cut taxes for corporations. They want to cut taxes for corporations again, but this time American families will pay for it through taxes on groceries and the other stuff they have to buy on a day-to-day basis.  We have seen this before. It is a giveaway for corporations and the wealthiest among us, but, as usual, they have to find a pay-for, a way to make the arithmetic work, a way to pay for it. They are going to keep proposing so-called solutions for healthcare, infrastructure, or in this case tax reform, but they are basically the same proposal. It is a subsidy for Wall It is because they cannot help themselves.  This particular giveaway will cost the average American family thousands of dollars. Families will have to pay more for gas, medicine, clothes, cars, food. That is how a so-called border adjustment tax works. Everything one buys in the United States will be taxed, and everything outside of the United States will not be taxed. The sort of principle behind that is that somehow we are going to stimulate exports and disincentivize imports. It is not just that you are paying more on the stuff that is imported; it is that everything in the United States that you purchase you will have to pay more for in order to incentivize exports. But all you are doing is charging the American people more. This is essentially a sales tax.  I talked to members of my staff, and they were trying to get into the sort of technocratic, legal details about whether it is technically a sales tax or a value-added tax or a border adjustment tax that fits into some other legal category. But for a regular person, it does not matter what you call it; if you pay more and the government is collecting it, it is an increase in taxes.  They are going to dazzle you with complexity, and I think some in the House Republican leadership are very skillful at trying to make this more complicated than it is. They are trying to dazzle you with complexity so you do not know what they are doing. They are raising taxes on groceries and all of the stuff you buy. That is their version of tax reform.  I can understand. The Tax Code is awful, it is a mess, and we have been trying to do tax reform for I think 30 years. It is not unreasonable for the average American to say ``Yes, you ought to reform the Tax Code,'' but, remember, when they talk tax reform, they want you to have to go to the store and buy a steak, a hotdog, a head of lettuce, gasoline, pillows, diapers, paper--whatever you need--and it is going to cost more with so-called tax reform. If they succeed, the average American family could pay up to $1,700 more per year in order that corporations can get their tax cuts. Think about what $1,700 means for families across the country. For a family of four, with two kids in middle school, $1,700 pays for a few months' worth of groceries. In Hawaii, $1,700 will cover rent for a month, and in lots of other places, it will cover rent for 4 or 5 months. For some people, it pays a year's worth of an electric bill. In the State of Hawaii, it will pay for 4 or 5 months of your electric bill.  We know for certain this will hurt consumers, but on a macroeconomic level--in other words, for the entire country--we have no idea what a border adjustment tax would actually do in terms of our international relationships.  I understand. I voted against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the trade promotion authority. I have been very, very concerned about the extent to which we have not been getting the better of these trade deals, especially when it comes to people who are in unions across the country. But we do not want to engage in a trade war. We do not want to screw up American manufacturing, American farming. We have no idea what the impact would be. Even if one is willing to accept increasing the cost of goods in the United States for some theoretical possibility that this will incentivize exports, we have no idea what it is going to do to the American economy overall. Even in the best-case scenario, entire industries will fall apart.  Take tourism. In 2016 alone, tourism supported nearly 5.5 million American jobs directly and almost 10 million more in industries like restaurants and retail. The tourism industry pumps $2.6 billion into our economy every day. That is more than $30,000 per second.  I will say one other thing about tourism. As we worry about automation, as we worry about artificial intelligence, as we worry about a global economy that is going to eviscerate some of our core industries, tourism is one thing that cannot be taken away from us. If people want to go to Los Angeles, if people want to go to Cleveland, if people want to go to Hawaii, if people want to go to Louis, MO, or Kansas City, MO, or Florida, these are jobs that cannot be taken away. So if you want to infuse cash into an economy, create a tourism economy--all of these jobs and all of this revenue will be under threat if this works out the way they want it to work out because the dollar will be so strong that Americans will want to travel abroad and foreigners will want to travel far, far away from us.  Why are we punishing consumers and small businesses? Why are we putting entire industries at risk? House Republicans will tell you it is because they think the corporate tax is too high, but here is the truth: Right now, major corporations have huge teams of tax lawyers who set up fake shell companies so that they get around paying Federal taxes at all, or they abuse loopholes to drastically lower what they owe to the U.That is why we see some corporations that end up paying zero dollars in Federal income tax year after year even though they are making a healthy profit in the United  Together, Republicans and Democrats should be going after these tax dodgers. Instead of just getting rid of loopholes, they have decided to tax consumers. This makes no sense, and that is why we have to stop it.  Last week, we saved healthcare for 24 million Americans because people[[Page S1985]]across the country of all political persuasions stood up to fight. This week, the fight goes on. Once again, far too many people are in the crosshairs. I believe strongly that so long as we continue to stand together, we can win this one too.

That is why the Veterans Choice[[Page S2140]]Program was started--so that thousands of veterans and their families can get the care they deserve when and where they need it. Instead of traveling long distances or waiting months on a list, veterans can use the Choice Program to get the healthcare they need in their own communities.  As the ranking member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to give a little perspective on what would happen to our veterans if we don't pass the bipartisan Veterans Choice Program Improvement  Now, I know that the Choice Program is not funded through my subcommittee, but what we do today has an impact on the VA as a whole. If the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act does not pass, the funding we appropriated to the VA will expire before it has all been used. It is not a small amount of funding. It is $1 billion, and the VA does not have $1 billion elsewhere in the budget to make up for this loss.  In other words, if we don't pass this bill, it is going to be a disaster for veterans because all of the veterans who use this program for their healthcare are going to have to go back to the That means the wait times that everybody was complaining about over the last couple of years will grow longer and longer and longer, and especially in rural America, where access to care is such a challenge, it will get worse and worse.  To manage the increase in patient load, the VA will have to scramble to find funding that can take away from other VA programs, including hospital maintenance and medical equipment. That is what is going to happen if we don't pass this bill. This is an urgent matter for veterans across the country. Whether you are a participant in the VA Choice Program or you go to a traditional VA clinic or hospital, one way or another, this is going to impact you.  Now, I know the Choice Program isn't perfect, but this temporary extension, coupled with the improvements in the system contained in the bill, gives Congress the time we need to develop a long-term, comprehensive solution. And while we are working on a solution, let's not punish veterans by cutting off $1 billion toward a program that is designed to improve services for people who have served our country.

383,topic-id,1402,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on a few topics. First, on the investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia, this is a matter of such gravity, we need to get it right. There should be no doubt about the integrity and impartiality of the investigation, either in the executive branch, where the FBI and Department of Justice are looking into it, or in Congress, where the Intelligence Committees of both Chambers are conducting an investigation.  Unfortunately, the House Intelligence Committee has come under a cloud of suspicion and partisanship. A few months ago, Chairman Nunes spoke to reporters at the request of the White House to tamp down stories on the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, which is exactly what his committee now must investigate. This past week, Chairman Nunes broke with the committee process and tradition to brief the President on information he had learned but hadn't yet shared with the committee. We have learned this morning that Chairman Nunes was at the White House the day before that event--doing what? We don't know. It could very well be the case that Chairman Nunes was briefing members of the administration about an investigation of which they are the subject.  Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the President than in seeking the truth. You cannot have the person in charge of an impartial investigation be partial to one side. It is an inherent contradiction, and it undermines decades of bipartisan cooperation on the Intelligence Committee, which handles such sensitive information paramount to national security. It undermines Congress as a coequal branch of government meant to hold the executive branch accountable for its actions, and it corrodes the American people's confidence in our government.  If Speaker Ryan wants the House to have a credible investigation, he needs to replace Chairman Congress was meant by the Framers to be separate and equal, and I sincerely worry that under his direction, Mr.Nunes is pushing the committee into a direction of obsequiousness and not one that is asking the hard questions and getting the important answers.  There has always been a grand tradition of bipartisanship on the Intelligence When Members go into the SCIF, the room where they get secure briefings, they check their partisanship at the door. Chairman Nunes is right on the edge of doing permanent damage to that grand tradition of bipartisanship. Chairman Nunes seems to be more of a partisan for the President than an impartial actor. He has not been cooperating like someone who is interested in getting to the unvarnished truth. His actions look like those of someone who is interested in protecting the President and his party, and that doesn't work when the goal of the committee is to investigate Russia and its connection to the President and his campaign.  Without further ado, Speaker Ryan should replace Chairman                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, on another matter, the failure of TrumpCare this past Friday was a good day for the American people. We can finally put to bed the disaster of a bill that was TrumpCare, which would have resulted in spottier coverage, 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage, and higher costs, premiums, and deductibles for the middle class, the working poor, and older Americans, all to finance close to $600 billion in tax breaks for wealthy Americans should breathe a sigh of relief that TrumpCare will not become law. We are happy that it is gone. We can finally move on.  As I have said many times, we Democrats, provided our Republican colleagues drop ``replace'' and stop undermining the ACA, are willing to work with our Republican friends to improve the existing law. No one ever said the Affordable Care Act was perfect. We have ideas to improve it; hopefully, our colleagues on the Republican side do as well. I hope once ``replace'' is dropped and the ACA is no longer undermined by the administration, we can sit down and talk about it.  Unfortunately, the administration has already done several things that undermine the law and hurt the people. During the final weeks of open enrollment, the Trump administration discontinued the public advertising campaigns that encouraged people to sign up for insurance. The administration is working behind the scenes to give insurers flexibility to offer Americans less coverage for the healthcare they need, and the Executive order that President Trump issued directing agencies to facilitate the repeal and replacement of the ACA has destabilized the marketplace. Now that TrumpCare is off the table, the President should rescind the Executive order.  Today, I am urging the President and his entire administration to immediately cease all efforts to undermine the People's lives are at stake.  The President should not hope that the healthcare system for tens of millions explodes. He should not want premiums to go up on his watch. He should not hope that Americans lose treatment for opioid addiction on his watch. This approach is wrong, and wrong in two ways: First and foremost, it is wrong because it hurts people. The President must be a leader. It is not leadership for the President to hurt people and actively work to undermine our Nation's healthcare system simply because he is angry that he didn't get his way on repealing the That is not Presidential, that is petulance.  Secondly, this approach will not work politically. Donald Trump is no longer an outsider; he is The American people are looking to him to help solve their problems. If he doesn't, it is going to hurt him and his party. Pointing the finger of blame isn't going to solve anyone's problems. That strategy is not only bad for the American people and beneath the Presidency, it will backfire politically. He is in charge. People want him to make their lives better, not make them worse because of some political anger or vendetta.  I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do care deeply about fixing the Nation's healthcare problems, and we are ready to do that with them in a bipartisan way. But, of course, repeal must be taken off the table, and the President must stop hurting citizens by undermining the Affordable Care                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, finally, on tax issues, now that the jig is finally up on healthcare, our Republican friends have signaled they will turn to taxes. I hope they have learned the lessons of One of the reasons TrumpCare failed so spectacularly was that Republicans tried to rush and ram it through via a reconciliation process, even though it was deeply unpopular with the public. The last poll showed only 17 percent of Americans supported TrumpCare, so that means a large number even of Trump supporters were opposed to it.  Why was it so unpopular? Probably because TrumpCare would have given the wealthiest among us a monster tax cut while hammering older Americans and the middle class with higher costs for less care.  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: If you try to pass a Republican tax plan using the same reconciliation method in order to get a huge tax break for the wealthy and already profitable and powerful corporations, it will fail. The American people are not crying out for tax breaks on[[Page S1984]]the wealthiest God bless the wealthy. They are doing just fine without the tax breaks, but thus far it seems our Republican colleagues are headed in that direction.  Even though the President campaigned as a populist, his administration has been all hard-right, pro-corporate, pro-special interests, totally against the working people. If the President and Republicans in Congress continue in that direction, proposing policies that shift burdens off the wealthy and powerful, not aiming to help the middle class and working families, their efforts will continue to fail, and it will turn tax reform into a partisan issue. The White House says tax reform isn't partisan, but it surely will be if they propose massive tax cuts only for the wealthy. My prediction: If Republicans go down that road, the Republican tax scheme will meet the same fate as I hope they will not go down that road; I hope they will not.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

665,topic-id,1185,"Mr.President, first I will speak on the Supreme Last Thursday, I announced my opposition to Judge Neil Gorsuch and endeavored to explain why, on the merits, I don't believe he deserves to be elevated to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme  I listen to my friend, the distinguished majority leader, each morning. Since the beginning of this Congress, he has chalked up every Democratic request or objection in this body to ``sour grapes,'' to some leftover resentment from the election. It is just not true, but he keeps trying. Now he is trying the same strategy with Judge He repeatedly cites a quote by a friend of the judge's who, of course, said ``there is no principled reason'' to oppose this nomination, so it must be politics, the majority leader concludes. I respectfully but wholeheartedly disagree with the majority leader on this point.  There are several principled reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  First, Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he would be an independent check on a President who has shown almost no restraint from Executive overreach. He asserted independence but could not point to a single thing in his record to guarantee it.  He refused to publicly condemn what the President did when he went after the three-judge panel on the Ninth He had a case before them, and the President said: If they don't decide my way, they will be guilty of terrorism. I have never seen anything like that in all my years of politics. Judge Gorsuch refused to publicly condemn. He said privately to different people that he was disheartened. When President Trump said: He didn't mean me, Judge Gorsuch shrugged his shoulders, going along with what the President said.  Second, he was unable to convince me that he would be a mainstream Justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology. His career, his early writings, and his judicial record suggest not a neutral legal mind but instead someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology. He was championed by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and has not shown 1 inch of difference between his views and theirs. I would ask my colleagues this question: Are all these groups who are spending dark, secret, undisclosed money to support his nomination doing so because they just want a Justice on the Court who will ``call balls and strikes''? I doubt it. Some here may agree with the Heritage Foundation, but they are not a mainstream organization. They are on the far right. That is their right to be. But their advocacy of Judge Gorsuch suggests he is not a ``balls and strikes'' guy.  Finally, Judge Gorsuch is someone who almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak and corporations over working That is what his record shows. Judge Gorsuch repeatedly sided with insurance companies that wanted to deny disability benefits to employees, and in employment discrimination cases, he sided with employers the great majority of the time.  He wrote--in dissent--that trucking company executives were right to fire truckdriver Alphonse Maddin for leaving his trailer in order to save his life. And just last week, we saw another example of how extreme Judge Gorsuch's views are when the Supreme Court unanimously rebuked his interpretation of the Individuals with Disabilities In the opinion of even Justice Thomas, the educational rights Judge Gorsuch would allow to disabled students under the law amount to no education at all.  Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to disabuse us of all of those objections was in the hearing process, but he declined to substantively answer question after question. Absent a real description of his judicial philosophy, all we have to go on is his record--a record that landed Judge Gorsuch on the lists of the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage President Trump, of course, selected Judge Gorsuch off those preapproved conservative lists, as he promised he would during his campaign.  To claim, as the majority leader does, that Judge Gorsuch is simply a neutral judge is belied by his history since his college days, his own judicial record, and the manner of his selection.  These are principled reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, even if people on the other side disagree with them. We need a Justice who will be an independent check on the We need someone who will consider fairly the plight of average citizens, not further tip the scales of justice in favor of already powerful corporations. Judge Gorsuch--his record and his performance in the hearing--did nothing to show me he could be that kind of  So when Republicans said that if Democrats won't support Judge Gorsuch, we won't support any Republican-nominated judge, that is simply not true. It may be hard for us to support anyone from a list culled by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, but we have several reasons to be concerned with Judge Gorsuch specifically.  For all the hand-wringing by my friends on the other side of the aisle that they cannot imagine Democrats voting against Judge Gorsuch, I would like to remind them that only three--three--of the current Senators on the Republican side voted for either of President Obama's confirmed nominees, and all of them went along with my friend the majority leader's unprecedented plan to refuse President Obama's third nominee, Judge Garland, even a hearing or a vote for nearly a year.  Which brings us back to the present day, where we Democrats have participated in a fair, transparent, and thorough process of advice and consent. Now that the time to decide whether to provide consent approaches, we take that responsibility seriously. A lifetime appointment on the highest Court of the land is not something to be taken lightly.  To participate in hearings and a thorough process--something we were denied--does not mean you have to be a rubberstamp. After a thorough review of Judge Gorsuch's record, many of my colleagues and I have concluded we cannot consent.[[Page S2019]]  If Judge Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, it will not be because Democrats are being obstructionists, it will be because he failed to convince 60 Senators that he belongs on the Supreme  My friend the majority leader made the decision to break 230 years of Senate precedent by holding this seat open for over a year. If the nominee cannot earn the support of 60 Senators, the answer is not to break precedent by fundamentally and permanently changing the rules and traditions of the Senate; the answer is to change the nominee. This idea that if Judge Gorsuch doesn't get 60 votes, the majority leader has to inexorably change the rules of the Senate--that idea is utter bunk.  It is the free choice of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pursue a change in rules if that is what they decide. And I would remind the majority leader that he doesn't come to this decision with clean hands. He blocked Merrick Garland for over a year. We wouldn't even be here if Judge Garland had been given fair consideration. That is why we are here today--not because of any                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2018-2.txt,1036,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,March
688,topic-id,306,"Mr.President, finally, on the wall--a place where there may be more agreement between some of us than on Judge Garland--last night we learned that the Trump administration will be seeking deep cuts to critical domestic programs in order to pay for a border wall. The administration is asking the American taxpayer to cover the cost of a wall--unneeded, ineffective, and absurdly expensive--that Mexico was supposed to pay for. He is cutting programs that are vital to the middle class in order to get that done.  They want to cut the New Starts Transportation Program and TIGER grants. These are the lifeblood of our road and tunnel and bridge building efforts. Build a wall or repair or build a bridge or tunnel or road in your community? What a choice. They want to cut off NIH funding for cancer research to pay for the wall. How many Americans would support that decision? They want to cut programs that create jobs and improve people's lives--all so the President can get his ``big, beautiful wall''--a wall that we don't need and that will be utterly ineffective. Think about that. The President wants to slow down cancer research and make the middle-class taxpayer shoulder the cost of a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. He wants to cut funding for roads and bridges to build a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.  The proposed cuts the administration sent up last night will not receive the support of very many people, I believe, in this These cuts would be bad for the American people.

922,topic-id,1746,"Mr.President, I rise this morning on a few topics, but I first want to mention that last night many of us spent some time at the White House where we were regaled by the wonderful Marine and Army chorus, where there was talk about renewing a spirit of bipartisanship in  I am all for it. Of course, we Democrats hope that the President and Republicans in Congress will sit down with us in a true spirit of bipartisanship because so far in this Congress--the Republicans in this Congress so far--the Republican idea of bipartisanship has meant to both the President and the Republicans in Congress: We come up with our plan, and you Democrats should support it. That is not bipartisanship.  The Republican leader, the House Speaker, have come up with issue after issue, including a Supreme Court nominee, with no Democratic consultation, and then said: The only way you can achieve bipartisanship is just to vote with us.  You can't improve the healthcare system with only Republican votes on reconciliation, without consulting any Democrats, without a single sentence of Democratic input, and call that an attempt at bipartisanship.  You can't do an infrastructure package of tax credits and no real spending, and then ask for bipartisan support. And you certainly can't out-source your entire selection of Supreme Court Justices to be handpicked by the hard-right, special interest-dominated Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society, and then ask for us to vote for that nominee as a show of bipartisan support.  Bipartisanship means sitting down with the other side, getting our ideas, and hashing out a compromise. It does not mean proposing your policy--particularly when these policies and nominees are so far to the right--and then making an exhortation for bipartisanship and bemoaning the absence of it when Democrats don't go along with your way. I truly hope that the President and Republicans want to renew a spirit of bipartisanship, but it has to be real, it has to be meant, and their actions have to follow suit.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Well, Mr.President, let's talk about the Supreme Court because that exemplifies exactly what I am talking about. Over the last several weeks, my Republican friends have tried to paint Judge Neil Gorsuch as the beau ideal of a neutral and impartial judge. They insist that Judge Gorsuch is a straight down-the-middle guy, someone who will call the balls and strikes. The majority leader likes to cite a letter of a friend of the judge who says ``there is no principled reason'' to oppose his nomination. Of course, there are several principled reasons to object to Judge Today I would like to focus on one in particular: Judge Gorsuch's long career ties to conservative interests and conservative ideological groups.  The idea that Judge Gorsuch would simply be a neutral, mainstream Justice is belied by his career, his judicial record, and, perhaps most of all, the manner by which he was selected to serve on the Supreme He was culled from a list handpicked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, conservative organizations that have spent the last few decades simply trying to shift the balance of the courts way to the right. Most of my colleagues on the other side know how far to the right the Heritage Foundation is, and they often grumble at how they are pulling the party too far over, but Judge Gorsuch was handpicked by that group, along with the Federalist  Instead of consulting the Senate, President Trump outsourced his Supreme Court pick to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation long before an election even took place. The Constitution does not say the President shall appoint the Supreme Court Justices with the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups. It says he should appoint them with the advice and consent of the President Trump didn't consult the Senate; he never even considered it. He just consulted this list.  Surely my dear friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, must remember when President Clinton consulted him about his Supreme Court picks. Senator Hatch told the President not to select Bruce Babbitt and offered instead the names of Ginsburg and President Clinton listened to Senator Hatch and nominated them instead. Surely my good friend from Utah also remembers when he suggested to President Obama that Merrick Garland be nominated to the Supreme Court, calling him a fine man. President Obama listened and made him his pick.  President Trump is different from all of the past Presidents in so many ways, so many of them unfortunate, and here is one: Even before being elected to office, President Trump swore off the entire process and outsourced the advice and consent process to a list selected by two ultraconservative organizations.  Take the Heritage Foundation, for example. Are they down the middle? Are they unbiased? Well, let's listen to some of the things they believe in, which are way different from most It is a group that believes ``freedom'' means businesses have the right to discriminate against LGBT people. This is a group that believes ``limited government'' means eliminating resources for the Violence Against Women This is a group that believes a strong national defense means discriminatory Executive orders that bar immigrants and refugees from Muslim-majority countries. This is a group that holds extreme-right positions, a group that is far, far out of the American mainstream--and is even out of the Republican mainstream so many times--and they have handpicked Neil Gorsuch to have a seat on the highest Court in the land.  Does anyone think the Heritage Foundation or the Federalist Society would put on their list a judicial moderate who would only call balls and strikes? Does anyone think there would be all this outside, dark, undisclosed money being spent to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination if he were just someone who called balls and strikes? There is a reason all of this dark money is being spent to support him. There is a reason the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation liked Judge Gorsuch enough to put him on the President's short list. There is a reason the President pledged to select only from this list. He wanted to curry favor with skeptical hard-right, special interest-dominated conservatives during his campaign. So the idea that Judge Gorsuch would simply be some neutral Justice does not hold water.  When Republicans say that if Democrats will not support Judge Gorsuch, we will not support any Republican-nominated judge, that is simply not true. We have several reasons to be concerned with Judge Gorsuch specifically, and specifically one of those things we are concerned about is that he was pushed forward from the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society, groomed by billionaire conservatives like Mr.Anschutz, another hard-right, special interest person.  Judge Gorsuch had a chance. Most of us waited till after the hearings because at the hearings he had a chance to distance himself from these views, but he refused to substantively answer question after question.  So if Judge Neil Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, which, by the way, the American people believe is the appropriate standard for a Supreme Court nominee, it is not because Democrats are being obstructionists; it is because he failed to convince 60 Senators that he belongs on the Supreme In that event, the answer is not to permanently change the rules and traditions of the Senate; the answer is to change the nominee and do what President Clinton and President Obama did before they nominated people: Consult the other party for some semblance of bipartisanship.  The majority is trying to make this a binary choice: Confirm Gorsuch or change the rules. It is not so; it is just not so. The idea that if Judge Gorsuch can't get 60, we must immediately move to change the rules is a false narrative. If the majority chooses to go that route, they do so at their own volition. No one is forcing them to do so,[[Page S2058]]except maybe the Heritage Foundation and groups like the Federalist                              Border Wall  Mr.President, there is one thing I want to say about the wall. I talked about the wall yesterday, and I am not going to elaborate, but I would like to add to the Record a quote about the wall from none other than the Secretary of Interior, former Republican Congressman, Mr.Zinke, from Here is what he said. This is his quote about the wall, and I hope my colleagues will listen:       The border is complicated, as far as building a physical      wall. . . . The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you      going to put the wall? We're not going to put it on our side      and cede the river to And we're probably not going to      put it in the middle of the river.                          Affordable Care Act  Mr.President, finally, on the Affordable Care Act, today, 44 Senate Democrats are sending a letter to the President who puts onto paper our official offer to work with him to improve the existing law.  Last Friday, in the wake of TrumpCare's defeat in the House, I was deeply concerned to hear the President say that he wants the Affordable Care Act to ``explode.'' The President and his HHS Secretary, Tom Price, have significant latitude to either improve the law or undermine it. So far, the President has undermined the law. These were all before the vote: He discontinued the advertising campaigns to get people to sign up for coverage and worked behind the scenes to give insurers flexibility to offer less generous care, and, still, the President's Executive order directing agencies to help him repeal and replace the ACA is hanging out there after the defeat or lack of a vote in the House, causing instability in the market and giving Federal agencies permission to undermine the law. That should be rescinded.  What our letter says today is simple: If the President drops these efforts to undermine the law, we Democrats stand ready to sit down with him and with our Republican friends across the aisle in good faith to discuss a bipartisan approach to improving our healthcare system.  It is time to work together to make healthcare even more affordable but not to encourage or root for the failure of the law that would have devastating consequences for millions of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1151,topic-id,1095,"Mr.President, as we prepare to consider the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, I would like to take a moment this morning to discuss the false choice Republicans are presenting about his confirmation.  The Republican majority wants everyone to believe that by the end of next week one of two things must happen: Either Judge Gorsuch will pass with 60 votes or they must exercise the nuclear option and change the rules of the Senate so that he can pass on a simple majority vote. As Republicans tell it, one inexorably follows from the other. They are talking about next week as if they have no choice but to go nuclear if Judge Gorsuch doesn't earn 60 votes.  It is absolutely false. It is complete hokum. This is not some inevitable showdown. The Republicans control this body. They can choose to go nuclear or not. The ball is entirely in[[Page S2121]]their court. In the past, when a President's nominee didn't get enough support for confirmation for whatever reason, the President just picked another nominee. If it comes to that, that is what this President should do. If Judge Gorsuch fails to garner 60 votes, the answer isn't to irrevocably change the rules of the Senate, the answer is to change the nominee. It is not Gorsuch or bust.  The Republicans are playing a game of unnecessary and dangerous brinksmanship. If it comes to a rules change--and I sincerely hope that it does not for the sake of the grand traditions of this body, for the sake of the advice and consent clause of the Constitution, but if it does--it will be squarely on the shoulders of the Republican Party and the Republican leader--a Republican Party that broke 230 years of precedent when it refused to even consider President Obama's nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland, with almost a year left in Obama's There was no vote--not even a hearing--and Republicans accuse Democrats of the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee? What Republicans did to Merrick Garland was worse than a filibuster. They didn't even grant him the basic courtesy of a filibuster. Merrick Garland actually was a consensus nominee with Republican buy-in for the Supreme  Second, President Trump totally dispatched with the notion of ``advice and consent'' by pledging, before he was even elected, to nominate a Supreme Court Justice off of a preapproved list of hard-right, conservative judges put together by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Contrast that with Bill Clinton, who sought and took the advice of the Republican Judiciary Chairman, Orrin Hatch, in nominating Justices Ginsburg and He did not pick his first choice, Bruce Babbitt, because Orrin Hatch said that would be a bad idea and could not bring the kind of unity we needed. How about Democratic President Obama, who took, again, the advice of Orrin Hatch when he picked Merrick There was bipartisan consultation. That is why the process worked. There is none now. The Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society are not simply mainstream organizations, as every Republican knows, but they are organizations on the hard-right of the Republican side who often threaten Republicans if they don't vote the right way--the far-right way. So we are not talking about ``advise and consent.'' We are talking about something that was done without any consultation and a political move by a President to shore up his base with the hard rightwing.  What President Trump did was worse than simply ignoring article II of the President Trump actively sought the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups instead of the That is another Supreme Court-related precedent that the Republicans discard. Because President Trump made that choice, now Republicans are saying they have no choice but to change the rules? It is illogical and self-serving. For all the handwringing of my friends on the other side of the aisle that they cannot imagine Democrats voting against Judge Gorsuch, I would like to remind them that only three of the current Senators on the Republican side voted for either of President Obama's confirmed nominees. Let me repeat that. Only three of the current Senators on the Republican side voted for either one of President Obama's confirmed nominees. Most voted for neither, and every single one of them lined up to conduct an ``audacious'' partisan blockade of Merrick  It is true the norms and precedents and traditions have been eroded by both sides. We changed the rules for lower court nominees in 2013 after years of unprecedented obstruction by Republicans on routine circuit and district court judges. Still, I am on the record as regretting that decision. But this is in an order of magnitude much greater than that. This is the Supreme This is the Court that is the final arbiter of U.law and the We Democrats have serious principled concerns about Judge Gorsuch, his record, his long history of ties to ultraconservative interests, and his almost instinctive tendency to side with special power interests over average citizens. We have principled concerns about how Judge Gorsuch was groomed by hard-right conservative billionaires, like Mr.Phillip We have principled concerns about how Judge Gorsuch was selected off a preapproved list of conservative judges made by organizations who spent three decades campaigning to move our judiciary far to the right.  Judge Gorsuch had a chance to answer these concerns in his hearings. We were all waiting and hoping, but our questions were met with practiced evasions. He couldn't even answer whether Brown v. Board was decided correctly.  Instead of considering the possibility of another nominee should Judge Gorsuch fail to reach 60 votes, our Republican friends are threatening to press the big red button for him.  Again, the Republicans are creating a false choice--Judge Gorsuch or the nuclear option--in an attempt to avoid the blame if they change the rules, and it just doesn't wash. The Republicans control this body. They are in the driver's seat, and they are the only reason that we are here today. They held this seat open for over 1 year so that this President could install someone handpicked by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society--a lifetime appointment for this President, whose campaign is under investigation by the FBI for potential ties to  I just repeat to my Republican colleagues: You don't need to change the rules if Judge Gorsuch doesn't get 60 votes. You are not required to do so. You just need to change the nominee and do some bipartisan consultation as Presidents of both parties have done in the past.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2120-2.txt,1036,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,30.0,March

1189,topic-id,613,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on the pending business of the CRA that would allow States to discriminate against women's healthcare providers.  Before I begin, I want to recognize the members of the HELP Senator Murray, who understands this issue as well as anyone in our caucus and speaks powerfully about it, has been such a great leader on these issues, even in these difficult times when we are in the minority. I think our entire caucus is grateful to her and all of the members of the HELP It is an outstanding group of people.  As my colleagues have explained, this CRA would empower States to discriminate against healthcare providers, specifically title X family planning providers. The practical result of this measure is that State legislatures would pass laws to deny certain providers the funding they need to operate, which would prevent access to family planning and preventive care for millions of American women.  This CRA is just another example of the Republican war on women. It would let States treat women as second-class citizens who do not deserve the same access to healthcare as men. Some States say this is about abortion, but let me be clear. This is not about abortions. In fact, title X funding cannot be used to pay for abortion services. Some of our Republicans who are sort of tied in a knot on abortion say they are for other kinds of health services, contraception and things like that, but this would take that away. Our Republican friends could not get TrumpCare through, which sought to shut down Planned Parenthood for a year. Now they have moved on to this measure. It is just bad policy.  Title X clinics are a critical resource for women, especially in rural areas. This bill would hurt those areas most. Many of my Republican friends represent rural areas. I would like to remind them that in many of these places--and I have several in Upstate New York--these clinics are the only family planning and preventive care services that are available. Sometimes they are the only healthcare services available at all. I am sure that is why two of my Republican colleagues, with a great deal of courage--the Senators from Maine and Alaska--voted against moving to debate on this measure. They know that it would hurt women and hurt families in their States, particularly in the rural areas, and, of course, Maine and Alaska are both rural  For the second time this year, the Republicans had to beckon Vice President Pence down from the White House to break a tie here in the Senate on a measure that has bipartisan opposition.  President Trump, who once said, ``No one has more respect for women than I do,'' sent Vice President Pence down here to the Senate to break a tie on a bill that would allow States to discriminate against women's health providers. The next time the President says, ``No one has more respect for women than I do,'' I would ask the women of America to not look at his words but his actions because this is just another example in which the President has said one thing, but his policies have done exactly another.  I urge my Republican friends, particularly those in rural States, where this could really hurt, to please think about it and vote against this We only need one more vote to stop this resolution that would allow States to dramatically reduce the access for women to essential healthcare services.

I was going to come up to the microphone and sort of do the blast away, but let me back away.  A number of things I have heard in this debate from the left and even a couple of the things from my side, okay, you are conflating all sorts of things that this bill doesn't do. This bill is three pages.  So can I ask a question? If I came to you right now and said, ``Tell me that the EPA actually has the right rule sets for hydrocarbons, if it has the right rule set for PM10, it has the right rule sets for ozone,'' you would say, ``Well, I have a peer-reviewed study that says this.'' I want to make the argument, in today's technology, why[[Page H2546]]shouldn't your university, why shouldn't the really smart person who has the computer system in their basement, why shouldn't the new statistical packages that are on these things be allowed to take the data the taxpayers have paid for and work it and model it and bounce it off other types of datasets and ask is the way we model and regulate rational?  This bill doesn't reduce regulations. In many ways, it allows us all to participate in the citizen science to understand whether we are doing it the right way.  Why is the left so scared of citizen scientists, of university scientists, of people who are just darned interested in the matching of different types of datasets?  You and I might find out we are doing things the wrong way. You and I might find out we are not doing enough. You and I may find out we are doing far too much. But stop being afraid of people having access to the information. If society is going to live under a regulatory environment, then society deserves access to the information that creates those regulations.  Public information for public policy, why is that so feared? Why is there so much trust in the bureaucracy instead of science and information?  I want to argue with you that, in today's world, when we are on the cusp, where sensors are going to be attached to this, taking thousands of readings in our communities, that that information is just as noble as something that is locked up in the cabinet where none of us can actually see the base datasets.

Now, accept much of what we do here in Washington, D.C., if not almost all of it, is about the cash, and it is one of the ugly secrets that is not a secret, but we all pretend. It is always about the money.  Let's try something novel. Let's actually--this was an inspector general's report under the Obama administration. Why wouldn't we step up and respect it? It was very simple.  Hey, we need some more diversity on these advisory boards. And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had people advising us on air quality policy in non-attainment areas, or in regional interests that also weren't selling products, selling reports, making money off data with the EPA?  I mean, if it was reversed, if it was some other agency, if this same set of ethical lapses was reversed, I believe the left would be apoplectic. But the fact of the matter is that so many of these individual organizations that are represented on these advisory boards, that are making money from the EPA, even though they are advising in their own behalf, happen to be friends of the left. That makes it okay.  The ethical standards are the ethical standards. I have no concept how the left can oppose the concept of structured diversity.  Why shouldn't those of us from the Southwest, where substantial portions[[Page H2572]]of my State are Native American, have a voice?

19,topic-id,1623,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation.  This rule is a fair rule that adequately provides both sides of the aisle with ample time to debate the merits of the underlying legislation. In fact, the Rules Committee thought it was so important that ample time be provided to this debate, that we are provided 4 hours of general debate on the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, in honor of our former President, Ronald Reagan, I wear brown today. The former President, when he was President, believed that wearing brown was good luck to him and good luck for the things which he was undertaking. So, in honor of Ronald Reagan, I, too, wear my brown jacket today.  Mr.Speaker, it has become abundantly clear that ObamaCare has failed the American people. Our Nation's healthcare system today is broken and only getting worse under the current law, known as the Affordable Care Act, or  Simply put, ObamaCare is collapsing, and it is collapsing fast. Options and choices are disappearing for consumers, and an anticompetitive marketplace has been created that firmly harms patients.  How bad is it? Nearly one-third of all U.counties currently have only one insurer offering plans on their State's exchanges. That is a government-created monopoly, Mr.Speaker, and that kills the free market, meaning no choices for the American people and higher costs are what the American consumer and the healthcare market are finding.  And it is only continuing to get worse. As more and more insurers leave the marketplace, prices will continue to rise, forcing healthy individuals to make economic decisions not to purchase health care, creating a self-defeating spiral of rising costs and less options. That is why we must act, and act today, which is what we are doing.  It is no wonder that in such a government-controlled system that premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent on the ObamaCare exchanges this year alone. And it is no wonder that some 19.2 million taxpayers chose to outright pay the individual mandate penalty or claimed an exemption. What this means is that ObamaCare is not a good option to these 19.2 million people.  Mr.Speaker, the American people, I believe, sent us to Washington, D.C., to fix this issue. They are telling us directly: this must be fixed now. And people certainly outside of Washington resent the Federal Government telling them how to purchase health care and what that healthcare marketplace would look like. But we really do not have to tolerate this. We do not have to agree that we will accept the status quo.  Mr.Speaker, I believe the American people are smart. I believe the American people want independence, they love freedom, and they want to know that they can make their own choices, because they believe they make better choices than a one-size-fits-all plan out of Washington, D. What brings us here today, however, most assuredly, is a broken system. So, Republicans offer today H.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, which will eliminate Washington's one-size-fits-all healthcare policy for the American people. It dismantles the disastrous ObamaCare taxes that are strangling the working middle class and diminishing America's economic prowess. We will end this with the opportunity to vote today to change the status quo.  It eliminates the onerous employer and individual mandates. It prohibits health insurers from denying coverage and helps young adults access health care by getting back into the marketplace while stabilizing and restoring the free market opportunities for all  Mr.Speaker, the American people are counting on Washington getting it right this time. What does getting it right mean? Getting it right means giving them the opportunity to exit a bad system and to have a better chance at a new system.  This rule provides House Republicans with the opportunity to restore exactly that--a better healthcare plan to provide the middle class and low-income families who have been left behind on either side of the aisle, and it gives them an opportunity to have tax advantages in the employer marketplace.  Mr.Speaker, today, we will be dissecting this into three separate areas. We will have Members of the Republican majority here to explain that and the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, the majority is rushing to congratulate itself for finally having a bill to repeal the Affordable Care For 7 years, Republicans had nothing to actually replace the law with, but that didn't stop them from making one empty political promise after another.  And after all that, what do we have in front of us today? This bill will take away health care from 24 million hardworking It forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing out-of-pocket costs. It is a crushing age tax, forcing Americans age 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Not to mention the $880 billion cut to Medicaid or the fact that it steals from Medicare, shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and ransacking funds that seniors depend on to get the long-term care they need.  I don't see anything there to be excited about. But then again, I come from the old-fashioned school of thought that we should actually take care of our fellow citizens as they grow older, rather than tossing them off the ship without a life preserver.  It is no wonder that after developing such an ill-conceived and far-reaching bill on the fly, the majority has had to try and jam this legislation through our  First, they rushed this bill through the committee process without holding a single hearing, and without the benefit of a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office score outlining its costs and impacts.  Then the majority came out of a back room somewhere and filed four managers' amendments in the dark of[[Page H2376]]night to try to appease the conservative and moderate holdouts, including the infamous Buffalo bribe. The Republican leadership has been trying to strong-arm their conference into voting for this bill all week, and nobody knows how today's vote will go. The only thing we do know is that this is a terrible bill that is only getting worse, not better.  This thing has been a mess from beginning to end. Now, I know our President prides himself on his negotiating skills, but this seems more like the art of no deal to me, no matter what the final vote tally looks like.  That brings us to this early morning, when we met at 7 a.m. in the Rules Committee to report out this rule, which rewrites the bill to make it far worse.  Last night, we were presented with a provision, concocted in some back room, that boggles the mind with its cynicism. So what is this mysterious grand bargain that will appease the Republican Conference and finally buy Speaker Ryan enough votes to pass this disaster of a bill? Well, Mr.Speaker, it is so cartoonishly malicious that I can picture someone twirling their mustache as they drafted it in their secret Capitol lair last night.  Republicans are killing the requirements that insurance plans cover essential health benefits--essential health benefits. Now, perhaps you are wondering: What are these so-called essential benefits? Well, I will give you a partial list: emergency room trips, maternity care, mental health care and substance abuse treatment, and prescription drugs. These are the types of exotic, extravagant benefits that Republicans apparently don't think are important for working Americans to be able to afford.  It would be literally unbelievable if we weren't here considering it right now, Mr.Now, I have been awake since before dawn--thanks to our Rules Committee meeting--so I know that this isn't a nightmare. We are actually voting on a bill with a backroom deal, made in the dark of night, that would take away any guarantee that plans would cover these basic essential benefits.  And, of course, we have no idea what the costs will be or how many people it will affect. We can't know those things until we get an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which, obviously, we will not have before we vote on this reckless legislation.  And that is the real problem. Because every time you come out of a back room, this bill gets worse. For the sake of our country, maybe we should consider putting locks on the back rooms you huddle in.  President Trump keeps talking about crowd size. My colleagues across the aisle keep talking about page size. This morning, in the Rules Committee, Republicans kept saying that the fifth manager's amendment is only 4 pages long. How bad could it be?  Well, they need to stop worrying about size and pay more attention to how this bill will affect regular, working These 4 pages are the worse 4 pages on this planet because of the terrible consequences it will have on real people. It will be devastating for millions and millions of  So, Mr.Speaker, instead of rushing this horrendous bill, patched together with backroom deals, to the floor and voting on it just hours after seeing the final product, we should be working together in a bipartisan way to improve people's lives, and certainly not putting them at risk. My colleagues seem too concerned about winning at any cost to stop and think about the consequences for millions upon millions of This is a lousy bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We had an opportunity to quote the Bible, Janis Joplin, and ZZ Top when we were doing our hearings. We had so much time with each other, and I enjoyed the hours and hours that we had to debate these essential items.  But the other side of the story is essential health benefits are not being done away with. They are being transferred entirely to States have asked for the ability to manage their own money, and manage their own people's benefits of what would be required in the So in no way should a person take away, well, we just did away with it. In fact, we transferred the authority and the responsibility of essential health benefits to the States because Governors have been asking for this.  Mr.Speaker, I want to take just a moment to explain what I believe is at the heart of the legislation and really, in reality, the key to fixing health care. It is the second part of this.  We heard the gentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Burgess, speak about the Energy and Commerce portions. I now would like to take a minute to talk about the portions that come directly out of the Ways and Means  The gentleman, Mr.Brady, from The Woodlands, Texas, today, spoke about many of these; but at the heart of it, 170 million Americans currently receive their health care through an employee-employer tax advantage or tax benefits, an untaxed benefit whereby people who have an employer who can provide their health care, it is not taxed--pretaxed to the employee, allowing them to have a good healthcare system. Well, all the while, millions of Americans pay higher premiums out of their pockets in the individual market. Those are people that do not have an employer who is able to help them. So that is not fair. That does not help these people.  What we are doing here is putting together an addition of, really, a great Republican idea; and it takes the important step to provide the same tax-free benefits for those employer-sponsored plans that we will give to regular employees, and it is called a tax credit. This tax credit is going to work because it allows every single American that does not receive the tax benefit at work to get it for themselves.  Who is this? Well, quite honestly, it is small-business owners; it is low-income workers; it is entrepreneurs. It includes, really, a lot of real estate agents and people that work for a small business, maybe heating and air-conditioning systems like we have all across this country. It will give their families an opportunity.  How much money? Well, we will provide them between $2,000 and $14,000 a year for their families to be able to have these opportunities to purchase a nongovernment healthcare plan, meaning that, as they would go to the marketplace, we are going to help these people through a tax credit available January 1, providing them with an opportunity to purchase health care on a benefit basis.  Why is this important? It saves money because what it does, it creates two things: a family then has an insurance plan, including a healthcare component that goes to the hospitalization; and secondly, it gives them an opportunity to have their own doctor or healthcare plan that they choose. This is important because many of these people end up in the hospital in the most expensive kind of way we can provide health care: at the emergency room.  So this gives these families parity in the marketplace. We believe that that is important and is another part of this Republican healthcare plan.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

52,topic-id,1640,"Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am prepared to close.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 87 patient and provider organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which is strongly opposed to this bill.                                                   March 20, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: The undersigned      organizations write to express grave concern about proposals      put forth in the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to alter the      fundamental structure and purpose of Medicaid, a vital source      of health care for patients with ongoing health needs.       We feel compelled to speak out against proposals to phase      out Medicaid expansion and implement per capita caps, which      threaten the ability of Medicaid to provide critical health      care services to many of our most vulnerable citizens. These      proposals aim to achieve cost savings of approximately $880      billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, at the      expense of tens of millions of patients who rely on Medicaid      for life-sustaining care. While we appreciate the      opportunities we have had to work with your staff, we cannot      support the Medicaid provisions in this bill and cannot      accept policies that prioritize cutting costs by limiting      patients' access to care.                   Medicaid is Critical for Patients       Medicaid is a crucial source of coverage for patients with      serious and chronic health care needs. Pregnant women depend      on Medicaid, which covers roughly 50 percent of all births      including many high-risk pregnancies. Medicaid covers cancer      patients: nearly one-third of pediatric cancer patients were      enrolled in Medicaid in 2013 and approximately 1.52 million      adults with a history of cancer were covered by Medicaid in      2015. Over fifty percent of children and one-third of adults      living with cystic fibrosis rely on Medicaid to get the      treatments and therapies they need to preserve their health.      Nearly half of children with asthma are covered by Medicaid      or CHIP and adults with diabetes are disproportionally      covered by Medicaid as well. The patients we represent are      eligible for Medicaid through various pathways, including      through income-related and disability criteria.                         Reject Per Capita Caps       The proposal to convert federal financing of Medicaid to a      per capita cap system is deeply troubling. This policy is      designed to reduce federal funding for Medicaid, forcing      states to either make up the difference with their own funds      or cut their programs by reducing the number of people they      serve and the health benefits they provide.       For patients with ongoing health care needs, this means      that Medicaid may no longer cover the care and treatments      they need, including breakthrough therapies and technology.      In order to save money, the per capita caps are set to grow      more slowly than expected Medicaid costs under current law.      As the gap between the capped allotment and actual costs      increases over time, states will be forced to constrain      eligibility, reduce benefits, lower provider payments, or      increase cost-sharing. Moreover, by capping the federal      government's contribution to Medicaid in this manner, states      will be less able to cover the cost of new treatments. This      could be devastating for people with serious diseases, for      whom groundbreaking treatments represent a new lease on life.      For people with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and other diseases,      new therapies can be game changers that improve quality of      life and increase life expectancy. In fact, we have already      seen Medicaid programs respond to current budget constraints      by using clinically inappropriate criteria to restrict access      to therapies old and new. A per capita cap will only      exacerbate the downward pressure on Medicaid budgets and will      further reduce access to these therapies for patients.       Pairing financing reforms with increased flexibility, as      has often been proposed, would further undermine Medicaid's      role as a safety net for patients. Without current guardrails      provided by federal requirements--coupled with reduced      federal funding--states will have the authority to reduce      benefits and eligibility as they see fit and to impose other      restrictions, such as waiting periods and enrollment caps.      These policies have serious implications for patients--for a      person with cancer, enrollment freezes and waiting lists      could mean a later-stage diagnosis when treatment costs are      higher and survival is less likely. For a person with      diabetes, this would risk the ability to adequately manage      the disease. Many of our patients rely on costly services      that will be quickly targeted for cuts if states are given      such flexibility, so it is imperative that current federal      safeguards remain in place.                      Maintain Medicaid Expansion       While the AHCA has been described as preserving Medicaid      expansion for those already enrolled in coverage, we are      concerned that estimates show that eliminating the enhanced      match for any enrollee with even a small gap in coverage      would actually result in millions of people losing      coverage. By eliminating the enhanced federal match for      any enrollee with a gap in coverage, eventually states      will be on the hook for billions of dollars to continue      covering this population--an insurmountable financial      hurdle. Additionally, seven states have laws that would      effectively end Medicaid expansion immediately or soon      thereafter when the expansion match rate is eliminated.      Nearly half of adults covered by the Medicaid expansion      are permanently disabled, have serious physical or mental      conditions--such as cancer, stroke, heart disease,      arthritis, pregnancy, or diabetes--or are in fair or poor      health. Repealing Medicaid expansion will leave these      patients without coverage they depend upon to maintain      their health.       The proposed financing reforms are a fundamental shift away      from Medicaid's role as a safety-net for some of the most      vulnerable members of our society. Repealing Medicaid      expansion would leave millions without the health care they      rely on. Our organizations represent and provide care for      millions of Americans living with ongoing health care needs      who rely on Medicaid and we cannot support policies that pose      such a grave risk to patients.       We hope that we can continue our dialogue as you move      forward in this process to arrive at solutions that provide      all Americans with high-quality, affordable care regardless      of an individual's income, employment status, health status,      or geographic location.

This process has been awful. But this is even a sadder day for the American people.  I remind my colleagues that we are supposed to care about one another, especially the most vulnerable in our society. In this era of Trump, Washington has become a mean place. It is a place where it has become unfashionable to worry about the poor, about older Americans, and about those who struggle.  There is absolutely no justification for giving huge tax breaks to billionaires--$1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, and at the same time throwing 24 million people off of health care and denying millions more essential healthcare protections.  Twenty-four million people--my Republican colleagues have lost their human ability to feel what that means. That is the entire population of  Mr.Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues, but when I look at this bill and I read this bill, I have to wonder: What are you thinking? How could you do this?  I have come to the conclusion there are only two reasons--there are only two ways you can vote for this bill. One is you don't know what is in the bill; or two is you have to have a heart of stone, because this bill is shameful. It is going to hurt people. It is going to hurt your constituents.  Withdraw this bill or vote ``no'' on this bill, but this bill cannot become law. The health care and healthcare protections for the American people are too important.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all my colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--reject this. Vote ``no.''  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

53,topic-id,416,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by thanking our colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts leading the Rules Committee, and his ranking members as they came from each of the committees, some 50 hours' worth of hearings and markups, including some 16 hours in the Rules Committee to not only talk about and vet, but to understand more clearly what we would be voting on.  Mr.Speaker, today is a bill that is a compromise bill, no doubt about it. I had my own plan and I had my own ideas. I took 2 years to get involved in this process. It is difficult to write a healthcare bill. But it didn't have to be my bill; it had to be a bill that we could all work together on.  President Trump has been a part of that. President Trump took time out of his schedule to do this. It is important to the American people. President Trump, more than any single Member of Congress, gave the message to the American people about what was necessary and what he would do. He is going to live up to that, and we should, too.  Mr.Speaker, the bottom line to this whole thing is we are going to present a Republican plan, and we are going to stand behind what we sell. It is better for the American people. But make no mistake about it: we are transferring power, authority, and responsibility not just to States, but also to the American people. It will be up to them to make determinations about their own health care because, for the first time, we will allow some 50 million Americans to have a tax equity, an opportunity to use tax credits that will be available to families anywhere from $2,000 for an individual to $14,000 for a family.                              {time}  1030  This will empower people who have not found a fair shot at the tax advantages it will give them: small-business owners; the American people; the average worker in this country, including those who work two or three different jobs; as well as those who are uninsured. We believe it is a better shot, an opportunity. We are willing to put our name on it and behind it.  For these reasons, Mr.Speaker, I urge us to move forward. There will be 4 hours of debate that remain in this opportunity. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill.

680,topic-id,860,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about the importance of the Senate's vote to ratify the accession of Montenegro into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or I am confident we will see an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of our colleagues here in the Senate support Montenegro's effort to join This is in Montenegro's interest, it is in Europe's interest, and it is in the national security interest of the United  NATO is the most successful security alliance in history, and it is essential to the stability, freedom, and prosperity that Europe enjoys and that the United States has enjoyed, and, really, to that stability that has existed since after World War NATO has provided the security and stability for the freedoms we enjoy and the prosperity. Montenegro's accession to NATO will help the alliance become more resilient, and it will deter Russian aggression on Europe's eastern flank, which is why the alliance invited Montenegro to become its 29th member last year.  I agree that Montenegro is a small country, but it is geopolitically important. Its membership in NATO will complete the alliance's control of the Adriatic coastline, and that will strengthen NATO's southern border.  Since its independence from Serbia 10 years ago, Montenegro has pursued inclusion in Euro-Atlantic institutions, and it has been a good partner to For example, Montenegro has contributed ably to the mission in Afghanistan, which is the only time article 5 of NATO has been invoked. It was after the attacks of 9/11 on the United States, and our response was to go into Montenegro joined us, along with our other NATO allies in this effort.

After all, remember that the two major wars of the last century, World Wars I and II, started in the We need to do everything we can to maintain stability there. This is one of the things that I believe Montenegro's accession to NATO will help us do. We saw the increasing Russian influence and the increasing effort to destabilize the Balkans last year in Montenegro's fall elections.  Since those elections, Montenegrin authorities have arrested several people in connection with a coup attempt and a plot to assassinate Montenegro's Prime There is indisputable evidence that ties both violent plots back to Russia, which was trying to eliminate a high-profile supporter of Montenegro's accession to NATO and install, instead, a pro-Kremlin political party there. Montenegrin police are still working with international authorities to locate the suspected Russian masterminds of these efforts.  But when the bipartisan codel from the Senate and House, led by Senators McCain and Whitehouse, went to the Munich Security Conference in February, we had a chance to meet with Montenegro's Prime Minister He told us in very vivid detail about the efforts to assassinate him and about Russia's efforts to install instead a pro-Russian government. Do we really think that Mr.Putin, who desires nothing more than to weaken the NATO alliance, would work so hard to disrupt Montenegro's inclusion in NATO if he didn't think it would strengthen the alliance?  Approving Montenegro's accession to NATO would signal support for Montenegro's independence and sovereignty and for their continued efforts to move towards the West and away from It would also demonstrate our solidarity with countries like Montenegro that Vladimir Putin is trying to bully, especially in light of our own recent experience with Russian meddling in our Presidential election. Now is a critically important time to send Russia the message that we will not tolerate this behavior. Last fall, a bipartisan group of diplomats, national security experts, and former administration officials sent a letter to Congress urging quick action on Montenegro's accession.  Earlier this month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote a letter to Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer detailing the reasons Montenegro's accession to NATO is in our interest and urging that we schedule a prompt floor vote on the accession. Virtually all NATO members have already formally blessed Montenegro's inclusion in the alliance. So it is just the United States that hasn't taken this important step forward.  The case for the Senate to support Montenegro's NATO accession is overwhelming. That is why it is so frustrating that it has taken so long. With Senator Johnson, I cochaired the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on this subject back in September of last year. In December and again in January, the Foreign Relations Committee approved Montenegro's accession protocol, and efforts were made to secure the necessary agreement for the full Senate to do the same. These efforts have been blocked by just a few Senators, despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for approval.  I am glad that Montenegro's accession is finally getting the vote in the Senate that it deserves. The United States has long stood for freedom and democracy in Europe, and I urge my Senate colleagues to stand strong for freedom and democracy now by voting to approve Montenegro's accession to  I yield the floor.

1167,topic-id,1174,"Madam President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues in opposing this misguided measure, which would leave millions of women and families with fewer healthcare options, and it would drastically decrease women's access to basic primary and preventive health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings and HIV testing.  Make no mistake about it, as my colleagues have said, the primary target of this legislation is Planned For years now, we have seen Republican leaders in Congress attempt to defund this essential healthcare provider, which serves millions of women nationwide, including nearly 12,000 women in New Hampshire, most of them with incomes below or near the poverty line. The sad irony of these attacks is that study after study has shown that restricting access to birth control and other family planning methods actually increases the number of abortions.  The authoritative Guttmacher Institute estimates that in 2014 alone, contraceptive care provided under title X helped women avert more than 900,000 unintended pregnancies and 326,000 abortions. Without contraceptive care provided by title X funded centers, the U.rates of unintended pregnancy and preventable abortions would be an estimated 33 percent higher, and the teen pregnancy rate would be 30 percent higher.  At the end of the Obama administration, teen pregnancy in the United States was at its lowest point since we have been keeping track. As Senator Hirono said, these services don't provide abortions. Federal law expressly forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion, except to save the life of the mother.  So the real issue here is not about abortion. This is about ensuring that American women have access to the basic healthcare they need, where they want to receive it. This is just a mean-spirited effort to keep women from seeing the provider they want to see and getting care at rates they can afford. For 40 percent of women, their visit to a family planning center is the only care they receive annually.  In 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers. Planned Parenthood plays an essentially important role in delivering health services to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable individuals, including in rural areas.  I am sure that every person in this Chamber has received letters and emails and phone calls from constituents on this issue. They are pleading with us: Don't take away our access to healthcare from Planned  I received a letter from Sandra Sonnichsen of Goshen, She writes:       Planned Parenthood was my only affordable source of      gynecological healthcare for most of my life. I received      good, wise, and thoughtful care. I think it is not extreme to      say they saved my life. Abortions were not involved. They--  Meaning Planned Parenthood--     remain very important, especially for poor or uninsured      women. There are not enough alternate low cost women's      clinics available. Not providing birth control services to      women who want it is not a good economic or social solution.      Don't let it be defunded.  In a follow-up call, Sandra said that without Planned Parenthood, she would not have had any healthcare at all. Because her mother died of breast cancer, Sandra is deeply grateful that she has been able to receive mammograms, thanks to Planned  I also heard from Meredith Murray of Exeter, She says:       Nine years ago I graduated from college and immediately      began my journey to become a medical provider. . . . During      this time in my life, I was surviving almost entirely on      student loans. And I knew that during this time, especially,      I needed to ensure that I was doing all I could to prevent      pregnancy. . . . With my insurance--an IUD would have cost      $900. That was not possible for me to afford. Then I      remembered--Planned . . . I was informed, due to      title X funding, my IUD would be completely covered. I      continued to use Planned Parenthood services for the next 5      years for my routine screenings while in medical school. The      care I received was phenomenal. As I proceeded through my      medical training, I strived to be as kind, compassionate, and      knowledgeable as those who work Planned Parenthood health      centers. I am now a practicing medical provider, married, and      still using an IUD because Planned Parenthood offered me that      opportunity.  I received this letter from Samantha Fox of Bow, She writes:       In 2007, I was a 19-year-old just barely starting out when      I was denied health insurance due to a preexisting condition.      Had I been able to access affordable coverage, my preexisting      condition, a reproductive system disorder, would have been      easily manageable. . . . At that time, I was able to access      care through Planned Parenthood, which likely preserved my      ability to conceive in the future.  And finally, let me share this message from Robina Parise of Rye, She says:       I started utilizing the services at Planned Parenthood for      birth control when I was about 17 years old. . . . Planned      Parenthood made sure I was protected and healthy. They gave      me access to vital protection and healthcare when I could not      get it anywhere else. They regularly called me with reminders      to have exams and to pick up my prescription. Planned      Parenthood is the reason my husband and I were able to      graduate from high school and college. . . . I'm not sure      what our lives would be like now without their support.  I don't know. Do the people who are voting for this CRA believe it would be better to have allowed the people whom I just talked about--to prohibit their access to these healthcare services so that their lives would have been disrupted, so they might not have finished college, so we wouldn't have another doctor in the world, so they wouldn't be able to afford healthcare? I hope we will listen to our constituents who have been speaking out in passionate support of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics.  This is about respecting women's access to healthcare services, including millions of vulnerable women who have nowhere else to turn for essential care. This is also about respecting women's constitutionally protected right to make our own reproductive choices. We must not allow Congress to strip away investments in family planning clinics by allowing States to discriminate.  Finally, I want to point out that we haven't heard from any of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are voting for this measure about why they think it is so critical. I don't know. Maybe they are not willing to come to the floor and tell my constituents why they should be denied access to healthcare from the provider they want. Well, I am disappointed that we haven't heard from anyone who is willing to stand up and defend this vote. I hope they are going to have to defend it to the American people.

In 2016, four accidents occurred, and Belarus has failed to be upfront with Lithuania about any of them.  A 330-ton nuclear reactor shell was allegedly dropped from about 13 feet last summer. Belarus did not reveal anything about the incident until independent media reported it, and then downplayed it.  Building a nuclear power plant requires care in construction according to the most stringent standards with the utmost transparency, and for the best reasons. This plant fails on all four counts. It is in the wrong location. It has been irresponsibly handled.  Instead of transparency, we have seen stonewalling and obfuscation. Instead of making the most economic sense, this plant seems to make good geopolitical sense--and for Russia, not for  Mr.Speaker, let me be clear. No one here objects to the safe, secure design, construction, and running of a nuclear power plant. But the people of Lithuania are firmly opposed to irresponsible attitudes toward nuclear power, particularly so close to their most populous city.  This concern makes sense. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Environment and long-time observer of Eastern Europe, Mr.Speaker, I can assure you that the people of the United States have no better friend than the people of  Lithuanians have the right and the responsibility to ensure their and their children's environmental security.

Until these issues are resolved, Mr.Speaker, I cannot fault the Lithuanian people for their concerns about the Astravets nuclear power plant. I share their concerns.

Sean Spicer said the President made women's empowerment a priority throughout the campaign, but earlier today, Vice President Pence traveled to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote to move ahead on a resolution to undermine women's access to preventive healthcare. That doesn't sound like women's empowerment to me.  Title X was enacted in 1970. It passed the Senate unanimously at that time and was signed into law by a Republican Title X is the only Federal healthcare program dedicated solely to providing comprehensive family planning and other related preventive healthcare services so important to women, as well as preventive services for men.  Last year alone, 4 million women and men at 4,000 health centers all across our country got basic care because of title X funding--critical Pap tests to head off cases of cervical cancer, counseling to help women plan for a healthy pregnancy, contraception, breast exams, HIV testing, vaccinations. These services prevented 87,000 preterm or low birth weight babies and 2,000 cases of cervical cancer. These health services also save money. The taxpayer saves $7 for every $1 invested in preventive healthcare.  For more than 2 million people, the title X funded clinic is their only source of healthcare. This matters to small towns and rural communities all across Michigan, as well as all across the country. Title X funds clinics in three-fourths of all the counties in the United In Michigan, you can benefit from the services in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where I will be this weekend, where funds support the health department in Iron County, or the Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette--at the opposite end of the State, down in the southeastern corner--where funds support the health department in Monroe  So what are we voting on today? Plain and simple, this is an effort to take away women's family planning and other healthcare services. Right now, title X funds are awarded solely based on the provider's ability to serve the patient, as it should be. Republicans want to discriminate against certain family planning services, certain providers, and reduce access to this care, frankly, based on politics or their own personal beliefs.

As you can imagine, building a State out of a frontier, particularly one so far away from the rest of the country and in such an extreme climate, was challenging, to say the least. It demanded, and still does, a certain kind of person with a certain kind of toughness, vision, and a determination to work for the good of all. Let me give you an example of what it has required.

Senator Sumner was born on January 6, 1811, in Boston, He was a lawyer, a professor, and then a politician. He was a man of purpose, principle, and many, many words and opinions. In fact, he was nearly caned to death while working in the Senate Chambers, by one of his colleagues--a congressman from the South--for expressing his opinions on the horrors of slavery. It was a deplorable act, and it cast a pall of shame over this body for years. Senator Sumner never really recovered, but after a long convalescence, he set his sights on the Alaska  He was skeptical, at first, until Secretary of State Seward got his ear, and he immersed himself into the accounts of the promise of this new territory, which turned him into an ardent supporter. On April, 8, 1867, Senator Sumner, using only notecards, gave a 3-hour speech on the Senate floor about our  He spoke of Alaska's abundant resources. He saw the Pacific as the ocean of the future and argued that Alaska is the key to that future. He spoke of the treasures--the gold in our land, the veins of coal, our huge mineral deposits, and the treasures below the Arctic He talked about the ``multitudes of fish,'' the thousands of acres of timber, and the opening of new trade routes.  He and others saw in Alaska the ``Eden of the North''--a future which would entail up to 1 million self-sufficient Americans supported by the resources of the land. Owning Alaska would give us greater control of the next ``great theater of action'' in the Arctic and Asia-Pacific, for both national security and economic reason.  In the new territory of Alaska, ``Commerce will find new arms; the country new defenders, the national flag new hands to bear it aloft,'' Senator Sumner argued. A ``boundless and glorious future,'' awaits, he and other supporters argued.  Senator Sumner ended his epic 1867 speech by arguing that the whole territory, not just the peninsula, should be given the name by the people who lived here. ``It should be indigenous, original, coming from the soil,'' he said. ``Alaska,'' he concluded, ``the great land.''  The day after Sumner's Senate speech, the once-skeptical U.Senate approved the purchase by a vote of 37 to 2. One hundred and fifty years later, Alaska has made good on that early promise.

1223,topic-id,563,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the bipartisan Veterans Choice Program Improvement I will start my remarks by saying that Chairman Isakson was here earlier, and he had a meeting he had to get to. Johnny has been through a tough surgery, and it is good to have Johnny back. But the fact of the matter is he supports this bill. He is an original cosponsor of this bill. The same could be said of Senator Blumenthal, who also had a meeting and wanted to be here, once again. We heard from Senator Schatz earlier. This bill truly has bipartisan support, not only in the VA Committee but also in this body.  The reason people support this piece of legislation is because it brings much needed reforms to the Choice Program while ensuring that veterans can access care in their communities. It is a good bill.  A few years back, the Choice Program was established with the very best of intentions. In my home State of Montana, it is a fact that veterans were waiting far too long for an appointment at the VA and oftentimes had to drive over 100 miles for the appointment. The Choice Program was supposed to allow these veterans to access care closer to home. Unfortunately, it has not been working out the way it should, and veterans have been inundated with redtape and a government contractor that struggles to schedule appointments and pay providers on time. That is why we all worked together--Democrats and Republicans and even Independents--on this bill to put forth these much needed reforms.  The Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act cuts redtape so veterans can access care more quickly. In fact, I made it clear from the get-go that I would not vote to extend the Choice Program until Congress and the VA have addressed some of the biggest concerns I have been hearing from Montana veterans and community providers.  Once we get the bill passed, this program reimburses community providers more quickly for the care they provide to our veterans. It reduces out-of-pocket costs for veterans receiving care through the Choice It improves the sharing of medical records between the VA and the community providers to better ensure seamless care for veterans, whether they are seeing a VA doctor or a doctor in their community. It allows the VA to access all the funding initially appropriated for this program to ensure that veterans' access to care is not disrupted.  This bill is not going to fix everything, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. With this legislation, combined with assurances that I have received from VA Montana, VA folks within the State will be allowed to schedule appointments for Montana's veterans directly instead of going through an inept government contract.  It is my hope that we can make the Choice Program work the way it was[[Page S2142]]intended when we first set it up, with the goal of serving those who have served our country.

I just want to go back and say one thing.  We are going to have a unanimous consent. I am told there will be an objection to it. That is truly unfortunate because this has been a bipartisan effort. It has cleared everyone in the Senate except one person, to my knowledge, and I think that is unfortunate.  One of the complaints I hear is that the primary payer provision of this bill is the problem. The primary payer provision of this bill requires the VA to be exactly that--the primary payer of the bills. My question would be, Why is this a bad thing? Right now veterans are being hamstrung and delayed, and the folks who provide the benefits, the providers, are not getting the dollars in a timely manner. I would just ask, if the VA is not going to be the primary payer, who is?  These folks have put it on the line for this country, and they come back in different shape than when they left, after they bore the battles of war. Some of the injuries are seen; some of the injuries are unseen. And we are not going to say ``You know what. Don't worry about it. We are going to make sure you get the care, and we are going to make sure it is paid for''? It is part of the cost of war. So when we send our young men and women off to war, we ought to be thinking about this stuff. And we have a solution. We have a solution to part of the problems with the Choice  If we get this bill passed, it will give us the opportunity to work together to get a long-term bill passed before the first of the year to really address the needs of our veterans so that there are wraparound services at the VA that veterans can count on.  I would just say that this is supposed to be a very deliberative body, and for the most part, it is pretty deliberative. But when you have a situation of a program that we put into effect--that Congress passed and the Senate had a big part of writing--and it is not working, we ought to fix it, and this bill fixes it in good part. We have some more to do, as I said, but this bill is a step in the right direction in cutting redtape and making it easier for veterans to find care and get care, whether it is in the VA or outside the It[[Page S2143]]is also something that the Veterans Administration sorely needs to move it forward.  I just want to say that we come in here and we have good arguments and good discussions, and sometimes politics comes into the discussion. In this particular case, folks have come to the table--whether it is Senator Isakson or Senator McCain or Senator Moran or me or any of the others on the Veterans' Affairs Committee--and we have come up with a solution that 99 percent of the people in this body agree with, but we can't get it across the finish line. And we wonder why our popularity is in the single digits in this country.  I am just going to close by saying I want to thank everybody from both sides of the aisle who worked together to get this bill crafted and get this bill to this point. I hope that at some point in time, people will take a look at this bill for what it does and realize that there aren't bogeymen in this bill, that our veterans deserve us to work together to find solutions to move the ball forward so they can get the healthcare they were promised when they signed on the dotted line to protect this country.

681,topic-id,1746,"Mr.President, last week the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Everything we heard from this nominee confirmed what has been clear from the beginning: Judge Gorsuch is the kind of judge all of us should want on the Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch obviously has a distinguished resume. He graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and went on to receive a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall scholar.  He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices--Byron White and Anthony Kennedy--and he worked in both private practice and at the Justice Department before being nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he has served with distinction for 10 years.  He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist and a gifted writer whose opinions are known for their clarity. Most importantly, however, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper role of a judge, and that role is to interpret the law, not make the law; to judge, not legislate; to call balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of the game.  It is great to have strong opinions. It is great to have sympathy for causes or organizations. It is great to have plans for fixing society's problems, but none of those things has any business influencing your ruling when you sit on the bench. Your job as a judge is to apply[[Page S2028]]the law as it is written--and here is the fundamental thing--even when you disagree with it.  ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge,'' Judge Gorsuch said more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law. That is a problem. Equal justice under the law, equal protection under the law--these principles become meaningless when judges step outside of their role and start changing the meaning of the law to suit their feelings about a case or their personal opinions.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination has attracted support from both sides of the political spectrum. I think the main reason for that is because both liberals and conservatives know they can trust Judge Gorsuch to rule based on the plain text of the law, irrespective of his personal opinions. Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will help      to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the      bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record      that should give the American people confidence that he will      not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed      him.  The Colorado Springs Gazette recently highlighted a letter signed by 96 prominent Colorado lawyers and judges and sent to the senior Senator from Here is what those individuals had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,      Democrats, and Many of us have been critical of      actions taken by President Nonetheless, we all agree      that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join      the Supreme We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of      utmost character. He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a      judge and a person. His record shows that he believes      strongly in the independence of the judiciary.  A former law partner and friend of Judge Gorsuch--a friend who describes himself as ``a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes''--had this to say about the judge:       Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer      and a judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and      legal system. The facts developed in a case matter to him;      the legal rules established by legislatures and through      precedent deserve deep respect; and the importance of      treating litigants, counsel and colleagues with civility is      deeply engrained in him. . . .       I have no doubt that I will disagree with some decisions      that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court Yet, my      hope is to have Justices on the bench such as Gorsuch . . .      who approach cases with fairness and intellectual rigor, and      who care about precedent and the limits of their roles as      judges.  Again, that is from a self-described ``longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes.''  During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch's former clerks, except for two currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a letter on his nomination to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Here is what they had to say:       Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are      united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary      judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted      himself to the rule of law. He believes firmly that the role      of the judge in our democracy is to apply the laws made by      the political branches--that is, to adhere to our      Constitution and statutes our elected representatives have      enacted, and not to confuse those things with a judge's own      policy preferences.       As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that      Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his      personal view of what the law should be. Nor does he ever      bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.       For Judge Gorsuch, a judge's task is not to usurp the      legislature's role; it is to find and apply the law as      written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the      separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to      serve on the nation's highest court.  That is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch's former law clerks, whose political views in their own words ``span the spectrum.'' Unfortunately, no amount of testimony in favor of Judge Gorsuch will ever be enough for some Senate  The Senate minority leader took to the floor last week to announce a determination to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. He also announced his determination to push for a filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The minority leader's reasons? Well, for starters, the minority leader apparently doesn't trust that Judge Gorsuch will use the bench to implement the leader's preferred policies. He disagrees with some of Judge Gorsuch's decisions, and he apparently considers that sufficient grounds to bar Judge Gorsuch from the Supreme The minority leader demonstrated little interest in whether Judge Gorsuch's legal interpretations were correct. For the minority leader, judging is about getting one's preferred outcome, irrespective of what the law actually says.  The minority leader also mentioned another reason for opposing Judge Gorsuch: He doesn't trust the judge to be independent or impartial, even though liberals and conservatives alike have praised Judge Gorsuch's independence and impartiality as two of his defining characteristics.  The minority leader also made the laughable claim that Judge Gorsuch is somehow out of the judicial mainstream. Well, let me quote what the Wall Street Journal said on this subject. In February, the Journal wrote:       Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining      the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. Only 1.75 percent      (14 opinions) [out of 800] drew dissent from his colleagues.      That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a      circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by      Democratic Presidents and five by  Let me repeat that last line: ``That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans.''  Well, I wonder if the minority leader intended to suggest that the entire Tenth Circuit is composed of extremist judges or that all of the judges on the Tenth Circuit lacked impartiality or independence, because, logically speaking, if you are going to suggest that Judge Gorsuch is an extremist, then you would have to argue that his colleagues who agreed with his opinions 98 percent of the time are extremists too.  The truth is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has zero to do with whether Judge Gorsuch meets the qualifications of a Supreme Court It is obvious that the judge has all the qualifications one could want in a Democrats are opposing Judge Gorsuch because they are mad. They are mad that their party didn't win the Presidential election, they are mad that their party doesn't have control of Congress, and they are mad that they are having to consider a judge nominated by a Republican It doesn't matter how qualified Judge Gorsuch is, how impartial he is, how independent he is, some Democrats are just going to oppose him anyway.  This isn't the first time Judge Gorsuch has been before this body. Back in 2006, the Senate considered Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth At that time, the judge's nomination sailed through the Both of his home State Senators--one a Republican and one a Democrat--supported his nomination, and he was confirmed by unanimous vote. Then-Senator Obama could have objected to the nomination, but he didn't. The current minority leader, who was serving in the Senate at that time, could have objected to the nomination, but he didn't. Senators Biden or Clinton could have objected to the nomination, but they didn't. Why? Presumably because they saw what almost everybody sees today: that Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of judge we want on the bench--supremely qualified, thoughtful, fair, and impartial. It is incredibly disappointing that some Democrats are now planning to oppose this eminently qualified Supreme Court nominee simply because they can't deal with losing an election.  The Senate has a 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote. There has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in 230 years, and the only ones who have ever attempted one are the Well, some Democrats may follow the minority leader in opposing Judge I am hopeful that others will listen to the many voices, liberal and conservative, speaking out in support of his nomination.[[Page S2029]]  There is no good reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch, and there is every reason to support him.

Instead, this effort would eviscerate any real online privacy protections and would limit data security.

This bill pretends to improve scientific integrity and transparency while, in reality, they would stop the EPA from doing its critical job, its critical mission of protecting the American people.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Consortium for Ocean      Leadership, which represents our nation's leading ocean      research and technology institutions (from academia,      industry, and aquaria), I am writing to express concern      regarding the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment      (HONEST) Act of 2017 (H.1430). Sound science must underpin      the rulemaking process at all our nation's federal agencies,      the Environmental Protection Agency included. I am concerned      about the practical implications of this bill and what it      means, not only for the rulemaking process, but for the      health, security, and prosperity of our nation and its      citizens. While I ardently support efforts to ensure the      continued use of sound science, I urge you and your      colleagues to consider unintended consequences of this bill      before bringing it to the House floor.       While reproducibility is a fundamental assumption of      science, that should not be conflated with the idea that all      non-reproducible science is incorrect. There are many cases      where reproducibility is simply not possible, but that does      not negate the importance of the conclusions that have been      reached. In 1994, the comet Shoemaker-Levy collided with our      celestial neighbor Jupiter, providing a first-hand look at      cosmic collisions and insight on both the comet and the      planet. The devastating Deepwater Horizon disaster in the      Gulf of Mexico has provided untold insights into everything      ranging from ecosystem responses to oil to impacts on      communities' physical and mental health. Because studies      stemming from these one-time incidents are not reproducible,      it does not mean that their methodology and results are      flawed. Additionally, longitudinal studies, especially in the      public health arena, are often too large and take so much      time (e.g., a study following a cohort for multiple decades)      that they could not realistically be reproduced but are      instead replicated through statistical modeling. Under the      current language of the HONEST Act, similar studies within      EPA's purview would be excluded from the agency's use,      potentially keeping the agency from making a proposal or      disseminating information and limiting the amount of good      science from which the EPA can makes decisions.       The bill also requires scientific and technical information      used to make federal regulations be posted online. While the      language specifies that personally identifiable information      used in these studies be redacted (unlike in the bill's      predecessor, the Secret Science Reform Act), the HONEST Act      goes on to state that personal information could be disclosed      to anyone who signs a confidentiality agreement with the      administrator. If federal regulations are made that impact a      specific industry, the same industry could access the      personal records of those who participated in the study.      Knowing that their personal information could be made      accessible to anyone would likely reduce the number of      willing participants in such a study, again limiting the best      science available to the agency.       Additionally, redacting information from documents is a      costly and time-consuming process that often requires the      work of an entire office. The EPA's limited resources, rather      than being spent fulfilling its mission ``to protect human      health and the environment'' would instead be spent      redacting, potentially hundreds of thousands of documents.      Conversely, the bill does not define who would make this      information publicly available online (and make appropriate      redactions) if the EPA were relying on a published, peer-     reviewed study performed by another entity, such as an      academic research institution. This would potentially impose      unexpected costs on the institution.       Rather than improving the quality of science used by the      agency, this bill would instead limit the amount of ``best      available science'' available for decision-making and would      require significant time and manpower. Such an impact would      threaten the health, not only of our nation, but of our      country's citizens who rely on the EPA to protect their well-     being. The unintended consequences from this bill are myriad,      and the ocean science and technology community stands ready      to help you evaluate them before considering this legislation      on the House floor.           Respectfully,     Jonathan White, RADM (Ret.), USN,       President and CEO, Consortium for Ocean                                  ____                                                Environmental Data                                      & Governance Initiative,                                                   March 27, 2017.       Dear Representative: The Environmental Data & Governance      Initiative (EDGI) has analyzed the potential effects of the      Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (H.     1430) and determined that the bill would obstruct the EPA's      use of scientific studies in essential agency work. EDGI is      an organization comprised of non-profit employees and      academics that promotes open and accessible government data      and information along with evidence-based policy making. As      researchers invested in robust environmental data governance,      EDGI members are concerned that this legislation would force      the EPA to make determinations without certain categories of      crucial evidence-based research it needs to make the best      decisions for the health and welfare of the public and the      environment.       H.1430 is just the latest iteration of the proposed      Secret Science Reform Acts of 2014 and 2015. These bills      would have prevented the EPA from relying on a large number      of validated and pivotal scientific studies in its decision-     making processes. Similarly, in its words, H.1430 would      ``prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from      proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or      assessments based upon science that is not transparent or      reproducible.'' Proponents claim that H.1430 would improve      transparency in scientific decision-making and public data      accessibility, efforts that EDGI supports. However, as EDGI's      analysis shows, H.1430 instead places important validated      science off limits to the       The data access requirements in H.1430 would obstruct      public protections critical to human safety and health. Any      studies that utilize confidential medical records--including      many human health studies--would be nearly impossible for the      EPA to use because personally identifiable medical data      cannot be released to the general public. For instance, the      EPA would not be able to use epidemiological studies that are      critical for linking exposure to toxics with certain types of      diseases in the creation of standards that ensure our safe      drinking water and healthy air.[[Page H2543]]       Additionally, the proposed legislation would bar studies      that cannot be reproduced from use by the Blocking the      EPA from using studies that are hard to reproduce impedes the      EPA's ability to protect the public from future health      hazards. Some of the nation's best evidence of public health      risks comes from long-term analyses, assessments of chronic      effects of exposure to toxic substances, studies based on      natural and human-caused catastrophes, and other studies that      we cannot reproduce.       Specific examples of current protections and programs that      would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the EPA to      issue had H.1430 been in place include:       Standards that protect children from lead-based paint      hazards in their homes and schools. The EPA creates standards      that protect children from the adverse neurological effects      of exposure to lead in paint, dust, and soil. The agency      bases these lead protections on long-term studies of children      who have suffered lead exposure in the past. Because EPA      regulations have effectively reduced lead exposure in      children, reproducing these long-term epidemiological studies      would be nearly impossible, as the cohort of study subjects      no longer exists. Prohibiting the EPA from using historical      reports like these would make continuing regulation of lead      much harder.       Safeguards that protect people from exposure to radioactive      contaminants in drinking water. The EPA's standards for the      permissible quantity of certain radionuclides, such as      uranium, found in drinking water are based on data from      radiation exposure studies that use confidential patient      information from a cohort of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic      bomb survivors, which could not be used under this bill.      Long-term epidemiological studies conducted on this cohort      are also unreproducible, rendering these studies, and others      like them, nearly impossible for the EPA to use under H.     1430's provisions.       Measures that improve safety at industrial facilities and      protect and assist first responders and emergency authorities      during accidents. The EPA improved its risk management      regulations following several catastrophic events involving      chemical plants, including an explosion at the West      Fertilizer Company facility in Texas that killed 14 people,      ten of them first responders. The studies that result from      chemical explosions like these cannot be reproduced and would      not be available for the EPA's use under H.1430,      preventing the agency from properly protecting first      responders and the public from future chemical disasters.       Plans that ensure best practices in cleaning up major oil      spills and other hazardous waste spills that affect wildlife      health and habitats. After the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran      aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989,      the EPA developed a restoration program to clean up the 11      million gallons of oil that had spilled into the Sound and      affected over 1,000 miles of shoreline. This cleanup program      would have been impossible without field studies of Prince      William Sound and other historical oil spills. Given the      large scale of these catastrophic spills, these studies      cannot be reproduced and thus would be barred from use by the      EPA by H.1430.       The EPA would be hampered from implementing these vital      protections and programs under H.1430. While the bill      contains a provision that pretends to skirt some of these      legal obstacles by only divulging protected materials to      people who sign confidentiality agreements, this provision is      illusory because medical data, trade secrets, and other      privacy-protected data cannot be released to the general      public, regardless of whether they sign a confidentiality      agreement. The EPA cannot issue confidentiality agreements on      behalf of third party researchers, so H.1430 would inhibit      the EPA's ability to use many important scientific studies      despite this confidentiality agreement provision.       Further, H.1430 limits the EPA to spending only $1      million a year to comply with these new requirements, yet the      CBO estimated that past versions of this legislation would      have cost the EPA up to $250 million annually to implement      the data access provisions required in the bill. The added      obligations specified in this legislation, coupled with a      lack of adequate funding to implement the law, would prevent      the EPA from fulfilling its hazard prevention and      environmental safety protection responsibilities.       Agencies tasked with protecting human health must be able      to rely on all available scientific data. Currently, the EPA      goes to great lengths to ensure that all of the data it      relies on is thoroughly reviewed and accessible. The EPA uses      several processes to ensure quality and relevance of data,      such as internal and external peer review and review by      scientific advisory boards.       When the EPA is prohibited from utilizing the most optimal      data, it puts the health and safety of citizens at risk.      Protecting safe drinking water and healthy air depends on the      EPA's ability to incorporate the best available evidence from      all scientific fields of study into its risk assessments and      regulation drafting processes. EDGI's analysis and research      shows that the passage of H.1430 would block the EPA from      using the data it needs to fulfill its mission of protecting      public health and the environment.

We must protect the scientific process from political interference, which is why I recently introduced the Scientific Integrity Act, which will require our United States Federal agencies to adopt or strengthen policies to insulate government-directed research from the influence of political pressure and special interests.  Under the Scientific Integrity Act, Federal agencies that conduct or fund scientific research would be required to develop clear, written scientific integrity policies that can guarantee research is being done and published without undue influence, censorship, or distortion.  Scientific and technological information would be able to flow more easily while protecting privacy, confidentiality, and our national security. Twenty-four separate Federal agencies have developed scientific integrity policies to date. This legislation would also codify and strengthen these policies within a common framework.

957,topic-id,3316,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in strong support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch as Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  There has been a lot of debate about Judge Gorsuch and his candidacy for the Supreme Let me first review some of the things that really have not been debated. One is the intellect and the education and the knowledge of this man. It is really extraordinary.  Judge Gorsuch attended Columbia University as an undergrad, Harvard Law School, and he went on to Oxford for postgraduate work.  Nobody disputes the intellect, the education, and the knowledge that this man brings to this job. Nobody disputes his experience and qualifications, either. How could they? He has spent 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest level of courts in our American system. There is no question that Neil Gorsuch has the experience and the qualifications.  Character and temperament are extremely important--actually, essential--characteristics for a judge or a I have heard nobody criticize the character or temperament of Judge Gorsuch, whatsoever. In fact, he has only gotten glowing praise about both his integrity, his character, his temperament, and the way he treats people in his courtroom and throughout his life.  There is also no disputing that he has enjoyed very broad bipartisan support in the past and significantly to this day. First of all, there was not a single Senator who opposed his confirmation to the Tenth Circuit when he was nominated and confirmed.  President Barack Obama's Acting Solicitor General, a Democrat, has endorsed Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme A bipartisan group of attorneys, former colleagues from his law firm, classmates of his, and many people across the political spectrum from both parties who know this man personally have strongly endorsed his candidacy.  So as to these very important criteria--his intellect, his education, his knowledge, his experience, his temperament, his character--everything about this man is really quite extraordinary, and that is not even disputed. That is almost universally acknowledged.  So what is the attack? What is the criticism that we hear about Judge Gorsuch? Well, one is this notion that somehow he is outside the mainstream. We have heard this from some of our colleagues who intend not to support Judge  One of the things about being a circuit court judge is that it is actually quite easy to evaluate whether or not a circuit court judge is outside the mainstream because, as it happens, appellate court or circuit court judges don't rule alone. They rule in groups. It is usually a group of three when they are hearing a case as a subset of the full court, or it is the entire court. Either way, they are ruling with other judges.  So you can evaluate, for instance, how often they are by themselves, how often they are the sole minority dissenting view, because that might be an indication of someone who is outside the mainstream.  It is interesting. In the over 2,700 cases that Neil Gorsuch has decided on, in 99 percent of those cases, he was in the majority. In 97 percent of the cases, it was unanimous. How could that possibly be outside of the mainstream? That is not a valid argument at all.  As to the people who are trying to manufacture some opposition to Judge Gorsuch, what they are doing is they are cherry-picking a handful of the over 2,700 cases in which he has participated in, and they try to find a handful in which Judge Gorsuch did not rule in favor of litigants that our Democratic colleagues believe are politically sympathetic. That is what their argument has come down to.  The Democratic minority leader has been down on the floor for a speech, and I will quote from his speech. He said: ``I saw a judge who repeatedly decided with insurance companies that[[Page S2087]]wanted to deny disability benefits to employees.''  The Democratic leader goes on to say: ``I saw a judge who, in unemployment discrimination, sided with employers the great majority of the time.''  Here is another quote: ``Time and time again, his rulings favor the already powerful over ordinary Americans.''  The Democratic leader went on to marvel: ``Judge Gorsuch ruled against a teacher.'' ``Judge Gorsuch ruled against a truck driver.''  Now, even if you set aside the fact that the facts in these cases have been wildly distorted in the retelling that I have heard, and if you set aside the fact that even in those very cases in which Judge Gorsuch has ruled, often he has ruled with the Democratic judges who enjoy the support of our Democratic colleagues, and even if you ignore the fact that in many of these cases he was bound by precedent--he had no choice--you could also ignore all the many other cases in which Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of workers and unions and people who allege sexual harassment, environmentalists, immigrants, and other sympathetic litigants. The minority leader put all that aside. I think we have to ask a fundamental question: What is missing in this critique of Judge Gorsuch's decisions? What I find striking is that what is missing is any reference to the law. I don't hear them mention the law. I have not heard any of our Democratic colleagues, who intend to oppose Judge Gorsuch, say that he ignored the law or that he violated the law or that he misapplied the law or that he misunderstood the law. I don't hear anything of the sort.  Now, why do you suppose that is? I think I know why that is. I think because to many of the people who are threatening to oppose Neil Gorsuch, the law isn't what really matters the most. What really matters the most is that politically favored special interests or someone that they think the public will be sympathetic to has to win regardless of the law. They want a policy outcome and one that would benefit their perceived preferred litigants, rather than the law.  Here is what I think. I really think there are two unpardonable offenses in the minds of our friends and colleagues who are opposing Neil Gorsuch's nomination. The first is that Judge Gorsuch believes in the rule of law. I know he does. It is very, very clear. To some degree, there is a fundamental debate going on here between those who support his candidacy and those who oppose it, and it is fundamentally about the role of judges in the U.constitutional system.  One view, the view that I have--and I believe the one that Judge Gorsuch shares--is that the law totally matters. What the law says matters, and that includes the The words matter. And not only that, but it is up to the American people to change laws or to change the Constitution, if the American people see fit. It is up to judges to impartially apply the law and the Constitution, as it is written, and that is an important thing here. Both of these are important.  Under our view of the world, a judge is supposed to see everyone the same regardless of race, sex, wealth, political affiliation, or other characteristics. A judge is obligated to neutrally apply the law. Whether you are a man or a woman, young or old, rich or poor, Black or White, that is not supposed to matter to a judge. There is a reason our symbol of justice, Lady Justice, is depicted wearing a blindfold--it is because as a judge you are not supposed to decide based on these characteristics of a person; you are supposed to decide based on what the law says. This is fundamental to an independent judiciary, to a nation that lives by the rule of law.  But the other view, the critics' view--they constantly go back not to the law or the application of the law but to how sympathetic the litigants are. That is what matters most to them. That is an implicit rejection of the notion that everyone is equal before the law. Instead, in that world view, some are more equal than others and the law means whatever a judge thinks it should mean, and that is based significantly on whom the litigants are.  The same applies to the Constitution, in their world view, that of those who are opposing Judge The Constitution can't really mean exactly what it says--that can be very inconvenient--and so what the Supreme Court is supposed to be, in the minds of our friends who are opposing Judge Gorsuch, the Supreme Court is really a permanently sitting constitutional convention. Make up the Constitution as it goes along. Decide what it means today as opposed to what it meant yesterday or what it might mean tomorrow. The judges are supposed to be acutely sensitive to the race, wealth, political affiliation of the people who come before them, and those criteria matter a great deal.  In fact, you have to ask yourself, if that is the way you view the world, why even bother having a trial? Why not have a checklist and see whether the litigants come down on the politically sympathetic side of the ledger, and once you know that, you can decide? Why bother with the hassles or a trial or a case?  I would suggest that this approach to the law--the law that depends on the race, ethnicity, or any other criteria of the litigants--such a law is not a law at all. That is how a banana republic imposes the law; that is not how America views the law.  So my view, as I stated earlier, that the law means exactly what it says and nothing other than what it says--and that also applies to the Constitution--that is a view which is often described as originalism. The opponents' view, especially with respect to the Constitution--they believe the Constitution is a living document, meaning changes over time, in their view. I would suggest that this is the fundamental choice between the rule of law in the former case and the rule by judges in the latter case.  Justice Scalia once said: ``Every tin horn dictator in the world today, every president for life, has a Bill of Rights.'' The Bill of Rights only protects us if it is enforced and if it is enforced consistently and equally for everyone who is involved. How much protection does our Bill of Rights provide if, as Chief Justice Hughes stated in 1907, ``the Constitution is what the judges say it is''? Well, as Justice Scalia observed, once the original meaning of the Constitution can be set aside and judges can rewrite it, then they can rewrite and limit individual liberty or any other of the rights that are so fundamental to the nature of our country.  Let me give an example that makes this very specific. There is a case that came before the Supreme Court not very long ago called the Kelo decision. The Fifth Amendment states very clearly that the government cannot take private property unless it is ``for public use.'' That is what it says in the Look it up. Well, in the Kelo case, five Supreme Court Justices decided that public use can mean private use. The word ``public'' can mean ``private.'' Specifically in this case, what they said was that the government can come along and take an individual's home and give it to a private company--in this case, to use as a parking lot for a private venture. This is blatantly unconstitutional. It is very, very clear. Yet that is what happened when five Justices decided they could just rewrite the Constitution as they prefer it.  Here is the thing about this: Even if you believe it is a good idea to be able to take someone's house and give it to another private developer because he has a better use for it than the homeowner, if you think that is a good idea--I don't happen to think that is a good idea, but you might. If you do, we have a mechanism for making that policy permissible. You change the You amend the You can strike that word or insert another clause. There are any number of ways you can change that.  But here is what is so important: Under our constitutional system, the only people who get to change the Constitution are the American people. They do it through their elected representatives in the Congress and in the State legislatures, but they are the sovereigns. It is the American people who get to make these decisions, who determine policy, not five unelected guys wearing black robes, because when they get to make that policy, they are not accountable to anyone. They can't be fired. The Presiding Officer and I can be fired. If we are not[[Page S2088]]doing the job our constituents want us to do, we will be fired. That is how we are held accountable. Our constituents can replace us with people who will reflect the policies they want. That is why we are the policymakers under our constitutional system.  I believe Neil Gorsuch completely understands this. It is one of the reasons our friends on the other side of the aisle can't bring themselves to support him.  I think there were two unpardonable sins that Neil Gorsuch has committed. I just mentioned the first. I think the second one was that he was nominated by Donald We have folks in this Chamber who don't seem to be able to accept that they lost an election, and they are reflexively opposing whatever it is President Trump wants, and apparently they intend for that opposition to continue indefinitely.  In a public interview, the minority leader was quoted as saying: ``It is hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support.''  He was asked a follow-up question: ``So will you do your best to hold the seat open?''  The Democratic minority leader replied: ``Absolutely.''  Hold the seat open for 4 years or maybe 8 years? This is outrageous, and it is unprecedented.  If the minority leader were to get his way, for the first time in the history of the Republic, we would have a Supreme Court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster. Let me stress this. This has never happened before in the history of the country. How many times have we nominated and confirmed Supreme Court Justices? Never once have we had a partisan filibuster used to block the consideration of a nominee. We have had people withdraw. We have had people who were voted down.  The case of Abe Fortas was an unusual case where there was a bipartisan filibuster because there was a perception of ethics problems, and he, in fact, had to resign as an Associate The bipartisan filibuster was used when there was an attempt by President Johnson to elevate him to Chief That is not the precedent. There is no precedent.  Take the case of Clarence In my lifetime, I am pretty sure Clarence Thomas was the most controversial nominee we have ever had. It was a brutal, very difficult, very contentious, really ugly process--the hearings, the nomination process, the confirmation process. In the end, Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52 votes. Any Senator in the body could have insisted on a 60-vote threshold if it was there, but nobody did. No Senator did because the custom has been that Supreme Court Justices get confirmed if they have a majority of support. So what the minority leader wants to do is completely departing from that and establishing a new threshold.  The minority leader made an argument that is absolutely laughable. He suggested that because President Obama's nominees got 60 votes, well, then President Trump's should. What is laughable about that is the reason President Obama's nominees got 60 votes is because Republicans gave them those votes. I was running for the Senate at the time that Sonia Sotomayor was nominated, and I pointed out that there was a lot I disagreed about with her. I am sure I will not be happy with many of her decisions. But here we are in the President's new term--relatively early--and this is a qualified, capable person. I am not going to obstruct. I voted to confirm her, and a number of Republicans did join the Democrats, and President Obama got Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan confirmed to the bench.  The minority leader has suggested that there is this tradition of 60 votes. Well, you don't have to take my word for it; the Washington Post Fact Checker--not exactly the mouthpiece of the Republican Party--did their fact-checking analysis, and they said it was absolutely false. They gave him three  It is also one of the many ironies of this that the very same Democrats who insist that we should allow them to permanently block any Supreme Court nominee because they won't provide the votes to get to 60 are the ones who actually did break the Senate tradition and establish a 50-vote threshold when they wanted to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals back in 2013. Now they suggest that if we use the same tactic they used--although we are doing it for a different reason--that this would be an abomination, that the Democrats would never do this. Well, actually, they did in 2013. But as for the circumstances we face now, there is no mystery about what they would have done because they told us just 12 days before the election.  Our Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for Vice President, was asked: ``What happens if,'' as everyone expected at the time, ``Hillary Clinton becomes President and the Democrats take control of the Senate, if Republicans were to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee? What would you do?''  I will quote Senator He said: ``We will change the Senate rules to uphold the law, that the court will be nine members.''  Here is the truth: If the election had gone differently, if Hillary Clinton had won and if Democrats were in control of the Senate, then Republicans would have probably provided the votes for a competent, capable, qualified Supreme Court nominee, just as Republicans did for Elena Kagan and Sonia That is what history has shown. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues at this point seem unwilling--or at least some of them are--to provide the same bipartisan cooperation to a new President attempting to fill a vacancy that Republicans provided to President  Let me conclude with this: The case for confirming Judge Gorsuch was summed up pretty well by the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune--again, not exactly the RNC's mouthpiece--in endorsing Neil They said:       Here is a judge who knows the law and knows the role of the      judiciary: He isn't on the bench to make law, he's there to      interpret it faithfully, because the separation of powers      among the branches of government serves our democracy.      Sometimes the result benefits liberal positions, sometimes      conservative. . . . Some of Gorsuch's critics think judges      should be creative and expansive depending on the political      climate--to treat laws differently on a cold night than a      warm one. Those critics suggest that they fear Gorsuch won't      follow the law, but the opposite is more true: They fear he      will. Gorsuch should be confirmed.  If our Democratic colleagues aren't willing to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, then there is no one they are going to vote to confirm to the Supreme And we cannot allow a Democratic minority to block an up-or-down vote and deny filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court for 4 or 8 years. We simply can't allow that to happen, and I trust that we won't.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

In many cases, treatment and strong guidance is a better course of action to remedy misdemeanor Federal offenses than jail time, which can lead to a cascade of negative unintended consequences, such as difficulty in obtaining employment.  Thanks to Judge Newman's efforts to cooperate with the United States Attorney's Office and the Federal Public Defender's Office, veterans in the Dayton, Ohio, area can receive treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues, which so often underpin these minor offenses, rather than sitting in jail.  Veterans who decide to participate in Judge Newman's 6-month-long pilot program are required to work closely with a Veterans Justice Outreach coordinator, who acts as a mentor and caseworker, providing guidance, facilitating treatment, and helping secure housing and employment.  Besides meeting with their veterans officer, veterans must also attend medical appointments, receive recommended treatment, and not reoffend in order to graduate. Upon successful completion, the misdemeanor charges are frequently dismissed, allowing former servicemembers to truly earn themselves a second chance at life.  Of the more than 33 veteran participants thus far, 20 have successfully completed the program, and several others are continuing to make progress as we speak.  I commend Judge Newman for instituting an innovative Federal veterans court program that addresses critical needs within our community and resolves programs by rehabilitating rather than simply punishing the brave men and women who have served our country.  I also would like to congratulate Judge Newman for his work in implementing a civics program for students to learn about the Federal courts. Developing a partnership between the Federal judiciary and the Federal Bar Association, these interactive court camps invite elementary, middle, and high school students into the Federal courts to learn about the third branch of government.  During court camp, Federal judges meet with the groups of students in school classrooms, as well as Federal courtrooms, to teach them about the[[Page H2525]]selection process for Federal judges, explain how decisions are made in both criminal and civil cases, and offer an insider's view on how the Federal court system works.  Under Judge Newman's leadership, the Federal Bar Association's partnership with the United States Courts will give thousands of young people across the country the opportunity to meet with Federal judges and explore the judicial branch of government.  In Dayton, Ohio, alone, where Judge Newman sits, over 1,000 students will participate in the civics program, learning more about the Constitution and Bill of Rights, the separation of powers, the role of the Federal judge, the structure of the Federal court system, and how to become a judge or lawyer themselves.  The Federal Bar Association has also added a civics page to its website to make educational materials available for lawyers and judges who choose to serve as mentors in the program.  In an effort to encourage direct involvement by American government teachers and students alike, the Federal Bar Association, again under Judge Newman's leadership, is holding a national essay contest for middle and high school students on the subject ``What Does an Impartial Judicial System Mean to Me?''  In addition to honoring the student essay winners, the Federal Bar Association and United States Courts will also recognize a select group of top-notch civics teachers from across the United  As president of the Federal Bar Association and a United States magistrate, Judge Newman has spearheaded this effort, publicly urging the association's 19,000 members to join him in engaging the next generation of attorneys, judges, and legislators.  I commend Judge Newman on his tireless work to connect our young people to the best and brightest in the field of law, and for reemphasizing the critical importance of civics in American society.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2524.txt,1741,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,29.0,March

1220,topic-id,1675,"Mr.President, I know several Members are ready to come here and talk on a veterans issue, and they will let me know when they are ready to start. I thought there might be a good chance to get this in.  Our democracy is under attack. U.intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian Government interfered in the U.Presidential election and intervened to help Candidate Around the same time, Candidate Trump began making flattering statements about Russian President Putin and proposing pro-Russia policy changes while criticizing longstanding U.allies, including in  President Trump continues to defend Putin and offend Western allies. Now we have come to learn that there are unexplained ties between the President, his campaign staff, his associates, and Russia; that many close to the President had meetings and telephone calls with Russian officials during the campaign and the transition; most critically, that the FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating whether the President and his associates coordinated or conspired with the Russian Government to interfere with the Presidential election--an investigation that began last July and is likely to continue for months.  The President and his associates keep giving the American people reason for worry--inaccurate denials, evasive answers, explosive attacks they can't back up, scheming with the chair of the House Intelligence Committee on the committee's investigation of the White New, very disturbing information comes to light every day.  A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll showed that two thirds of Americans believe a special prosecutor should be appointed. The American people want answers. What was the scope of the interference? Who knew what, and when? How can we protect ourselves and our allies, who are facing similar cyber attacks? What is the appropriate government response to such an attack?  I appreciate the work the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing. I believe that is the first step, but I believe we must go further. That is why I am again calling for an independent, bipartisan national commission modeled on the 9/11 Commission to fully investigate Russia's interference with our election and our election processes and to investigate the ties between the President, his family businesses, and his close associates and Russia that may threaten our national security. I am also again calling on the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel to investigate potential criminal conduct that may jeopardize our security.  Questions about the President's ties to Russia will divide the country, undermine his Presidency, and distract Congress, unless we take these steps. The American people are right to be concerned. The President's stance on Russia is perplexing, starting when he first denounced the role of NATO last spring, calling it ``obsolete,'' suggesting that it would be OK if NATO broke up. Then, he publicly asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails.  Then, Mr.Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was forced to resign because of his close political and financial ties to Ukraine's former pro-Russian He became the subject of a multi-agency investigation. We don't have the full story, but we do know that he failed to register as a foreign agent while he lobbied for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests in the United It appears that Manafort has a $10 million contract with a Russian oligarch who is very close to Putin that would ``greatly benefit the Putin Government'' and that he had at least 15 offshore bank accounts in Cyprus that even Cypriot bank officials thought were suspicious. Once those bank officials began asking about money laundering activities, Manafort closed the accounts rather than answer questions.  During his campaign, Mr.Trump stated that he would ``be looking at'' whether to recognize Crimea as Russian and to lift sanctions. President Trump and his team apparently took little or no interest in the debate over the party platform in the Republican National Convention, except for one thing--They intervened with delegates to get more Russia-friendly language in the Republican Party platform. Candidate Trump's national security policy staffer J.Gordon told CNN: ``This was the language Donald Trump himself wanted . . . and advocated for . . . back in March.'' Now Gordon is reportedly under investigation for his ties to  We have all heard the President compliment President Putin, calling him a strong leader. Why is the President so enamored, when Putin's actions are authoritarian, violent, and anti-democratic? Putin seeks to weaken NATO and the European He annexed Crimea in violation of international law and treaties. He interfered with our national election. Putin has crushed free press in the Russian Federation, placing restriction upon restriction on the press, quashing independent news organizations, and harassing and jailing journalists. The President's outspoken admiration is inexplicable.  So we are still left with a President who has expressed policy views toward Russia that run counter to U.ideals and treaty obligations, as well as global norms of international affairs. While we don't know the full extent of the President's financial, personal, and political ties to Russia and Putin, we have plenty of reason to seek an impartial investigation. The President still has not released his tax returns, unlike any previous modern His son Donald Junior volunteered, as far as[[Page S2141]]back as 2008, that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. . . . We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.''  In 2013, Mr.Trump said on a talk show: ``Well, I've done a lot of business with the Russians.''  Due to his history of bankruptcies, no major U.bank would loan to Donald Trump in recent years. So he has needed new sources of capital for his real estate projects. There is growing reason to believe that Russia--or at least wealthy Russians--have financial interests in the Trump organization. Recent reports link the President and his companies to ten wealthy former Soviet businessmen with alleged ties to criminal organizations or money laundering. The extent of corruption and criminal ties among the oligarchs of Russia are well known, and to stay wealthy oligarchs, they must stay friendly with the Putin regime.  Is the Trump organization reliant on Russian capital or loans from Russian banks? What relationships are there between Russian oligarchs that are tied to the Russian Government and the Trump organization and between those former Soviet businessmen and Trump's properties? We need to get to the bottom of this, with a credible, deliberate, nonpartisan investigation.  Mr.Trump has surrounded himself with associates with close Russian ties--not just Mr.Michael Flynn headed to Russia within 18 months after his retirement as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian Government's media outlet Secretary John Kerry called RT a ``propaganda bullhorn'' for Mr.Flynn was paid for that trip by RT, a potential violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, and appeared regularly on Flynn, of course, had to resign as National Security Advisor after 24 days in office. But the President knew of Flynn's misrepresentations weeks before he was fired and did nothing until it became public. We now know that Russia's payments to Flynn were generous. In 2015, Russian entities paid him $65,000. We know he worked for pay as a foreign agent for Turkey during the campaign and during the transition, but he failed to register as an agent at the time, as required by law.  Other Trump associates and campaign staff--Roger Stone, Carter Page, and Mr.Gordon--all are reportedly under investigation for intercepted communications and financial transactions with Stone admitted at least 16 contacts with Gufficer 2.0, the Twitter handle covering for Russian intelligence that released the Democratic National Committee hacked emails.  Page, who has strong financial ties with Russia, admitted to meeting with the Russian Ambassador during the Republican Convention and traveling to Russia during the campaign.  The President's Attorney General was forced to recuse himself from any Department of Justice investigation into Trump and Russia because he did not disclose to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he met with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign.  Now the President's son-in-law and senior adviser is set to testify before the Senate's Intelligence He will talk about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, a close Putin ally who is head of a Russian-owned bank.  Where does it stop, folks? Where does it stop?  These contacts give us enough reason for pause. Combined with Mr.Trump's positions on NATO, sanctions relief, and Russia's human rights violations, they raise serious security questions for the United States and As I said, we need an independent prosecutor at the helm to ensure that the whole of the investigation is not compromised--one who is not subject to White House pressure and not in a position of investigating his or her boss--and a bipartisan commission along the lines of the 9/11 Commission that is independent of politics.  The chair of the House Intelligence Committee is compromised and damaged beyond repair. He has coordinated with the subjects of his committee's investigation, and he has completely lost credibility. I compliment my Senate colleagues who are working together on an investigation. But the Senate committee does not have the resources to fully investigate this, and the ranking Democrat on the committee agrees we need an independent investigation that could go further, that could be public, and could be transparent.  A former Acting Director of the CIA called the Russian interference in our election one of the most successful covert operations in history. Former Vice President Cheney has said that what they did could be ``considered an act of war.'' By covert interference in a U.election, Russia pursued a policy to install its favorite candidate as President of the United Yet the President has dismissed the National Security Agency findings, accused our national security agencies of acting like Nazi Germany, and leveled fake charges at the former  The American people are not fooled, and they want Congress to get to the bottom of this.

115,topic-id,388,"Mr.Speaker, you know, there is an old Upton family quote that my grandfather would always say: Was you always perfect? No, none of us are.  And you know what? This is not a perfect bill. That is for sure. But ObamaCare is broken. One out of three counties has only one provider, and it looks like it is going to get worse as other major insurance companies are on the verge of pulling the plug.  Nearly two dozen of the nonprofit CO-OPS have already gone belly up. In my home State, folks saw their premiums increase by nearly 17 percent. Some States have had premium increases of more than 100 percent. Most had double-digit increases, many over 20 percent, and some forecast 40 to 50 percent increases come fall if nothing happens.  The calls on both sides of the aisle have often used the R word--on this side, ``replace''; on your side, the Democratic side, ``repair.'' Let's both agree. The status quo is not acceptable. But this, this bill, is the only train leaving the station. Is it going to improve if it gets to the Senate? Of course it will. We should all work for that goal.  For me, I worked with Medicaid expansion States like Michigan providing a reasonable transition until 2020 and then grandfathering all those folks until they are off.

Total repeal would mean taking away the ability of HHS to provide flexibility to the States to administer this critical program. It would mean taking away insurance for young kids on their parents' policies. It would reinstall a cap on insurance. And, yes, it would allow insurance companies to discriminate against those with preexisting illnesses.  This bill still allows all of those important protections to stay in place. A number of us will continue to work with HHS to provide even more flexibility to States like This has to be a key component of moving forward.

326,topic-id,778,"Mr.Speaker, today's Special Order is going to be about the theme: What do we have to lose?  That was something that you heard during the Presidential campaign. Specifically, we want to focus on what do we have to lose: $54 billion in domestic spending.  Earlier this month, President Trump released his budget named America First, a Budget Blueprint to Make America Great After reading Trump's budget, I can't help but wonder: Is this truly a mirror of his campaign to put Americans first?  The easy answer to that is ``no.''  According to the Trump budget, America comes dead last. In fact, this budget proposal is all talk when it comes to helping U.students access education and well-paying jobs. One of the most alarming things about the budget is how it affects the education of students at minority-serving institutions.  Mr.Speaker, HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, were first created in 1964 to educate Black Americans excluded from segregated public and private universities, and this budget will perpetuate the inequalities that currently exist for Black students.  Today, HBCUs continue to provide students--no matter their race or their economic background for that matter--the ability to receive a quality education. According to the United Negro College Fund, 70 percent of all HBCU students rely on Federal grants and workstudy programs to finance their education.  After Trump pledged to support and strengthen HBCUs during a meeting with the presidents of HBCUs in the Oval Office, the budget at hand is another unfulfilled promise. A recent letter from the president of the UNCF, United Negro College Fund, explained the complete elimination of the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, as proposed under the Trump budget. This would negatively impact more than 55,000 HBCU students.  Helping low-income students achieve higher education is very serious, and we know that these cuts would hurt. Proposed reductions would also hurt the Federal workstudy initiatives, and it would eliminate another 26,000 students the ability to pay for college expenses or to improve their employment prospects.  I knew a lot of students who worked under the college workstudy program when I was a student in college, and I can tell you just how critical that program is. For a lot of kids, that is the difference between going to college and not being able to go to college. Having that job on campus allows you to earn money, but stay on campus, affording you more time to be able to study and do other things that you need to do in order to be a successful student.  Also, according to the Center for American Progress, the Trump budget will hit minority communities the hardest. The budget also calls for $200 million in cuts to Federal TRIO programs, which help low-income, first-generation, and disabled students; and GEAR UP, a program that helps prepare low-income middle and high school students for college.  It shouldn't be any surprise to us that President Trump would want to gut funding to help disabled students succeed. We saw this sort of nastiness on the campaign trail, and we really do need to see how we can, again, boost these programs because they have been helping so many kids for a long time.  I can tell you of someone who utilized a Pell Grant I am sure there are many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that had to use the Pell Grant Similarly, the Trump budget keeps the Pell Grant Program, but it cuts $3.9 billion in critical funding for many students.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Pell Grant Program is the largest Federal grant program. The same study found that the program sends up to $5,900 to students and families that earn less than $40,000 a year and prioritizes funding for families earning closer to $20,000 or less.  Again, if you are a low-income family, being able to utilize that money, particularly at that level--$40,000 and below, $20,000 and below--even if you were doing a little bit better than that, you know that that is not a lot of money, and that is why these Pell Grant Programs are so important.  Pell Grant continues to be an important program that helps level the playing field for African Americans and helps to minimize student loans after graduation.  A study by Brookings reported that Black students who graduated, as of October 2016, owed over $52,000 in student loan debt, compared to White graduates who owed approximately $28,000. By reducing funding, Trump is limiting a child's ability to achieve economic mobility and move toward the American  I am going to ask that my colleague from the great sunshine State of Florida (",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgH2456-5.txt,2166,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,March

That is why in the 111th Congress I was proud to support the Affordable Care As a result of this landmark legislation, 19 million people in the United States now have health insurance coverage who did not before, and over nine-in-ten individuals in my home state of Indiana now have health insurance.  Regretfully, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the legislation we are considering today will leave approximately 14 million more Americans without health care insurance by 2018, and this number will continue to rise to an estimated 24 million by 2026.  I am especially concerned that the American Health Care Act will jeopardize the health care coverage of the over 429,000 Hoosiers currently enrolled in Indiana's expansion of Medicaid, also known as the Healthy Indiana  Further, I believe it is especially disingenuous that if this bill passes today, this institution will have pushed the financial cuts to programs like the Healthy Indiana Plan conveniently until after the next congressional election.  The Act before us also would negatively impact the health of millions of women and men who receive the medical services provided by Planned Additionally, it would not improve the well-being of our nation's elderly by allowing providers to charge older enrollees up to five times as much as younger individuals.  Finally, I would note with great concern that a provision was just added to the American Health Care Act today that would remove the requirement that insurers cover life-saving, essential health benefits, including maternal and pediatric services, rehabilitative therapy, and mental health and substance abuse treatment.  Congress should work to improve the Affordable Care Act and address important health concerns facing ordinary Americans, such as the rising cost of prescription drugs. But today's bill does no such thing.  It is unacceptable and I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

Families and small businesses are paying more for less, and insurers are dropping out of the marketplaces, leaving behind fewer options. Government-run health care isn't working, and we are repealing and replacing ObamaCare like we promised our constituents we would do.  The American Health Care Act is the first step of a three-step process to repair our broken healthcare system. This bill moves power away from Washington and puts doctors and patients at the center of their healthcare decisions. It reforms and strengthens Medicaid and gives States the flexibility to innovate and best meet the needs of their citizens.  This patient-centered approach will bring costs down, increase choice and competition, and provide important protections for patients with preexisting conditions.  Mr.Speaker, these are the types of things we promised, and doing nothing is not an option. May I remind my colleague from the other side of the aisle: I have seen those numbers. My constituents will not simply walk away and do nothing just because the other side says that they will be uncovered. Now they will have a choice. Those thousands of people will not walk away.

I think of the struggles of constituents like Indra from Bend, She lost her private insurance and her preferred doctor. When she went to look for a new plan under ObamaCare, she found the plans were too expensive, and she went without insurance for almost 2 years. See, her story should not be lost in this debate either.                              {time}  1230  Then there is Last fall, she found out her insurer would not be offering her plan this year.

You see, there is a whole other group of Americans out there who are suffering these effects of The American Health Care Act represents a better way for patients like Indra and April all across our country. Our plan will rescue and revitalize the market and lower costs and increase flexibility for patients to choose. They will have more choices for health care and keep a health insurance plan that works for them and for their family.  This legislation creates the Patient and State Stability Now, this is an innovative approach to give States the financing and flexibility to repair the damage done to the insurance markets by ObamaCare and meet the unique needs of their citizens. More importantly, we provide an additional $15 billion, Mr.Speaker, to States devoted for maternity coverage. We heard from people who said we need to do more in this area: newborn care, mental health, and substance disorders.  We are also taking action to strengthen We want to put Medicaid on a sustainable path so it can better care for those it was intended to serve, a path through this per capita program for States that, frankly, was at one time embraced by Democrats, including President  The most vulnerable in our communities need this help. It represents the most substantive reform to the Medicaid program since its creation and will restore power to our States and local communities and governments where they can make better decisions than a one-size-fits-all here in We want to give our States more control in how they manage these people that they are closest to.  In closing, I want to thank our colleagues and the President of the United States and the Vice President and Secretary They have worked day in and day out, tirelessly, without hesitation, to help get to the best policy possible here and to work and listen to our colleagues, as we have all done, to craft the best bill we can, given the constraints under which we must operate.  The end result highlights the diverse ideas of our Conference that come from the American people and the determination that we share to save this market and make it work again.  Remember, we are talking about a narrow slice of the insurance market, that driven by ObamaCare, that, last year, there were 225 counties in America where, if you were looking for insurance on that exchange, you had one option. This year, it is 1,022 counties. That is one out of every three in And that was before Humana pulled out and other companies said this market is about gone.  We need to fix this market. That is what this legislation seeks to do.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank our terrific staff that has worked day and night to get us to this point. We know there is a lot more work to do. This should not be taken in isolation as the only healthcare reform on our list. We are going to go after the cost drivers. We are going to go after prescription costs. We are going to go after hospital costs.  Wherever it is in the health system, if you have nothing to hide, you won't have to fear our investigations. But we are going to get costs down.

174,topic-id,443,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  One of the great tragedies of this debate is some of the scare tactics we have heard. And to listen to the gentleman from California talk about how removing essential benefits from the Federal mandate from the law is going to cause all that to happen is tragic because he, on March 25 of 2015, cosponsored legislation that did precisely that, removed the same Federal mandates for workers in the 51-100 pool of employees for employers. He said it was too much of a mandate then on those businesses, when they provide insurance.  So every Member of the House who was here then, and every Senator, including the Democrat leader of the Senate at the time, voted for that, passed unanimously.  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office said that those regulations that we are pulling back here would have made nongroup premiums 27 percent to 30 percent higher in 2016, than they otherwise would have been. So we are basically taking what CBO said is a good policy and implementing it here once again.  Last time, in 2015, that was bipartisan. It was a voice vote. Today, you would think the world was falling around us, the sky was falling. Yet, everybody who was here in 2015 said, that is okay, it is the right thing to do because it will lower premiums, like CBO said, by 27 to 30 percent.  So we thought what was good for those in the work world, for everybody who is insured through a large group plan, which is about 155 million Americans--they don't live under this mandate, yet they have all those services and benefits--that that would make sense to lower premiums for individuals on the ObamaCare exchange, because what I hear is, premiums are too high, deductibles go up.  Nobody sees this thing coming down. We are making changes here because those exchanges are collapsing. We want to bring the premiums down. We want to make the changes that will bring them down. CBO says doing this on essential benefits would have resulted in nongroup premiums 27 to 30 percent lower than they would have otherwise been. They basically say they would be higher in 2016 than they would have otherwise been. So we are taking that, using that and saying: let's drive them down; let's get premiums down.  It is unfortunate that you were willing to do that 2 years ago. It was bipartisan. Today, it is some extraordinary thing we are doing that is bad. It is not. We want to get lower premiums.

They said: We are going to tell you the kind of insurance you have to buy; we are going to force you to buy it, or you will answer to the IRS and pay a penalty. They mandated that.  Then they came back and said: Well, that didn't work so well, so we had better get rid of the essential benefits for the workers and employers, 51-100 employees in a company; we are going to take that off because that will drive up premiums. And they voted unanimously to do that. Today, they come back and say: Oh, that would be horrible. But they did it before, so they were for it before they were against it.  But let me talk about what really matters here. First of all, there is lot of scare tactics out there by a lot of high-paid organizations.

Those were good things. We agree in a bipartisan way those should be protected. We do that.  But we also recognize that 19.2 million Americans looked at the Democrats' healthcare exchanges and plans, went the other direction, and said no. They have walked with their wallets and their feet and said: I don't like what you are selling and I can't afford what you are selling. I will even pay the IRS $600 or $700 not to take  Meanwhile, Mr.Speaker, the insurers have said that the way the Democrats created the insurance markets all over the country, we can stay in them. We are losing too much money, and we are out.  That is why in one out of three counties today in America you only have one choice, and that is called a monopoly. We are trying to fix this market so people will have choices that are affordable. We are trying to make sure people have access to coverage they want and can afford. This is the first step, not the last step, toward fixing this market.  I look at it like we have poured the foundation. Construction projects are a little messy when you are just pouring the foundation. Now we are going to put up the walls, we are going to put the roof on, and we are going to build this out in multiple steps throughout this year and next.  Meanwhile, we provide complete coverage. We do all the protections ObamaCare continues in its support for people while we fix the market and allow it to come back. We have timed this out. I know there are some on my side of the aisle who wanted to get rid of those protections, and we brought them around or they are going to vote ``no.'' But we said: No; we have to have those protections in place--existing conditions, no more lifetime caps, keeping your kids on until they are 26.  We have a product here that needs to go to the next step. We will all work on it and continue to make it better as we go forward. But if we do nothing and let it fail today, these markets are going to get worse and worse under the Democrats' ObamaCare plans, and people won't have a choice in States and counties all over  I wish we could join together today and put forward a bipartisan vote to save these markets and help our constituents going forward.

As we increasingly rely on technology in nearly every area of our lives, one of Congress' most important responsibilities is to strike the right balance between protecting consumers' privacy while also allowing for private sector innovation and the new jobs and economic growth that accompany it.  The resolution before us today reverses overreaching, shortsighted, and misguided rules adopted by unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications These rules do little to enhance privacy, but clearly add a new layer of Federal red tape on innovators and job creators. This is exactly the type of government overreach that the Congressional Review Act was meant to stop.  The Federal Communications Commission, frankly, overstepped its bounds on many issues during the Obama administration, including privacy regulations. After stripping the Federal Trade Commission of its authority over the privacy practices of internet service providers, ISPs, the FCC adopted shortsighted rules that only apply to one part of the internet. Despite the FTC's proven case-by-case approach to privacy enforcement that, frankly, has protected consumers, while simultaneously allowing ISPs to innovate, the FCC opted to abandon this model in favor of an approach that assumes the Federal Government knows best what consumers want.  Simply put, the rules that the FCC applied to ISPs are illogical. The regulations would require companies to apply the same privacy protections to consumer data, regardless of its importance or sensitivity. It hardly makes sense to treat a local weather update and personal financial information the same way.  In addition, the FCC's approach only protects consumer data as far as the internet service provider is involved. An entirely separate set of rules applies to providers of edge services. That means the giant search corporations, one of which controls up to 65 percent of your searches on the internet, don't live by the same set of privacy rules as your small town  What America needs is one standard, across-the-internet ecosystem, and the Federal Trade Commission is the best place for that standard.  The impact of these rigid regulations has the potential to stifle one of the most innovative sectors of our Nation's economy, and it is consumers who will suffer. These rules, which Congress will repeal, only lead to higher costs, less competition, and fewer service offerings. This approach is particularly burdensome for small businesses, which do not have hallways full of lawyers to navigate these tedious and unnecessary rules.  The benefits of the FCC's privacy regulations are questionable, but the harms are certain, which is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And once these rules are reversed, the FCC can turn back to working together with the FTC to ensure that our privacy framework allows the internet[[Page H2493]]to flourish while truly protecting consumers.

For 7 years, we have seen the same pattern: rising premiums, dwindling options, broken promises, and a collapsing system.  In the State of Indiana, four insurers left the ObamaCare exchange just this year in the past 3 months, forcing 68,000 Hoosiers to shop for a new plan, making it even harder for them to choose and keep their doctor.

391,topic-id,1460,"Mr.President, last week Republicans in Congress came within an inch of ripping health insurance away from 24 million people in order to give tax breaks to rich people. That collapsed, and it collapsed because the American people stood up and said no--no to kicking seniors out of nursing homes, no to booting kids with rare diseases off of their treatments, no to gutting funding for opioid addiction.  All across this country--in every corner of this country--for months people spoke up about how the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid are saving their lives and saving their families from financial ruin. They poured their hearts out, they raised their voices, and they demanded to be heard. Last week they won.  The collapse of the Republicans' cruel scheme is a huge relief to millions of people in this country, but I am not here to celebrate. I am here to warn the American people about what is coming next, because instead of listening to the American people about what they want, the President of the United States has threatened to sabotage healthcare in It isn't subtle. One hour after the Republicans admitted they didn't have the votes in Congress to destroy the Affordable Care Act, President Trump sat behind his desk in the Oval Office and told the entire Nation that he wants to trigger a meltdown of our healthcare system because he thinks that would be helpful to him politically.  Just so there is no confusion, I want to quote him word for word. He said: ``The best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let ObamaCare explode.''  Now let's be clear. It is deeply wrong for the President of the United States--whose one and only job is to look out for the American people--to root for the failure of our country's healthcare system. It is deeply wrong for the President of the United States to announce that he is going to drag down our entire healthcare sector--a sector that accounts for more than one-sixth of the entire U.economy--just so he can stand on top of the wreckage and waggle his fingers and say: I told you so.  Healthcare for millions of Americans is not a game. It is not entertainment. It is not a reality TV show. Healthcare is literally life and death, and it touches everyone in this country from elderly grandparents to tiny babies.  President Trump is responsible for making healthcare in this country work. It is his job. He is President of the United His party controls both Houses of A legitimate President doesn't clap and cheer when things get worse for the American people. A legitimate President doesn't pound his chest about sabotaging the health and security of the American people because it is politically expedient. A legitimate President does his job.  The President's admission that he wants our healthcare system to collapse is a dangerous sign of where things are headed. For 7 years Republicans in Congress have rooted against healthcare in this country, cheering every stumble and working at every turn to hobble the law and make it harder for people to get affordable insurance. President Trump cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act on his own, but he can strip healthcare from millions of Americans and make it too expensive for millions more. He can do that all on his own. In fact, he is already working on it.  A few days after he took office, President Trump signed an Executive order directing his agency to use every tool at their disposal to try to disrupt the Affordable Care In January, he also pulled down government's efforts to get more people signed up for health insurance. Why? So fewer people would use the health exchanges, fewer would get insurance, and premiums would go up for those who did sign up--all in an effort to make ObamaCare fail.  Senator Patty Murray and I asked the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate this reckless move, and now an independent investigation has been launched into this despicable incident. But the President has more tools at his disposal to undercut the Affordable Care Act all by himself. The President can redefine what insurance plans have to cover, stripping out critical benefits like birth control coverage. The President can withhold payments that insurers rely on to keep private health plans affordable. The President can allow States to put new conditions on Medicaid, conditions like taking away healthcare coverage if a woman doesn't get back to work soon enough after giving birth.  If the President decides to launch an all-out effort to sabotage American healthcare so he can manufacture a crisis to score political points, he can hurt a lot of people.  But there is a better way. If Republicans want to work on ideas to actually improve healthcare in America, to expand coverage, to expand access, or to reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs, I am eager to throw up my sleeves and go to work. For years, Massachusetts has led the Nation in bipartisan health reform. We have lots to contribute on this, and lots of other Democrats are ready to get to work, too.  The American people aren't stupid. They know the difference between a bill that kicks 24 million people off of their health insurance and a bill that actually improves care. They know the difference between a President who fights to make health care better and a President who plans to sabotage healthcare. They know the difference between a fireman and an arsonist. If this President and this Congress continue to play politics with the lives of millions of people, I promise you that the American people will see it, they will know it, and they will rise up once again to fight it.

I would just like to point out that our Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Curtis Scaparrotti, last week declared that Montenegro's accession into NATO is ``absolutely critical,'' that they have had this desire. They have met the map, and they understand NATO'S outreach and ability to bring[[Page S1988]]in those who want to determine their own means of government and become part of  If we were to lose this, it would be a setback to many of the other nations and peoples, particularly in Eastern Europe, who were looking forward to and have their eyes on the West and becoming part of  I would point out to my colleagues that the Russians attach some importance to Montenegro because they tried a coup to overthrow the government. The Russians tried a coup to overthrow the government of this small, beautiful, and strategically important nation.  I would just point out that our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, wrote a letter urging Montenegro's membership to be ratified, saying that it was ``strongly in the interests of the United States.'' In his letter he strongly emphasized that Montenegro's accession to NATO would support greater integration, democratic reform, trade, and security and stability in the entire Balkans region.  I won't take too much time in the Senate except to say that I think this is more than an accession or non-accession of a small 750,000-person nation. It is a test in this contest that we are now engaged in with Vladimir Putin, who has committed to extending the reach and influence of the Russian Government and Russian influence to the point where he attempted a coup to overthrow the freely elected government of That coup failed, but I can assure my colleagues that if we turn down Montenegro, it will not remain the democracy that it is today.

963,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, Republicans are in charge of the Senate, and so far they haven't put up for a vote in this Congress a single piece of original legislation to help working families--not one. They haven't fixed a single piece of our crumbling infrastructure. They haven't put Americans back to work. They haven't brought down the soaring cost of prescription drugs. And they haven't done a thing to help the 55 million Americans who don't have access to a workplace retirement account to save for their retirement. But they have been busy.  Here is what they have done so far: They have made it easier for giant corporations to hide the payments they make to foreign countries. They have made it easier for companies to discharge filth into our rivers and streams. They have made it easier for Americans suffering from mental illness to buy guns. They have made it easier for hunters to shoot baby bears and wolf cubs from planes. They have made it easier for companies that get big-time, taxpayer-funded government contracts to steal wages from their employees. They have made it easier for employers to hide injuries their workers suffer on the job. They have made it easier for States to divert Federal education dollars away from struggling schools and students. They have made it easier for States to block people who are out of work from getting unemployment insurance payments that they are entitled to by law. And they have made it easier to keep local residents from having a say in how Federal lands are managed.  Now they are back at it again, this time to overturn a rule that will help millions of Americans start saving for their retirement. For years, the Republican-controlled Congress has done nothing to help the 55 million Americans who don't have an employer-provided retirement plan save for their retirement. Because of this Federal inaction, 7 States have passed legislation to provide retirement accounts to their constituents, and 23 others are considering proposals. The efforts of just those 7 States could expand coverage to 15 of the 55 million Americans who don't currently have an employer-sponsored retirement account.  In addition to these State efforts, three cities are actively considering proposals to curb the retirement savings gap, potentially covering another 2 million Extending coverage to 17 million Americans would go a long way toward starting to chip away at the retirement crisis in this country.  Today, among working families on the verge of retirement, about one-third have no retirement savings of any kind, and another one-third have total savings that are less than 1 year's income. This is a real problem, and Senate Republicans should be working hard to come up with solutions to fix it. But if they don't have any ideas of their own, the least they can do is step aside and let the hard-working Governors, mayors, State treasurers, city councils, and State legislatures continue their important efforts to try to solve our retirement crisis.  Every single time the Senate has come to the floor of this Congress to overturn an Obama administration rule, Republican Senators have said they were voting to remove burdensome Federal regulations that ``severely limit the role of State and local governments,'' when local governments ``could do a much better job of providing for the people of our State.'' So why on earth are they now voting to make it harder for cities and States to help their own citizens save for retirement? Why? Three words: chamber of commerce.  The chamber of commerce and the trade associations for the giant financial firms have been fighting tooth and nail to kill these retirement initiatives. Their armies of lobbyists have been deployed to peddle misinformation about what these plans do, all because the giant financial firms that the chamber of commerce and the trade associations represent are worried that the city and State plans might actually offer better investment products with lower fees.  The American people are not calling their Senators asking us to work day in and day out to overturn rules to help them save for their retirement; 72 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats support these initiatives. They aren't calling us and asking us to make their water dirty or to let their employer put their lives at risk by cutting corners on safety either.  The American voters didn't send us to Washington to work for the lawyers and the lobbyists and the giant corporations that keep corporate profits soaring by skirting basic regulations.  This vote may be really good for filling the campaign coffers of Senate Republicans, and a few of them may pop champagne corks with their buddies at the chamber of commerce after this vote tonight, but Americans are watching, and they will be ready to fight back.

1172,topic-id,810,"Mr.President, since coming to Washington, I have observed something interesting about Republican politicians. Republicans talk a big game about respecting women, but when it comes time to vote on laws to help real, live, American women, a lot of Republicans turn their backs.  Take Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House of Just a few months ago, Speaker Ryan was adamant that American women deserve respect. ``Women,'' he said, ``are to be championed and revered.''  ``Championed and revered''--so what exactly does championing and revering women mean to Speaker Ryan? Does it mean he will promote policies that make us healthier, that he will help us access basic medical services, that he thinks we can make our own decisions about our bodies without government interference?  Over the past few months, Speaker Ryan has worked overtime on the American Health Care Act--a bill that would make it harder for millions of women to access healthcare. That miserable bill even included a special provision singling out certain health clinics and stripping them of the funding they use to provide women's health services.  Last week, Paul Ryan failed to get that bill out of the House, but Republicans are back to take another shot at cutting women's access to healthcare. This time the plan is to undermine the title X family planning program. This plan, just like their healthcare bill, is incredibly unpopular, even with Republicans who had to rush Vice President Pence over from the White House this morning to cast a deciding vote to start this debate on attacking women's healthcare.  Title X is a bipartisan program started back in 1970. It is the only Federal grant program dedicated to providing Americans with high-quality, low-cost family planning services. Title X funded clinics provide birth control, cancer screening, STI testing, and counseling. Just so there is no confusion about this, title X dollars cannot be used to fund abortion services--none.  In 2015 alone, title X clinics helped 2.9 million women access birth control. They provided over 700,000 Pap smears, performed 1.1 million HIV tests, and gave over 1 million breast exams. And Paul Ryan's way of making sure that women are ``championed and revered'' is to try to reduce their access to these lifesaving services.  Last December, the Department of Health and Human Services passed a very simple rule to keep States from pulling political shenanigans to shut down women's health centers. The rule prevents States from blocking a healthcare provider from the program ``for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services.'' In other words, follow the law. If a provider is doing a bad job at delivering family planning services, by all means, kick them out of the program. But you don't get to kick someone out because you don't like the name of their organization or you don't like their politics or because of your politics or because of any other dumb reason that has nothing to do with their ability to deliver women's health services.  In February, House Republicans voted to overturn this rule. So Paul Ryan's version of championing and revering women is to let States close down women's health centers. Now Senate Republicans plan to do the same thing. Sure, Republicans give a bunch of reasons, but American women are not stupid. We know pretext when we see it. So let's just call it like it is. Republicans want to weaken the title X program because they want to make[[Page S2128]]it harder for women to access reproductive health clinics, like Planned Parenthood, that also provide safe, legal abortion services.  Just so we are clear, there are over 3,900 title X funded health centers. Only 10 percent of those health centers are affiliated with Planned The vast majority of centers getting title X money have nothing to do with Planned Parenthood, and the vast majority of Planned Parenthood's activities have nothing to do with abortion. But women should be able to choose a reproductive health provider without the interference of Republican politicians, and millions of women choose Planned Parenthood every year. The Congress representing those women should stop demonizing Planned Parenthood and stand with Planned  Yes, as it stands, title X makes sure that if women's healthcare centers, including Planned Parenthood, offer first-rate care, then their work will be reimbursed. The Senate should reject any efforts to change that.  Women in this country work their tails off. They should be able to choose their own healthcare providers. They don't need a ``champion'' to choose for them. They don't need to be ``revered'' into passive silence. Women want the respect that they deserve and to be able to access medical care without Republican politicians getting in the way.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

746,topic-id,2790,"Mr.President, I am here to give my weekly ``Time to Wake up'' speech. It is occurring on a day when the President has signed an Executive order that purports to be an effort to undo a good deal of work the American Government has done to address climate change. I have to say that it is a little bit hard to take this Executive order very seriously when the President is in trouble, which seems to be an everyday experience for him right now. The White House staff seems to entertain him and distract him by putting on these amateur theatricals in which they can give him a nice big folder that he can make a big signature on with a flourish and feel like he is doing something significant, when, in fact, these entertainments create little effect and mostly just confusion.  The administrative agencies that he is purporting to direct to stop taking action on climate change have a couple of differences from this particular Oval One is that they are obliged to follow the law and will be held to the law. The second is that under the Administrative Procedures Act, they have to follow real facts. They don't get to make up ``alternative facts'' in the fever swamp of the Breitbart imagination--at least not for long, because their record can be reviewed by courts. Finally, they can't make decisions that are, to use the standard of administrative law, ``arbitrary and capricious.'' This is an Oval Office that lives by ``arbitrary and capricious,'' but administrative agencies don't get to follow it there without having their rulings thrown out by courts.  So ultimately this is going to come down to lawyers and to courts, and lawyers and courts are actually pretty good places for addressing climate change seriously because it is very hard for the lies that are at the heart of climate denial to withstand cross-examination and to stand up to the obligation of witnesses to actually testify truthfully and under oath in court proceedings or even in administrative proceedings.  The inconsistencies of people's statements and behavior can be brought out through cross-examination, which has been described as ``the greatest engine for the discovery of truth ever invented.''  Discovery means that litigants get access to documents on the other side, and it also means that the court has a chance to look into conflicts of interest.  Administrator Pruitt, thanks to the backing of the fossil fuel industry, which is well on its way in trying to turn America into a banana republic through its interests, actually got through the Senate without ever having to disclose who funded his dark money operation. That alone is a kind of preposterous statement, but it is true, because the Senate majority wouldn't insist that those questions be answered because they were so all-fired eager to shove this fossil fuel tool into the Administrator's seat at Those questions never got answered.  Once there is a case brought against him in which he has to decide whether to recuse himself and that decision gets reviewed by a court, guess what. A court gets to have those questions answered. So there is going to be a lot more that gets discovered as this all goes forward.  The President, with the Executive order today, has made himself ridiculous, which is no great achievement given his recent record. He has made his administration ridiculous, which is unfortunate but not unexpected given the climate-denying crowd who has been given positions of responsibility in this administration. Unfortunately, he has also made the United States of America ridiculous, at least until the checks and balances of government set aright the forces unleashed by this ridiculous Executive order. So let's go on to something that is a little bit more fact-based and serious.  I take climate trips to various places. I went to Ohio back in 2015, and there I met two remarkable and very cool people: Ellen Mosley Thompson and her husband, Lonnie They have been married for 45 years, and that is also how long, more or less, they have been research partners. They do particularly amazing research. They are glaciologists. They study glaciers. They run the Byrd--as in Commander Byrd--Polar and Climate Research Center at Ohio They have spent years and years, decade after decade, studying the world's glaciers and leading expeditions to the far corners of the world to incredible places--to the North Pole, the South Pole, the Greenland ice cap, the high mountains of Peru, and glaciers in faraway  They gave me this on my visit. This is a little piece of a plant. You can look closely at it, and you can see the little sticks and leaves that are in it. This plant has an interesting history. It grew about 6,600 years ago, and when it grew and lived, woolly mammoths roamed the Woolly mammoths might have been eating neighboring plants. The human race was just entering the Bronze Age, and it began to snow. It snowed on this little plant. Snow piled on snow year after year, and this plant was buried under a glacier, preserved by the pressure and the cold. And there it stayed, so that now I can hold it up on the floor of the Senate 6,600-and-some years later.  Climate change is what brought me this plant because as temperatures steadily rise, glaciers the world over are melting. The glacier that buried this little plant 6,000 years ago receded so fast that here it is now--6,000 years in a glacier and now here in my hand in the  It is not just plants that are emerging from this great melting. We are actually seeing remains of our own long-dead ancestors emerge from melting glaciers. This is all becoming so common that a new field of study has been created--glacial archeology.  For my 162nd ``Time to Wake up'' speech, I will share the story of the warming Arctic and our world's disappearing glaciers.  The Thompsons, when they leave Ohio State and travel, drill down into the ice, and they take deep core samples out of the glacier, long tubes of ice from the glacier. For Ellen and Lonnie, that means long trips and some challenging logistics, making sure that packed-down ice and snow containing hundreds of thousands of years of accumulated snow and ice doesn't melt along the way back to their lab at Ohio State because in those hundreds of thousands of years of accumulated snow and ice are hundreds of thousands of years of data.  I remember going to visit them. They store the core samples from these glaciers around the world in a huge walk-in freezer. It is like a library with metal shelving, except instead of having books on the shelves, it has these tubes, and they are marked as to where they were drilled out. You can pull the tubes off the shelf and take them to a viewer, and they have a light underneath it, and you can look at the light coming through it. You can see bubbles in the glass that captured the atmosphere from thousands of years ago, and you can draw the air out of those ancient bubbles and learn what the atmosphere was like back then.  There was a line through the core that they showed me, and I asked them: What is this line in the core? They said: Well, that was a really bad sandstorm. It is actually written about in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, and we can connect the timing of those ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs talking about this terrific sandstorm and going back through time, the date. And we know that this dark line in the core reflects that big storm that ancient[[Page S2053]]Egyptians wrote about thousands of years ago.  There are other researchers doing similar things. France and Italy have researchers creating a separate ice core repository, and they have dubbed their project ``Protecting Ice Memory.'' Their bunker for these cores is going to be 33 feet under Antarctica's surface, where they hope to be able to keep the cores cold for posterity because given the rate of climate change, these carefully preserved, packed-away, and frozen ice core samples are probably going to be the last record we have of all the information that was left in and lost in melting glaciers.  This photo depicts Grinnell Glacier in Montana in what is now called Glacier National This was a picture that was taken in 1940. You can see the glacier here pushing up into the mountain. In this photo, you can now see the glacier as it is here. If it is not clear, all of this is not glacier; it is lake, it is water.  The U.Geological Survey described what was going on as Grinnell Glacier lost 90 percent of its ice in this last century. Here is what the U.Geological Survey said:       Glacier recession is underway, and many glaciers have      already disappeared. The retreat of these small alpine      glaciers reflects changes in recent climate as glaciers      respond to altered temperature and precipitation. It has been      estimated that there were approximately 150 glaciers present      in 1850, and most glaciers were still present in 1910 when      the park was established. In 2010, we consider there to be      only 25 glaciers larger than 25 acres remaining in Glacier      National  There were 150 glaciers 100 years ago and 25 now. I wonder what they will call Glacier Park when all the glaciers are gone.  This was--is or was, depending on what you look at--Lillian Glacier up in the State of Washington in Olympic National On the top, we see the healthy glacier in 1905. In 2010, it is virtually all gone. There are just little bits of snow in exposed mountain.  Glacier loss is not just happening in our parks in the United States; it is happening all over the world. A man named Christian Aslund has been documenting this recently, and National Geographic has printed his work. What he did was go to the archives of the Norwegian Polar Institute, and he found pictures of glaciers in Svalbard, Norway, back from the 1920s--old black and white pictures. Then he went back to the exact same spot from which the old picture was taken, and he took a picture. Most of these are from 2003, so some time has gone by since he took the picture, and the situation has actually gotten worse.  You will see here that these two mountaintops that are sticking above this glacier are these two mountaintops right there, but, of course, the glacier is no longer there. You just see a bit of snow back there behind the shore.  Here you see this vast wall of ice and the glacier pushing back up into these mountains behind it.  Here the wall of ice is essentially gone. You see this whole mountain front that has opened up, and the glacier is now simply back up in the valley behind it.  You can see the glacier here from the 1920s filling up this valley and the streams coming off the base of it down there.  Here you see the glaciers completely gone. The rock is exposed, and there is a lake at the bottom, and you have to actually look over the top of the mountain to this faraway peak to even see any snow in the photograph.  It is the same story elsewhere in the The Greenland ice sheet is the world's second largest glacier landmass.  A study last year from the journal Science Advances found that we might have underestimated the current rate of mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet by about 20 billion tons per year.  As ``Science'' magazine recently highlighted, the accelerating surface melt of ice and snow off the Greenland ice sheet, since 2011, has doubled--Greenland's contribution to global sea level rise. It is a phenomenon that the Presiding Officer sees and hears about in his home State of Florida all the time. All told, the melting Greenland ice sheet holds the equivalent of more than 23 feet of sea level rise in its ice. That would be a lot in That would be a lot in That would change the map of the United States of  Why are these glaciers changing and shrinking? Obviously because the Earth is warming and ice melts. Over the last 150 years, industrial activities of modern civilization have caused the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. Their emissions have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and we have known since Abraham Lincoln was President that that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.  What we are learning more and more is how much the warming of the planet accelerates at the The distribution of the warming is not even across the Things are warming much faster at the The Norwegian Polar Institute found that the rate of warming in the Arctic is about twice as high as the global average. For one thing, when snow and ice melt, they can expose darker surfaces underneath, whether it is water or Earth or rock, and a darker surface will absorb more solar energy than reflective snow and ice, and that warms the region even faster. So climate change has this compounding effect in the high latitudes.  Temperatures in the Arctic were the highest in recorded history for the period between December 2016 and February 2017. The World Meteorological Organization noted that ``at least three times so far this winter, the Arctic has witnessed the polar equivalent of a heat wave.'' What this means in layman's terms is that when the ice in the Arctic should have been freezing in the deep midwinter, it was actually melting. More warming and more melting mean more sea level rise.  Last year, researchers published in ``Nature'' an updated estimate of global sea level rise as this phenomenon accelerates. The prediction is not pretty. This new study doubles the previous estimate, putting global sea level rise over 6 feet by the end of this century.  This led to the January NOAA report that I discussed last week which updated global sea level rise region-specific assessments for our U.coastline. The report raised the previous upper range or extreme scenario for average global sea level rise in the year 2100 by 20 inches, to a total of 8.2 feet.  NOAA and its partners' findings were particularly harsh for the western Gulf of Mexico--the back side of Florida, if you will--and the northeast Atlantic coast; that is, Virginia through Maine, including my home State of Rhode Coastal managers, like Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, or CRMC, are taking these new estimates very seriously and incorporating the ``high'' scenario into their planning, with the local high scenario now projected for Rhode Island by our CRMC at between 9 and 12 vertical feet of sea level rise. And, of course, when you go up 9 feet or 12 feet, you go back many hundreds of feet in many places. And all of this, whether it is happening in Florida or whether it is happening in Rhode Island or whether it is happening in other coastal States, it all starts with warming seas and melting glaciers.  When National Geographic caught up with Aslund a few weeks ago, he said something striking: ``What's happening in the Arctic is spreading around the whole globe.'' These pictures he had taken 14 years ago now--back in 2003--were just the beginning.  Kiribati, an island nation, has to face the real consequences of climate change and sea level rise. It is preparing to become a modern-day Atlantis--lost forever to the waves. Aslund describes a meeting with Kiribati's President: ``He knows climate change is just a fact . . . they're buying upland in Fiji so they can evacuate in the future.''  I will end with one final quote from Mr.When asked about the devastating effects of climate change that he had seen firsthand, he responded: ``It is the biggest challenge we face and we must act now before it is too late.''  Do one man's photographs stand any chance against the massive deception apparatus orchestrated by the fossil fuel industry, when they can call in a President of the United States for as ridiculous and preposterous an Executive order as he signed today? It is hard to know.  I hope this body will rise to its best traditions and meet the needs of its constituents, whether they are coastal constituents threatened by sea level rise or farm constituents threatened by[[Page S2054]]changes in weather or forest constituents who are seeing the pine beetle destroy western forests by the millions of acres. I hope we wake up before it becomes too late.

932,topic-id,1854,"Mr.President, with the Republican plan to defeat the Affordable Care Act itself defeated, President Trump says he wants to move beyond healthcare to focus on other priorities. One area that he has often highlighted is our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, which is a priority that many of us share and is something I would like to discuss today.  All of our kids, I suspect, dread having to bring home a lousy report card. They would be facing a serious talk.  Every 4 years, the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a report card for American infrastructure. Our 2017 report card--out just this month--shows lousy marks across the board for American infrastructure. Our ports and bridges got C-pluses, flat Ds for both drinking water infrastructure and roads, and our energy grid got a D-plus. Overall, the United States took home a D-plus grade point average. It is not pretty, and not an improvement over the scores we got 4 years earlier.  A report card is a progress report, and our grades show we are not making progress. So it is time to get serious about the sorry state of America's roads, bridges, ports, and pipes, which literally keep our economy moving.  The Civil Engineers estimate that we need an additional $2 trillion in infrastructure investments over the next 10 years to get our infrastructure back to a B grade level. The study also found that there is a cost for lousy infrastructure--that we are set to lose nearly $4 trillion in GDP and $7 trillion in lost business sales by 2025, which would result in 2.5 million fewer jobs that year.  America's declining infrastructure also faces growing demand. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates an additional 100 million more people will rely on our transportation system by midcentury. The U.Department of Transportation says that we can expect twice the level of freight traffic on our highways and roads by then, so our already worn-down infrastructure is going to take an even heavier beating. We have to be ready for this. We have to make smart investments in the infrastructure backbone of American commerce. We should make those investments now, and we should make them for the long term.  I am hopeful. Transportation infrastructure has been a rare bipartisan bright spot in After all, our red States and our blue States both have bridges that age and water mains that rupture.  Congress has tried many times to push large bipartisan infrastructure bills. In the 112th Congress, a bipartisan group led by Senators Kerry, Graham, and Hutchinson, introduced the BUILD Act to create a national infrastructure bank that would have authorized up to $10 billion to underwrite transportation, water, and energy projects.  The Partnership to Build America Act, introduced in the 113th Congress by Senators Bennet and Blunt, also proposed an American infrastructure fund, this time financed with a form of tax repatriation.  In the 114th Congress, we were actually able to pass the first long-term transportation law in 10 years. The FAST Act--short for Fixing America's Surface Transportation--authorized more than $300 billion in transportation infrastructure investment over a 5-year period.  We also passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act to address drinking water emergencies and authorize a number of new Army Corps of Engineers projects, including the removal of pilings and debris from the Providence River in Rhode These bipartisan successes, however, barely put a dent in our Nation's total infrastructure needs.  Out on the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump spoke broadly of a $1 trillion infrastructure push. I agree we have to make that investment in America's infrastructure, but we also need to make sure we get real commitment from Washington, not just public-private partnerships and nebulous tax cuts. To bring our roads and bridges into the 21st century, we need a far-reaching infrastructure program like Franklin Roosevelt's Works Progress  The Joint Economic Committee's Democratic contingent put out a report analyzing the President's proposal to use investor tax credits to close our infrastructure gap. What they found was that using these tax credits alone would actually ``cost nearly 55 percent more than traditional infrastructure financing.'' We can't let infrastructure turn into a special interest boondoggle.  In the absence of any sort of Executive plan or strategy, Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Schumer, put forward our own blueprint to rebuild America's infrastructure. It would invest $1 trillion in the Nation's infrastructure, as the President wished, creating over 50 million American jobs. The blueprint encompasses not just roads and bridges but parks, schools, hospitals, and airports. It calls for investing $100 billion in smalltown communities that need revamped infrastructure, over $100 billion in aging water and sewer systems, $50 billion in our railways, over $100 billion in public transportation, and $30 billion in our essential port infrastructure. It would put billions toward modernizing our energy grid by connecting rural areas and driving investment in clean energy.  It includes strong support for American workers--something the President claims as a priority--with ``Buy American'' provisions to promote American-made products and protections like the Davis-Bacon law to make sure Americans earn fair wages.  For a coastal State like Rhode Island, which has to prepare for rising seas and increased storm surges from climate change, the blueprint includes $25 billion to improve coastal infrastructure and make coastal communities more resilient. This includes competitive critical infrastructure resiliency funding, a new Resilient Communities Revolving Loan Fund, and support for the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund, which I authored sometime ago to research, restore, and reinforce our cause. Our plan is big, it is bold, and it should garner the support of anyone who says they want to improve America's infrastructure and create jobs at home.  This work is vitally important in my home The American Society of Civil Engineers' report card shines a light on Rhode Island's particular infrastructure woes. It shows we need $148 million for drinking water infrastructure needs and nearly $2 billion for wastewater infrastructure fixes over the next 20 years. We have $4.7 million of backlogged park system repairs and a $241 million gap in needed upgrades at schools.  More than half of our roads are in poor condition. A lot of our infrastructure, unlike Alaska, dates back to colonial days when the foundations of our roads were first traveled by ox carts. This state of disrepair costs my constituents a lot of money. I have been told by the transportation research group TRIP that driving on cracked and crumbling roads in Rhode Island costs our motorists $604 million per year--more than $810 per motorist, per year, in vehicle repair and operating costs from banging into potholes.  In our State, 56 percent of the bridges are deficient or obsolete. That, I am sorry to say, is the worst rate in the country. Those bridges have been around a long time in many cases, and they are literally falling down piece by piece. It can be pretty shocking to see.  This photo shows part of the 6/10 Connector in The interchange is a vital link in the State's highway network for vehicles traveling between[[Page S2067]]Interstates 95, 195, and 295. It was built in stages through the 1950s, and it can no longer accommodate the approximately 100,000 automobiles and heavy trucks that travel on it each day. Our department of transportation has spent millions of dollars on temporary maintenance to keep the interchange shored up and in operation, but you can see that this type of jury-rigging is not a lasting solution.  While Rhode Island directs millions of State funds to repair and replacement of these structures, we need some Federal financing to ensure that this work gets done before a serious failure occurs, which could disrupt commerce up and down the entire Northeast  The evidence of dangerous disrepair is all over my This photo depicts a crumbling bridge on Route 37, the east-west freeway servicing the cities of Cranston and The tumbledown cement and rusting ironwork are not reassuring. Here is another graphic showing a rusted and ramshackle bridge over Highway 95. We can save money in the long term--a stitch in time saves nine--if we can get on to these repairs and get these bridges fixed.  We also have to consider the bridges, roads, ports, rails, and other transit systems in the Ocean State that are, as you might imagine, very close to our coast. This infrastructure is at particular risk from sea level rise, from storm surge, and from the more severe storms that come at us offshore, driven by warming seas and climate change.  Recently, NOAA released updated global sea level rise estimates, and they focused those global estimates on the U.coastline. The estimate for their ``extreme'' scenario--that is, if we continue to emit high levels of carbon pollution--was increased by half a meter, to a total of 2.5 meters or over 8 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100.  My State's Coastal Resources Management Council has adopted the ``high'' scenario for planning purposes and made the adjustments for the local conditions, and they now put 9 vertical feet of sea level rise as the expectation for Rhode Island's coast by 2100. Of course, as any coastal Senator knows, when you go straight up 9 feet, you can go a long way back, pushing the shoreline into what is now inland, flooding a lot of infrastructure.  We need to protect evacuation routes from flooding, we need to bolster hurricane barriers, and we need to replenish beaches and nourish wetlands. To protect infrastructure from storms, we need to raise ports and reinforce bridges that are exposed to corrosive saltwater from storms. We need to manage upstream reservoirs to control downstream flooding. We need to protect groundwater drinking water supplies from intruding saltwater. We need to retrofit lowland wastewater treatment plants that are in danger of flooding. Some of them are not just in flood zones, they are actually in velocity zones where wave action is expected against the structures. These improvements are essential to meeting our infrastructure needs over the coming decade.  Every coastal State--especially those in the Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico, which are expected to see the most dramatic rises in sea level--should be nervous. That is why the Democratic infrastructure blueprint includes funding for resilient coastal communities, including support for the National Oceans and Coastal Security I have worked to establish this lifeline for coastal infrastructure since my early days in the Once we fund it, it can be a tremendous resource for coastal communities needing infrastructure improvement and smart coastal adaptation.  President Trump has said he wants a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. I am ready to roll up my sleeves and ``git 'er done.'' Democrats have put forward a blueprint for making the investments our Nation so badly needs. Congress can come together on a plan that can provide direct, long-term support and help communities address current needs, while also preparing for the changes we know are coming down the pipeline at us.

30,topic-id,1012,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate all the hard work the Rules Committee chairman has done in this bill. Mr.Speaker, I have the great pleasure of serving on the Rules Committee, but I am the designee to the Budget  This whole process that we are going through is a Budget Committee process. It is called reconciliation. And as folks have talked about it, they have talked about what the Ways and Means Committee has done and what the Energy and Commerce Committee did. But then those two bills come together in the Budget Committee, and we move the process forward.  I can't help but notice my colleagues' frustration with the amendments that have been made to this bill along the way. Generally, we celebrate amendments that are made along the way because they improve the work product. We do them together.  I point here, Mr.Speaker, to a tweet that the President sent out the day the healthcare bill was introduced. The President said:  ``Our wonderful new HealthCare Bill is now out for review and negotiation.''  And that was true. It was out for review so everyone could read it, and it was out for negotiation so that everyone could improve it.  We did that in the Budget We had four motions to instruct that passed in the Budget Committee to provide Medicaid flexibility, to make sure the tax credits were targeted to the right populations, to ensure that able-bodied, working Americans had those incentives to both get health care and be able to go back to work.  Now, every committee didn't have that experience. As my colleagues have asked for a bipartisan process, you will remember that the Energy and Commerce Committee spent 10 hours debating the title of the bill. They spent 10 hours debating Democratic amendments to change the title of the bill. Folks, we have opportunity after opportunity to make things better, but it is incumbent upon us to choose that opportunity to make things better.  So often we get wrapped around the partisan action. Folks let that opportunity slip away. I am glad that we didn't do that.  Mr.Speaker, when I talk about what we did in the Budget Committee to make it better, I am talking about focusing on the real problems. There is not a member in this body that doesn't understand that what is contributing to the ObamaCare death spiral is that young people are not enrolling. Young people are not enrolling.  More Americans rejected ObamaCare and filed for an exemption or agreed to pay the penalty than enrolled in I don't care how big your heart was when you passed the bill, you have to concede that wasn't what you intended. And we can do better.[[Page H2382]]  My friends are talking about the essential health benefits plan today. Young people are particularly sensitive to that. They are price sensitive in that way. We are talking in the Budget Committee about how to preserve that flexibility for States to design plans that are right for them.  How many times today have we heard folks say that prices are going to increase for Americans between the age of 54 and 64?  I have heard it at least a dozen times. At the same time, my friends are demanding that every healthcare plan in the State of Georgia cover maternity benefits for those women between the age of 54 and 64. At the same time, my friends are demanding that every plan in Georgia cover pediatric benefits for those empty nesters between 54 and 64. That doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. We in Georgia know it doesn't make sense, and we can do better.  Mr.Speaker, 45 percent of the almost 20 million people who rejected the Affordable Care Act and agreed to pay the fine or file an exemption instead were under the age of 35. There is not a serious thinker in this room who believes we can solve the insurance crisis in this country without getting these folks back into the marketplace. And that is what we did in the Budget That is what we have done throughout this entire amendment process, and that is what the amendments we considered in the Rules Committee this morning did as well.  Mr.Speaker, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, many States have had to pass a lot of legislation in order to conform their plans to new one-size-fits-all Federal mandates. But that is not the story. The story is that, at the same time, States were passing their own benefit mandates to serve their constituency better.  Mr.Speaker, Chairman Session's State of Texas passed a mandate that orally administered anticancer medication be covered. The gentleman from Texas has seen those groups in his office. He has seen those families struggling. And what Texas said is: To respond to our people, we are going to require every plan sold in the State of Texas cover these issues.  In my home State, Mr.Speaker, we created a commission to look at annually how to add more benefits, change those benefits, make sure we are being responsive to folks in the best way that we can.  The gentleman from Colorado, his State did the very same thing. They required coverage for acupuncture services. They required the selling of child-only plans. They required coverage for fetal alcohol syndrome. We do these things collaboratively, and we do these things together.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of the rule and passage of the underlying legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I notice the gentleman from Georgia relied on a tweet from Donald Trump for his facts in explaining the bill. I might suggest a more scholarly source, maybe, like, beginning with the Congressional Budget Office, which says that 24 million people will lose their health coverage as a result of the bill.

President Obama, in 2011, issued an executive order about how agencies should go about making the regulatory process more effective. He said, and I quote: ``Each agency shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific and technological information and processes used to support the agency's regulatory actions.''  We talk so much about what divides us in this institution, in this town, sometimes even in this country, Mr.Speaker, I think that point is worth dwelling on.  Again, quoting from former President Barack Obama: ``Each agency shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific and technological information and processes used to support the agency's regulatory actions.''  It is what the HONEST Act aims to do, Mr.It aims to provide the American public with the data that the EPA uses in each of its regulatory actions.  It would come as a surprise to many Americans, Mr.Speaker, to learn that there are Agency actions that take place based entirely on undisclosed data sets, that the regulatory arm of government can be at work based on secret data that will never be released to the American public to verify, to confirm in this what is often, in scientific communities, referred to as peer-reviewed literature.  We believe that, if we are making the rules, we should be able to expose the data on which those rules are based to scrutiny and, in fact, to challenge, Mr. One thing I have learned in this job is sometimes I am not as smart as I think I am. I don't know if that has ever happened to you, Mr.I am sure it has never happened to my friend from But sometimes we are not as smart as we think we are. Sometimes being challenged makes us better.  The HONEST Act, Mr.Speaker, aims to provide the opportunity simply by looking at the data for any American citizen to understand the regulatory actions being taken at the EPA, and, yes, if necessary, to challenge those actions if they believe they are not based on sound science.  Mr.Speaker, I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: Is this bill necessary? The EPA's mission is to protect the environment and public health, so, of course, it is going to use the best science.  The answer should be yes. The answer should be yes that in every set of circumstances we are always using the very best data. But as you know, time and time again, you can bring an expert into your office. A scientist on one side of the issue will tell you one thing; a scientist on the other will bring an equally compelling compendium of information to tell you the next. It is left to us, to the American people, to decide who is right and who is wrong.  This is nothing to be feared. This is something to be embraced. It has certainly been a characteristic of our great country for over 200 years.  But in these days of information pouring out of the administration at the speed of the internet, it is more critical than ever that we make that information available to the public. With the ability today to understand that information, to process that information, to compile that information, to inspect that information in details never before imagined, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that America has that opportunity.

Number two, there is no smoke-filled backroom deal here. Number one, there is no smoke-filled room anywhere on Capitol Speaker Boehner is gone, and smoking is banned from all of our spaces. This bill went through a full committee hearing, the full committee process. So often, Mr.Speaker, you know at the beginning of a year like this one, we are trying to move legislation to the floor quickly. Some things that we have already had hearings and debate on, like this bill, from last Congress, we bring to the floor outside of regular order, and we skip the committee hearing process. Not so with this bill. It went through the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for a full hearing.  Mr.Speaker, we talk about transparency as if it exists at the I will remind my friend from Colorado, Mr.Speaker, we have to issue subpoenas from the United States Congress to get the EPA to share its data with us, notwithstanding to get them to share it with the University of Georgia or Georgia Tech or Caltech, or wherever the best scientific minds of the day are. We have to issue subpoenas to get them to share that information. Clearly, transparency is not the norm, it is the exception.  We talk about costs. My friend references $1 billion in costs from some study, apparently, not a peer-review study. I have not seen the data backing up this study. But the good news is I don't actually need the study. I have the bill itself, Mr.Speaker, and I will turn to the relevant part here. Paragraph 5, clarify that the administrator shall implement this section in a matter that does not exceed $1 million per year from the amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated. Now, you don't have to spend the entire million dollars, Mr.Speaker, but in the name of transparency, to make sure that folks have access to the data, we have said it is worth investing resources but not to exceed $1 million.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, we talk about the burden of red tape. I don't know if you have had to deal with the EPA or the DOT or the DOD or the DOE--insert DO acronym here--red tape is abundant in this Federal Government, and asking the Federal Government to be transparent is the antithesis of red tape. Since when did it become a burden on the institutions of government to be transparent with the American people? Since when, when you are making rules and regulations that affect the lives of every single American, did it become a burden to share the data on which those regulations are based?  I will say to you, Mr.Speaker, we get wrapped around the axle so often here that we end up getting further and further from our goals. Sharing data, getting peer-reviewed comments on that data, and having folks come out in support of the conclusions reached on that data are going to make us stronger as a nation not weaker. If you are proud of your underlying data, you should be proud to share that data. If you are embarrassed of your underlying data, I understand why you might want to keep it a secret.  We have an opportunity not to hide from science but to embrace science, we have an opportunity not to reach political conclusions but scientific conclusions, and we have an opportunity to restore the American people's trust in the institutions of government that are issuing these regulations. This is a small step in the right direction with the HONEST Act, Mr.Speaker, but it is an important step in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will support it.

496,topic-id,1602,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I often wonder what it is like to be in your position there, a distinguished career as a judge, and you come down here to talk about the EPA and whether or not the rules and regulations should be based on sound science or not, and you end up with a discussion over the There is no objection that can be lodged here for going outside of the scope of the bill.  I can always tell, when I come down for Rules Committee debate, whether or not we are really talking about something that divides us or whether we are just talking. If we are talking about something that divides us, we spend every moment of the hours that we have debating the nitty-gritty of the issue before us--talking about how quickly should that data be disclosed; how many folks should have access to it. Are there going to be episodes where the data needs to be kept super secret and folks can't be trusted with it? What should we do about new and emerging business practices, propriety technologies? How do we deal with those questions?  I enjoy those rules, Mr.Speaker, because we are doing exactly what we came here to do, and that is to delve into the details and get it right for the American people.  What I am led to believe on a day like today is that we are pretty close to getting it right for the American people because we are not talking about the nitty-gritty of the legislation. We are talking about the Clean Power Plan that the past administration put forward. We are not talking about the details of the legislation; we are talking about the Russians today. I think that is because there aren't many things much more common sense than sharing with the American people that data on which the laws of the land are made.  Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt that the EPA is involved in a complicated line of work, a critically important line of work.  I can't find a single constituent in the great State of Georgia that doesn't believe in clean water and clean air. I can find a whole lot of them who think that they believe more in clean water and clean air than does any institution in Washington, D.I promise you, no one cares more about the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area than those of us who live along the Chattahoochee River National Recreation  Nobody cares more about protecting the Earth in the great State of Georgia than those farmers who are creating the largest export we have in the great State of Georgia, which are our agriculture products.  We are in this together, which is why, when this bill came before the House last Congress, it passed with a bipartisan vote. These are commonsense ideas that bring us together more than they divide us.  Mr.Speaker, I think the real surprise is that folks believe the EPA to be transparent, and learn that it is not. Folks would not believe that this Congress has to subpoena information in order to get its hands on it.  What this bill would say is not only should Congress be able to access the information, but any reputable scientist should be able to access the information.  What my friend says about privacy concerns, they are a shared concern in this institution. There is absolutely nothing in this underlying legislation that threatens those privacy concerns. In fact, it requires that all private information be redacted before the information be utilized.[[Page H2478]]  Concerns over cost, again, are absolutely important, but I will read from the committee report: ``This bill does not contain any new budget authority, spending authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures.''  That it is a pretty simple bill and a pretty simple rule. It asks that we lift the curtain of secrecy around the regulations that protect our health and safety. It asks that we make health and safety issues not things that divide us around process, but things that unite us around results.  Candidly, I came to this institution to achieve those results, Mr.Speaker, and I am proud to be carrying this rule to the floor today. I encourage all of my colleagues to please support this bill, and with its passage we can get to the underlying legislation, end the shroud of secrecy, and restore public confidence in the laws that protect all of our health and safety.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 229 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived.

If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

955,topic-id,1773,"Mr.President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank my friend from Illinois for his very thoughtful and warm remarks about somebody who we all admired very much, Ed  I remember so many times talking to him about the rights of seniors, and a lot of us who thought we knew something about the subject didn't know half of what Ed did. This was a guy with a really razor-sharp mind, but he had an even bigger heart, and particularly a heart for people without clout and power. I don't think it was an accident that he gravitated to the senior Senator from Illinois, I might add as well.  So I thank my friend for his very gracious remarks about somebody we all admired very much.  Mr.President, I am here this afternoon because from the people who brought us TrumpCare, which was so favorable to the fortunate few and the special interests, now comes legislation that is going to make it harder for working people and working families to save for their own retirement. To kind of put that in context, whenever we have a debate about retirement, we always hear people say: You know, you just ought to realize that Social Security, this earned benefit--an earned benefit for Americans--you have to realize it is not going to cover everything. You have to save privately. You have to save for your retirement. And now, what we are seeing is the powerful special interests--the people with deep pockets and great political influence--are talking about restricting the chance for those typical working families to do the very thing that those people usually say is the solution. They say: No, we can't have government programs; you have to save privately for your retirement. And now come along those very powerful special interests, and they want to talk about restricting the ability of working families to save privately.  So we are now debating the first of two resolutions that would put a huge dark cloud over the new programs with individual retirement accounts, called auto-IRA programs, that States like mine and a handful of cities are seeking to build.  Right now, immediately, it is the locally based programs that are trying to promote private savings, giving the working-class family the chance to do it, and they are the ones who could be undermined. Of course, depending on what happens around here, the State programs could be next.  So at this time in American history, when we are facing a very large challenge with respect to savings, when a little over half of the workers approaching retirement age have nothing--zero--saved in retirement accounts such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k) plans, these two resolutions amount to a game plan that would take the savings crisis, which is already bad, and make it worse.  Around 55 million Americans don't have access to a retirement plan at work. More often than not, it is the employees of small- and medium-sized businesses who don't have that job benefit, and it is no fault of their own. In my view, this shouldn't even be a partisan question. There ought to be bipartisan interests in helping these workers find new opportunities to save. It ought to be easier than it is today.  I see my friend and colleague from the Finance Committee in the Chair, and as he knows, we have had countless committee hearings in the Finance We have been part of multiple floor debates when I have heard Members on both sides of the aisle talk about the importance of private savings. Yet here we are in the Senate, and yet we are looking at an effort on the part of the majority at this point that wants to ram through resolutions that would make it harder to save, not easier.  So juxtapose what is going on today and then think about all of the committee hearings in the Finance Committee, in the HELP Committee, where we hear people talk about private savings. We ought to make it easier; we ought to have smarter policies. Today the U.Senate is looking at making it harder for working families to save.  Here is a little bit of background about this and what it means to my home State of Oregon, and we are looking at winning the NCAA championship here in a few days, so there are a lot of things we are talking about in Oregon right now. But I wanted to especially come and talk about another area where we are leading right now; that is, trying fresh approaches to retirement savings.  Oregonians want as a State to help close the gap for the 55 million Americans without an employer-sponsored plan. After a lot of study and careful planning, my home State of Oregon is one of a handful of States that have passed what has come to be known as an auto-The actual name of the program is OregonSaves, and it is set to launch this summer.  What it means--and the highlight of it is this is a voluntary program--is we are creating a new set of opportunities for workers to actually save. What it means in my State is if you are a worker at one of these businesses, when you get a job, you will get a retirement account, and you will be able to start saving.  Now, I want to emphasize that it is not mandatory. Any worker who wants to opt out could do so, but it is designed to be simple and easy to use for everybody involved.  I wish to describe for a moment some of my conversations with Oregonians and workers who have been part of these auto They come up at townhall meetings in every county of my State--I have had a little over 800 now--and we have discussed savings. They come up often, and they say: I have been hearing about these new IRAs, and I am automatically enrolled in one.  Then they say: You know, if they hadn't automatically enrolled me in it, I probably wouldn't have done it because there is always an expense in our[[Page S2086]]household, there is always something we think we probably should do, and we would say to ourselves: We had better do that now, and we can come back and talk about saving later.  Those employees have come up and said: We probably wouldn't have done it without this automatic enrollment. But, Ron, I am so glad that we have it because I have seen that this is really beneficial, and it in effect has persuaded me that I have to take a very disciplined approach. I am glad this is automatic, and I especially like the fact that I have the last word on the subject. In other words, if I feel for one reason or another I can't do this automatic savings, there would be an opportunity for me to opt out.  It is automatic, and it provides this path for people to start saving. It is cost-effective. It is straightforward for employers. It eliminates a lot of redtape and administrative hassle. Most importantly, it gives the worker the last word--the right to opt out of this.  The Trump administration says it wants to cut redtape that burdens business. In my view, this legislation does the opposite. It makes it harder for small businesses to provide retirement savings programs for their workers.  One after the other, Oregon employers are raving about the opportunity the program represents for them, especially when it comes to recruiting and retaining top-notch employees and helping those workers build a nest egg. I just gave a little bit of empirical evidence from these community meetings I hold where workers say they particularly like what this does. It is almost like a little bit of a nudge to save and build a nest egg.  Judi Randall, the finance director of an affordable housing provider in Roseburg, OR, says it would make a big difference for a rural nonprofit organization like hers to have OregonSaves available to help employees secure their retirement.  Joy Andersen, another Oregon leader, is the administrator at the Asher Community Health Center in Fossil, I had my first community meeting in this small town of about 500. Joy has talked about how important it is to her to have an attractive retirement plan to recruit employees to come work in Fossil in eastern  Kevin Max runs Statehood Media in Bend, a small company with big aspirations. He notes that there is no better State in the country than Oregon when it comes to employee recruitment. He says that OregonSaves gives companies like his another leg up with an even better package of benefits.  I believe it defies logic that in light of all of these positive returns from employers and from workers, that the Congress would want to stamp out a program like OregonSaves which has so much potential, but the resolution going after State initiatives--and there are two--would pose that kind of threat.  My view is that these are not easy programs for States or cities to set up. There are legal issues that date back decades that have to be worked through. There is a lot of heavy lifting at the Labor Department to get the legal roadblocks out of the way. If these resolutions pass, it would wipe out months and months of work that has gone into making this kind of State- and local-based partnership possible.  This particular issue ought to be a no-brainer. Saving in the private economy is the right thing, as I have said, for a host of reasons. People scrimping and saving to set aside money for retirement is the key to a healthy retirement policy so everybody is in a position to have a dignified retirement rather than stretching every penny they have, relying just on Social Security, family members, and food banks to make ends meet. I believe our people want the opportunity to save, and they like the idea of this automatic IRA because it is fair to workers and fair to employers.  My view is that the Senate ought to stand up and recognize that by voting against these ill-advised resolutions, this is a chance to support the interests of working people who would like to save in the private economy, ahead of special interests. I hope the Senate will do the right thing for those hard-working people and their families and vote these resolutions down.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1201,topic-id,259,"Mr.President, I hear colleagues from the other side of the aisle talk again and again about how they want patient-centered healthcare. That is the refrain--patient-centered healthcare. Make no mistake about what this resolution is all about. It turns that phrase on its head because what it says to certainly women who are patients: You are not free to go get the healthcare you want.  It seems like this never ends--another day, another effort to deny women the opportunity to have the kinds of healthcare choices and the healthcare services that they feel strongly about.  I am not going to take long; I know colleagues are in a hurry.

I have heard Senator Murray talk about it. She says it very eloquently.

65,topic-id,1136,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, after 7 years of campaigning against the Affordable Care Act, congressional Republicans have finally produced what they cynically describe as a replacement plan.  Sadly, however, this bill will unravel all of the progress we made under the ACA, including expanding access to health insurance to 22 million Americans and improving the quality of coverage and care for tens of millions more.  It nearly doubles the amount of uninsured people in this country, guts Medicaid by almost $900 billion, and weakens the Medicare trust fund.                              {time}  1130  That was bad enough. But the last-minute changes to this bill are astonishing and appalling. This legislation now allows insurers to end coverage for prescription drugs, mental health, maternity and newborn care, preventive care, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, outpatient care, rehab visits, lab services, and pediatric care. That is not progress. That is not a fix. That is a potential health crisis for every  My Republican colleagues are well aware of this. Why else would they have drafted this bill and these last-minute changes in secret? Why else would complicated legislation affecting the lives of millions be sent to the floor just 2 weeks after it was introduced with no congressional hearings, not a single one, on a bill that impacts the health care of nearly every American family? Why else would they rush the bill to the floor without an updated Congressional Budget Office estimate of how much coverage and care will be lost by their backroom deal that ends consumer protections?  I get it. I wouldn't want to, nor would I know how to justify giving nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy paid for by threatening the health and well-being of millions of American families.  Who is getting these huge windfalls?  Companies like Amgen, with annual profits of more than $3 million; Medtronic, with annual profits of more than $6 billion; and Gilead Sciences, with $13 billion in profits in 2016 alone.  When the CBO released its report last week showing that 24 million hardworking Americans will be left without healthcare coverage by 2026 if we pass this bill, that premiums will rise 15 to 20 percent next year, that people will pay thousands of dollars more in deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, and that older Americans will be priced out of the market by an age tax, I thought for sure it was dead on arrival, that there was no way my Republican colleagues would walk this plank. But here they are, and they are trying to take millions of American families with them.  Fourteen million Americans will lose health coverage next year if this bill is approved. Twenty-one million Americans will lose coverage in the next 3 years alone, wiping out all of the coverage gains from the ACA in just 3 years. For pretty much everyone else in the individual market, deductibles and other costs will be higher. And for lower-income individuals, out-of-pocket costs will be much higher.  Insurance companies will again be able to sell plans that offer much less financial protection, and we will return to the days when millions of people in this country will live in fear that they are always one serious illness or accident away from bankruptcy.  This bill will result in the largest transfer of wealth from struggling families to the well-off in our Nation's history, giving $1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations. It is Robin Hood in reverse, but this is far worse because access to lifesaving care is being stolen.  I don't say that casually. I have met people, constituents of mine, whose lives have been saved because of the Affordable Care  This is from one of my constituents:  ``My name is Kevin I am 62 years old and I'm a lifelong resident of Louisville,  ``I worked hard, took risks and built a successful small business that I sold at age 59. My wife and I were excited about our prospects as we headed into early retirement. As a retiree too young for Medicare, I purchased health insurance on the open market. Less than a year later, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I have undergone multiple scans and 2 cycles of chemo. I am winning the battle so far, but since this disease is in my blood I will be fighting it for the rest of my life.[[Page H2407]]  ``A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event that not only attacks the body, but the mental stress is just as tough to deal with. Thanks to ObamaCare, I've been able to rest easier knowing that my illness wouldn't bankrupt my family and that I'll be able to provide for my wife even after I'm gone.''  I also heard from a young woman named Sarah She suffers from chronic kidney disease. Sarah was able to get health insurance because of the On January 9, 2011, it saved her life. One of her kidneys shut down and almost went septic. If she didn't have coverage, she would have waited or not gone to the hospital at all. The doctor told her that if she had arrived at the ER an hour later, she would have died.  Mr.Speaker, the health of my constituents Kevin Schweitzer and Sarah Adkins is at stake in this debate. They, and the hundreds of other constituents I have heard from who have serious and chronic health conditions, will need high-quality, affordable health coverage for the rest of their lives. Under this bill, they will get less coverage, it will cost more, and eventually they will be priced out of the market, leaving them nowhere to turn for the care they need.  And that is not all. Because of the last-minute changes to this bill, insurers will be able to sell stripped-down coverage to weed out people with preexisting conditions. They will be able to refuse, for example, to offer coverage for chemotherapy drugs and cancer treatments, insulin pumps, hospital stays, and prescription drugs that treat chronic conditions across the board. Basically, if you have a serious health problem, the care you need may not be available to you at all.  When the American people were promised by President Trump and Republican congressional leadership that their existing coverage would be preserved and that everybody would have insurance and it would be less expensive and much better, they, understandably, believed they would be treated much better than this. None of those promises are in this bill. In fact, the opposite of every one of those promises is what is in this bill. Those were promises made to every family in our congressional districts, and this bill fails them at every turn.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, in concluding the presentation from the Budget Committee, I just have to say that the bill we are considering today is a mess. It is not a healthcare bill at all.  This bill is driven by a desire to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and many wealthy corporations by nearly $1 trillion in all. It is paid for by making health care unaffordable for millions of people.  This is irresponsible. It is not what the American people want, it is not what they deserve, and it is certainly not what they can afford.  We are not the only ones opposing this legislation. It is opposed by an amazing array of American organizations and individuals, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the National Rural Health Association, AARP, the National Disability Rights Network, the American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society, and Easterseals, virtually every healthcare and consumer advocacy group, Governors from both sides of the aisle, and a growing list of our Republican colleagues.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the Budget Committee staff for the incredible job they have done throughout this process.

852,topic-id,192,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the loss of a Floridian, a patriot, and one of the Air Force's finest.  Two weeks ago, three servicemembers were lost in a crash of a reconnaissance and surveillance plane in New These young men were not just servicemembers serving in our United States Air Force; they were sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers.  In particular, Florida's own Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, a dedicated first lieutenant, had a long and promising career ahead of him. Lieutenant Dellecker was 26 and known amongst his friends for his legendary humor.  As a veterinarian, I was particularly touched by Lieutenant Dellecker's love of animals. His friends and family recently revealed that, while in pilot training, Lieutenant Dellecker once shared a hotdog with a flea-bitten stray who had just delivered a litter of puppies and was starving. He ended up taking her in and giving her a second chance at a new life.  I would like to take a moment on behalf of all Americans and all of the Members here today to thank him and his family for their service.  Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, your name will not be forgotten.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2549-4.txt,2115,HONORING LIEUTENANT FREDERICK DELLECKER,2017.0,29.0,March
