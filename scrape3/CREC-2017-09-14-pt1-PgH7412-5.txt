                HONORING CORPORAL FRANK LOUIS GARGUIOLO

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, with POW/MIA Recognition Day on 
September 15, I rise to honor Corporal Frank Louis Garguiolo, a veteran 
of, and prisoner of war during, the Second World War. He embodies the 
best of the Greatest Generation.
  The son of immigrants, Frank was born in 1923, the youngest of seven 
siblings. He grew up in Cheektowaga and attended Buffalo schools. 
Tragedy struck young, and Frank's father passed away when he was just 
12. Frank then went to work to support his mother and family.
  At 19, Frank enlisted in the United States Army, serving with the 3rd 
Infantry Division. His tour saw him through many major battles in North 
Africa and Europe. Corporal Garguiolo was captured by Axis forces and 
subjected to brutal forced labor for over half a year. Eventually, he 
was rescued by his brothers in arms from the 3rd Infantry Division.
  Today, at age 94, Frank is a fixture in his community and happily 
lives in the same house his father built.
  Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to bring our heroes home so 
they can live out their lives like Corporal Garguiolo has.
