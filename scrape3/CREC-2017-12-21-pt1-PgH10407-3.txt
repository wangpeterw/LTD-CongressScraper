                                TAX CUTS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in light of the passage of 
once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-generation tax relief for millions of 
middle-income families, including the vast majority in my district.
  Some, however, are not satisfied with cutting taxes for every income 
level and are unnerved at the thought of seeing more money in their own 
monthly paycheck.
  I am here to tell those people today that there is a very simple 
solution to their problem.
  As you can see here--outlined on page 92 of the IRS handbook, those 
individuals who feel right now that they are undertaxed and want to pay 
more of their income to the U.S. Government can do exactly that. When 
filing their income tax return, one can simply include a check payable 
to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.
  The best part is they can help pay down the debt without raising 
taxes on everyone else--America's hardworking families who deserve a 
tax break.
  So just a reminder, no one is stopping those who are feeling 
undertaxed from paying as much additional money to the government that 
they would like. I am sure Uncle Sam would appreciate the Christmas 
present.
  So don't complain about what your neighbor is paying. If you are 
feeling guilty about it, when you have the opportunity, feel free. Send 
it in.
