                    LEXIE HOLBROOK AND JAKE WAGONER

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to wish two very special 
constituents a happy birthday.
  Mrs. Lexie Holbrook and her great-great-great nephew, Mr. Jake 
Wagoner, of Wilkes County, recently celebrated their respective 
birthdays. Mrs. Holbrook observed her 110th birthday, and Jake enjoyed 
his 10th birthday.
  Mrs. Holbrook is the grande dame of North Wilkesboro and holds the 
title of the oldest living person in the county.
  While 100 years and 5 days may separate them in age, they share a 
strong bond. Jake is proud of Lexie's age, and he regards her 
experience as cool. Further, he believes her to be something of a 
celebrity. Jake reported to his fourth grade class about Lexie's 
upcoming birthday and exclaimed: ``That's right, she's mine.''
  The pride and love Mr. Wagoner feels for Lexie is inspiring. Mr. 
Speaker, I hope their story will serve to inspire others to strengthen 
the ties of friendship across generational lines--as we should all hope 
to have such bonds within our families.
