 RECOGNIZING CAMPBELLSVILLE UNIVERSITY LADY TIGERS WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
                                  TEAM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Comer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay special recognition to the 
Campbellsville University Lady Tigers women's basketball team upon 
making the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky proud with another 
successful college basketball season. The Lady Tigers finished with a 
28-7 record and appeared in their second NAIA Fab Four round in 3 
years.
  In their final four game in Billings, Montana, against Oklahoma City, 
two girls from my home county of Monroe had career highlights. Madison 
Clements hit six 3-pointers and Lauren Turner had nine assists. The 
Campbellsville University Lady Tigers are also coached by a Monroe 
County girl, Ginger High Colvin.
  The Campbellsville University Lady Tigers have been one of the most 
dominant college girls basketball programs in the NAIA over the past 20 
years. Campbellsville University is one of Kentucky's finest 
educational institutions, and I am very proud that Campbellsville is in 
the First Congressional District of Kentucky.
