                          ``WRONG'' CHOICE ACT

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this week the House considers the ``Wrong'' 
CHOICE Act, so I have one question for this body: Has this House 
completely forgotten how much pain the housing crisis that triggered 
the Great Recession has caused the American people?
  Eleven million people lost their homes; 8 million Americans lost 
their jobs; people lost their life savings--and that was not some sort 
of an accident of history. It was the effect of bad policy that allowed 
financial institutions to prey upon unwitting customers and take 
everything that they have worked for. That is what precipitated this 
crisis. It wasn't a storm. It was bad policy.
  And so what do we have? A bill that will take us right back to where 
we were, to the conditions that caused the financial crisis in the 
first place, and take the cop off the beat, essentially eliminating the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect people.
  We cannot do this. Let's reject this bill.
