                 WITH GUN RIGHTS COMES RESPONSIBILITIES

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to the victims and the 
families impacted by the horrific shooting in Las Vegas. Gun violence 
is a public health crisis that has claimed thousands of innocent lives, 
and we

must do everything we can to address it.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of being outraged, of 
sending thoughts and prayers, of seeing men, women, and children die 
because the gun lobby puts profit over people. That is not what our 
Founders intended by the right to bear arms.
  With rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to stop gun 
sales loopholes, to enact protections that make sure our kids and those 
with severe mental illnesses don't have access to guns, to address 
funding for mental health, and to oppose any efforts to make it easier 
to purchase silencers.
  Mr. Speaker, 87 percent of gunowners and 74 percent of NRA members 
support those commonsense solutions, like criminal background checks.
  I have a plea for gunowners across this country: urge the NRA to 
represent your views; show them that you mean business by speaking out 
or even terminating your NRA membership; show them that you care about 
your fellow Americans. Act now. Enough is enough.
