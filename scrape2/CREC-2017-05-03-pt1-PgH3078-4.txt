               HONORING THE MEMORY OF MATTHEW McCLANAHAN

  (Mr. HARPER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Matthew 
McClanahan.
  Matthew was a loving and devoted family man, a friend to so many, a 
respected employee who worked among our congressional community for the 
Office of the Architect of the Capitol. Born in Annapolis, Maryland, 
Matthew made his home in Glen Burnie, Maryland. As part of the 
maintenance division team of the Capitol Grounds, he was only 30 years 
young when he passed away.
  Respected by his colleagues and exemplifying hard work and dedication 
to his trade, he was known as being good-humored and someone always 
ready to lend a helping hand. Our entire congressional community mourns 
the loss of one of our own, following the terrible accident that took 
place last month on April 18.
  Later today, I will stand with my House colleagues in a moment of 
silence to honor and remember Matthew McClanahan. My entire staff and I 
join with the Architect of the Capitol team in offering his family, 
especially his wife, Lauren, and children, Evie and Matthew, our 
prayers and deepest sympathies.
