         REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION

  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 794, which 
will reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission until 2022, provide 
payments to the States to upgrade the security of voter registration 
databases, and require an assessment of each State's voting systems.
  Foreign hackers targeted the voter registration databases in more 
than 20 States in 2016. Candidate Trump encouraged hackers to target 
his opponent. He won the election and continues to cozy up to Russia.
  And now, House Republics are moving to eliminate the EAC, a key force 
in combating foreign cybersecurity attacks against our democracy.
  ``What do you have to lose?'' candidate Trump asked. Try free and 
fair elections, Mr. Speaker.
  I urge my Republic colleagues to put country before party and stand 
up for American democracy. Stop trying to suppress minority voters. 
Support an independent commission to investigate Russian meddling in 
our election.
