              OLIVIA, 7 YEARS OLD, WANTS TO PROTECT TREES

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a letter here from one of my 
grandkids, 7-year-old Olivia.
  ``January 28th.
  ``Dear Congressman Poe,
  ``I am writing to tell you that the environment is very important to 
me.
  ``We need to make sure that enough money is spent on keeping the 
world clene.
  ``I love seeing all the beauty in the world.
  ``I know that you agree with me that trees, flowers and lakes are 
worth protecting.
  ``I planted broccoli last year and I want every kid to have that 
opportunity at their school too.
  ``Please do your best!
  ``Sincerely, Olivia. #8, Dallas, Texas.''
  Mr. Speaker, No. 8 is my granddaughter Olivia. I call my 12 grandkids 
by their birth number.
  Well, Olivia, Mr. Cicilline and I are introducing legislation to 
protect trees on government easements of interstate highways.
  Sometimes trees are cleared at taxpayer expense so that billboards on 
adjacent property can be seen.
  Olivia is right, ``Trees are worth protecting.'' We should preserve 
the trees on the interstates because, as No. 8 says, ``The environment 
is important.''
  And that is just the way it is.
