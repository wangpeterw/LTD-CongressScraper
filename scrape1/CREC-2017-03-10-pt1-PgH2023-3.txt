                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, thank You for giving us another day.
  Be with each of us that we might be our very best, and prove 
ourselves worthy of Your love and Your grace. Bless our President and 
those who work in the executive branch and the Supreme Court with Your 
wisdom and good judgment.
  Be with the Members of this people's House in their work and 
deliberations this day that they might merit the trust of the American 
people and manifest the strength of our democracy to the nations of the 
world.
  Without You, O Lord, we can do nothing. With You and in You, we can 
establish a world of peace, goodness, and justice now and into the 
future.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.
