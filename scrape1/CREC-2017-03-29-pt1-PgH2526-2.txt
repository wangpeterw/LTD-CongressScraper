                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Robert Dillingham, Farina United Methodist Church, Farina, 
Illinois, offered the following prayer:
  Creator of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, we come to You as broken 
vessels, called to Your holy task of governance. Be with the families 
of these gathered, build up, equip, protect, and empower all to the 
task before them this day.
  Bring together through Your spirit those who are divided, and those 
who divide. Bring healing, bring unity, as You continually offer 
healing and hope to all of creation.
  Omnipresent Creator, You have guided creation through the most 
difficult times. You have called us to this time and to this place, to 
this activity, to this body. We have followed that calling.
  Now guide us, empower us, embolden us to this holy work of service 
and representation of Your creation. Guide us, O great Jehovah.
  Amen.
