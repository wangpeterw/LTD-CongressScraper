double the cost of tuition at the University of Rhode Island.
  Nationwide, the cost of child care has increased 25 percent in the 
past decade. That is a terrible deal. It is a raw deal for working 
families. Democrats have proposed the Child Care for Working Families 
Act, a better deal.
  This bill ensures that no middle class family will pay more than 7

workers. It focuses on the needs of middle class families and the high 
cost of child care.
  A few months ago, my Republican colleagues passed a huge tax cut for 
powerful corporate special interests and the wealthiest Americans. 
Democrats, on the other hand, are offering A Better Deal--a deal that 
focuses on raising family incomes, reducing costs in people's lives, 
and making sure people are prepared for jobs in the 21st century.
  We propose A Better Deal
