                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we are grateful for Your goodness. Your faithful love 
endures forever. We cannot list the miracles You have done throughout 
our lives and history.
  Lord, establish our lawmakers with Your might. When they go through 
dry and barren places, become for them a stream of water in life's 
desert. Demonstrate Your mighty wisdom as they seek to solve the 
daunting problems of our time. May Your promises never fail, as Your 
will is done on Earth even as it is done in Heaven.
  Eternal Spirit, You are the rock of our salvation, our help in ages 
past, and our hope for years to come.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
