           CONGRATULATING MONTCLAIR HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Montclair 
High School Mounties football team for winning their State championship 
game against the Union City Soaring Eagles.
  The Mounties' senior running back, Daniel Webb, returned the 
championship game's opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown only 13 
seconds after the game began. The Mounties never lost their lead. They 
beat Union City 35-14 and won New Jersey's North 1, Group 5 State 
championship. This was Montclair's third perfect season and fourth 
State championship in the past 6 years.
  The championship is a big win for everyone in Montclair, New Jersey. 
For weeks, local businesses and community groups came together to 
support the Mounties. At the championship game, on December 1, more 
than 1,500 fans turned out to cheer their team on.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating head coach John 
Fiore and the Montclair Mounties football team for their big win in a 
stellar year.
