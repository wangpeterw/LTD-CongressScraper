                     WHEN WILL CONGRESS FINALLY ACT

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, CNN reported that the Pentagon 
is considering a proposal to send U.S. ground troops to northern Syria. 
This is for a report to President Trump on the war against ISIS due 
this month.
  But the very idea that the Pentagon is seriously considering sending 
more troops into Syria should be a wake-up call to Congress and to all 
Americans. Three years after the U.S. first sent troops to Syria and 
Iraq, Congress still hasn't voted to authorize the fight against ISIS.
  Do we really want to send more Americans into war? What is the 
mission? How does it end?
  For 3 years, Congress has failed to do its constitutional duty. Three 
years of cowardice. Three years of a blank check.
  Speaker Ryan promised action in 2016, but did nothing.
  When, Mr. Speaker, will this House finally do its job? After 100 more 
American troops are sent to Syria and Iraq? Five hundred more? A 
thousand? When will Congress finally act?
  Mr. Speaker, I say the time is now.
