 SENATE RESOLUTION 121--DESIGNATING APRIL 11, 2017, AS THE ``NATIONAL 
              BIRTHDAY OF THE U.S. NAVY SUBMARINE FORCE''

  Mr. MURPHY (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 121

       Whereas, for 117 years, the broad strategic and tactical 
     advantages created by the submarine force of the Navy 
     (referred to in this preamble as the ``Submarine Force'') 
     have enhanced the national security of the United States 
     through undersea missions;
       Whereas, over the course of the last 11 decades, the 
     submarines of the Navy have advanced through 4 generations;
       Whereas the Navy first acquired a commissioned submarine, 
     the USS Holland (SS-1), on April 11, 1900;
       Whereas the first generation submarines of the Navy rapidly 
     evolved from small, limited-capability submersibles to a 
     dominant force in naval warfare;
       Whereas the second generation submarines of the Navy, 
     defined by the heroes of World War II, made a decisive 
     difference in a war in which control of the sea was crucial;
       Whereas the third generation submarines of the Navy, 
     defined by the Cold War and the use nuclear power, helped 
     prevent a nuclear world war and secured the interests of the 
     United States;
       Whereas the modern, fourth generation submarines of the 
     Navy use long-range sensors and weapons to stay ahead of 
     global threats and preserve freedom of navigation in the 
     global maritime environment;
       Whereas, in 2017, the Submarine Force consists of 52 
     attack, 14 ballistic missile, and 4 guided missile submarines 
     that enable the Navy to win wars, prevent conflicts, and 
     defeat threats posed by terrorists;
       Whereas, throughout the history of the Submarine Force, the 
     1 constant has been the tremendous character, courage, and 
     dedication of the men and women who maintain, equip, and 
     train and fight in the submarines of the Navy; and
       Whereas April 11, 2017, marks the 117th birthday of the 
     Submarine Force and is an appropriate date to designate as 
     the ``National Birthday of the U.S. Navy Submarine Force'': 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates April 11, 2017, as the ``National Birthday 
     of the U.S. Navy Submarine Force''; and
       (2) acknowledges the critical role that the men and women 
     of the submarine force of the Navy fulfill in defending the 
     United States.
