                 WELCOMING CHAPLAIN MICHAEL J. HALYARD

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Rutherford) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my colleagues 
to our guest chaplain for the U.S. House of Representatives, Reverend 
Captain Michael Halyard of Jacksonville, Florida--previously of 
Jacksonville, Florida, I should say. Upon his return from Iraq just 
recently, he has been deployed to San Antonio, Texas, and that is a 
loss for northeast Florida.
  Reverend Halyard is a respected community leader who is devoted to 
his community, country, family, and faith. Reverend Halyard serves as a 
staff chaplain at Community Hospice of Northeast Florida, and he served 
as an assistant pastor at the United Missionary Baptist Church in 
Jacksonville. He is also a member of the Florida National Guard, where 
he has served as the combat veteran battalion chaplain since 2009.
  Reverend Halyard leads his church and his community by serving his 
Nation, leading worship services, and by providing support for grieving 
families.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to welcome Reverend Halyard. 
May God bless him and our Nation, and especially those who he will be 
serving in Texas, particularly Sutherland Springs, Texas, today.
