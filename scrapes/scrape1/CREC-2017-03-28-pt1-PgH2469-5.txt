                       REMEMBERING JOHN CRUTCHER

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mourn the loss of John 
Crutcher, who passed away on March 12, 2017, at the age of 100.
  A native of Kansas, John spent many years in public service, 
including teaching in a one-room school on the prairie. He was elected 
to a seat in the Kansas Senate and served two terms as Lieutenant 
Governor in his home State. In 1982, President Reagan appointed him to 
the Federal Postal Rate Commission, where he gained a reputation as an 
outspoken critic of the Postal Service.
  In World War II he served as a Navy officer in the Pacific theater 
and Korea. He retired as a captain in the U.S. Naval Reserve and always 
remained active in Navy organizations.
  A true, very modest gentleman, John was respected and beloved by all 
who knew him. He will be greatly missed in the mountains of North 
Carolina, which he came to call home after marrying his lovely wife, 
Edith.
