         amended

                           Annex Item No vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The Radio Frequency (RF) TOW 2A Missile (BGM-71E-4B-RF) 
     is a direct-attack missile designed to defeat armored 
     vehicles, reinforced urban structures, field fortifications 
     and other such targets. TOW missiles are fired from a variety 
     of TOW launchers used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, 
     and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The TOW 2A RF 
     missile can be launched from the same launcher platforms as 
     the existing wire-guided TOW 2A missile without modification 
     to the launcher. The TOW 2A missile (both wire & RF) contains 
     two tracker beacons for the launcher to track and guide the 
     missile in flight. Guidance commands from the launcher are 
     provided to the missile by a RF link contained within the 
     missile case. The hardware, software, and technical 
     publications to be provided with the sale are UNCLASSIFIED. 
     The highest level of classified information authorized for 
     released through the sale of the TOW 2A is SECRET.
       2. The RF TOW 2B Aero Missile (BGM-71 F-3-RF) is a fly-
     over-shoot-down missile designed to defeat armored vehicles. 
     TOW missiles are fired from a variety of TOW Launchers in the 
     inventories of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, and 
     Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The TOW 2B Aero RF 
     missile can be launched from the same launcher platforms as 
     wire-guided TOW 2B and TOW 2B Aero missiles without 
     modification to the launcher. The TOW 2B missile (both wire-
     guided & RF) contains two tracker beacons for the launcher to 
     track and guide the missile in flight. Guidance commands from 
     the launcher are provided to the missile by an RF link 
     contained within the missile case. The hardware and technical 
     publications to be provided with the sale are UNCLASSIFIED. 
     Software algorithms for the system are classified SECRET. The 
     highest level of classified information released through the 
     sale of the TOW 2B is SECRET.
       3. The RF TOW Bunker Buster (BB), BGM-71-Fl-RF is a variant 
     of the TOW 2A that replaces the TOW 2A warhead with a high 
     explosive blast-fragmentation warhead. This bulk charge 
     warhead is effective against reinforced concrete walls, light 
     armored vehicles, and earth and timber bunkers. Guidance 
     commands from the launcher are provided to the missile by an 
     RF link contained within the missile case. The hardware, 
     software, and technical publications to be provided with the 
     sale are UNCLASSIFIED. The highest level of classified 
     information released through the sale of the TOW 2B is 
     SECRET.
       4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of 
     these variants, the information could be used to develop 
     countermeasures that might reduce weapon system effectiveness 
     or be used in the development of a system with similar or 
     advanced capabilities.
       5. A determination has been made by the U.S. Government 
     that the Government of Bahrain can provide the same degree of 
     protection for the sensitive technology being released as the 
     U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the 
     U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined 
     in the Policy Justification.
       6. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     the Government of Bahrain.

     modified HGU-55/P helmet that incorporates a visor-projected 
     Heads-Up Display (HUD) to cue weapons and aircraft sensors to 
     air and ground targets. In close combat, a pilot must 
     currently align the aircraft to shoot at a target. JHMCS 
     allows the pilot to simply look at a target to shoot. This 
     system projects visual targeting and aircraft performance 
     information on the back of the helmet's visor, enabling the 
     pilot to monitor this information without interrupting his 
     field of view through the cockpit canopy. The system uses a 
     magnetic transmitter unit fixed to the pilot's seat and a 
     magnetic field probe mounted on the helmet to define helmet 
     pointing positioning. A Helmet Vehicle Interface (HVI) 
     interacts with the aircraft system bus to provide signal 
     generation for the helmet display. This provides significant 
     improvement for close combat targeting and engagement.
