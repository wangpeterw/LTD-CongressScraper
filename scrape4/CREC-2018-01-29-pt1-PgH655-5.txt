                   HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHNNY NELSON

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, last week, God called home a true icon of 
Katy, Texas: Johnny Nelson.
  Katy was a little rice farming town when I moved there in 1972, to 
southeast Texas. It was forever changed by Johnny. He served as our 
mayor from 1983 to 1987, and as our senior administrator from 1994 to 
2014. Those were glorious years for Katy, Texas.

  He was the force behind the Katy Mills Mall and the Katy Heritage 
Museum. A true Texan, Johnny was a rice farmer and a cattleman, and we 
all loved his trademark cigar and cowboy hat.
  Mr. Speaker, I will close by paraphrasing another Texas icon, Bum 
Phillips, the coach of the Houston Oilers, who said: ``Johnny Nelson 
may not be in a class by himself, but whatever class he's in, it don't 
take long to call the roll.''
  Thank you, Johnny. Welcome home.
