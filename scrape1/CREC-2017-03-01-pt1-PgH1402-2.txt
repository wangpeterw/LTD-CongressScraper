                         ANTIOCH BAPTIST CHURCH

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Antioch 
Baptist Church in Robeson County, North Carolina.
  This year, Antioch Baptist celebrates their 200th anniversary. What 
an incredible testimony of faithfully spreading God's Word and 
ministering to the community.
  In 1817, the church was founded in the swamps of Robeson County as 
Burnt Island Baptist, with meetings under a brush arbor on the same 
spot where the church meets today.
  In 1842, the church was renamed Antioch, after the city from which 
the Apostle Paul launched his three missionary journeys. The name was 
chosen to signify the church's commitment to missions.
  More recently, Antioch Baptist took on the mission of providing a 
solid education alternative for the people of Robeson County by opening 
Antioch Christian Academy.
  Later this year, I look forward to joining Pastor Mark Meadows and 
the congregation of Antioch Baptist Church to celebrate their 200th 
anniversary.
  God bless them.
