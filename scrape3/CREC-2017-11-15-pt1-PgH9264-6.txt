                       WELCOMING DR. GLYNN STONE

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Gohmert) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy that I welcome Dr. 
Glynn Stone to the House of Representatives today to serve as our guest 
chaplain.
  Dr. Stone serves at Mobberly Baptist Church in Longview as senior 
pastor, where he takes part in influencing others for Christ. He is 
husband to wife, Angie, and together, they have the joy of raising 
three awesome sons.
  Dr. Stone's call to ministry began when he was 16 years old, serving 
in churches throughout the Tennessee Valley. Under Dr. Stone's 
influence at Mobberly Baptist, several churches have been planted 
across the country as well as numerous mission trips across the world.
  Apart from his pastoral services, Dr. Stone has had the privilege of 
teaching at several colleges and universities, including Southwestern 
Seminary, Dallas Baptist University, and Shorter College.
  Knowing Dr. Stone as a friend and as a confidant is an honor and a 
privilege. His dedication to the church of Jesus Christ is something to 
be greatly admired, just as the vast number of our Founders did. He is 
a blessing to the multitude of people whom God has touched through him 
and his years of service to our Lord.
