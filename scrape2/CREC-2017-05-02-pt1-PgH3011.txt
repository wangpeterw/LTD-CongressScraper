                     TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JOHN JACOBSON

  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a true 
American hero, a dedicated veteran, and a successful businessman.
  Major John Jacobson enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1940 and fought in 
World War II, where he served as quartermaster to General George 
Patton.
  After his military career, he moved to Kansas and built a Fortune 500 
company and became a leader in the meat-packing industry.
  After retiring and moving to coastal Alabama in 1999, Major Jacobson 
became a local celebrity. Mr. Jack, as he was affectionately known, 
spent much of his time working with local veterans organizations where 
he would speak with school groups about World War II and the sacrifice 
our veterans make.
  Sadly, he recently passed away at the age of 106, making him one of 
the country's oldest World War II veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, all you need to know about Major Jacobson is that he 
lived his life by a simple motto: Another day to live is another day to 
serve.
  To his family, thank you for sharing Mr. Jack with all of us. He made 
our community, the United States, and the world a better place.
