  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because of what we saw 
happening this weekend.
  President Trump's executive order is unconstitutional, un-American, 
and unlawful. I myself went to Los Angeles International Airport on 
Saturday night, and what I saw was shocking to me. I saw Fatema coming 
in from an airline--a legal, permanent resident in this country, who 
came with her 1-year-old son who is an American citizen--being detained 
with the threat of being deported and pressured to sign to give up her 
right to be a legal permanent resident.
  I was fighting to get to her, to make sure she had legal counsel, to 
make sure that she had that opportunity, and I was unsuccessful. 
Despite me and another Member being there, the Customs and Border 
Protection wouldn't even talk to us. They wouldn't give us a briefing. 
They merely hung up on us.
  Mr. Speaker, this is wrong. This provision is discriminatory based on 
religion and nationality. This did not only affect a small number of 
travelers; this affected families; this affected lawyers and volunteers 
who came out in the masses. I hope the President will see.
  I will work to ensure the Federal Government obeys the Constitution, 
respects our history as a nation of immigrants, and does not unlawfully 
target anyone because of their national origin or faith.
