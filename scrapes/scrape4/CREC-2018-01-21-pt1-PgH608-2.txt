                      LET'S END THE TRUMP SHUTDOWN

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, well, it is day two of the Trump 
shutdown, the first government shutdown in history when one party has 
control of the House, the Senate, and the White House. But I believe 
that the issues at the heart of this debate actually have support from 
a majority of Americans and a majority in Congress. So I ask my 
Republican colleagues:
  Who are the 218 Republicans who would vote against funding community 
health centers as well as the Children Health Insurance Program?
  Who are the 218 Republicans who oppose addressing veterans' programs, 
workers' pensions, and the opioid epidemic?
  And, yes, who are the 218 Republicans who would vote against the 
young DACA recipients and the Dream Act?
  We don't lack votes. We lack willingness from President Trump and 
Republican leadership to negotiate.
  I am here. We are here ready to work. The Democrats want to come 
together with the Republicans on a bipartisan deal to end the Trump 
shutdown.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End 
the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution that would 
immediately reopen the government through Tuesday while negotiations 
continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parity and on other 
critical issues.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair has previously advised, that 
request cannot be entertained absent appropriate clearance.
