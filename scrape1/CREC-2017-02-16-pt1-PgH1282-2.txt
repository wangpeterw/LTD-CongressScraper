               COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF TIM PRENDIVILLE

  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Tim 
Prendiville, an active member of Tucson's Irish community and dear 
friend of my family and mine who sadly passed away on February 14.
  Tim dedicated his life to giving back to others. For example, he 
organized meals and bought sleeping bags for the homeless at Armory 
Park, and he donated his time to help those who could not read or write 
send letters to their loved ones.
  He was a founding member of Tucson's St. Patrick's Day committee and 
was honored last year as grand marshal of the annual parade.
  He was a gifted storyteller, a reflection of his Irish roots. One of 
his favorites was the time he sang ``Oh Danny Boy'' at a dinner with 
then-Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy.
  I've known Tim ever since I was a young child. When I was 12, he 
delivered the eulogy at my father's funeral. Throughout my life, he has 
been a constant source of encouragement, and, although we belonged to 
different political parties, he was somebody who shared widely his 
faith and belief in me.
  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply grateful for Tim Prendiville's love and 
support. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and loved ones in 
our time of grief. I know he is now singing ``Oh Danny Boy'' with the 
angels.
