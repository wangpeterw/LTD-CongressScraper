         BRING AMERICA TO 100 PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2050

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, to quote Ronald Reagan: ``Preservation of 
our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge; it's common 
sense.'' Yet, this week, my Republican colleagues continued the trend 
of pushing through bills that deeply undermine critical environmental 
protections.
  H.R. 806, the ``Smoggy Skies Act,'' is an attack on the Clean Air Act 
that will lift protections against harmful pollutants that put the 
health of our communities at risk. Republicans also made it clear that 
they are prioritizing dangerous pipelines while shirking environmental 
review processes.
  But despite their efforts, we are looking ahead and putting forward a 
bold vision for protecting our environment and our economic future. I 
am proud to introduce, with Congressmen Polis, Grijalva, and Huffman, 
the 100 by `50 Act, which aims to bring the United States to 100 
percent renewable energy by 2050.
  Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, our economy, our 
children, and our communities, and our bill lays out a bold roadmap for 
ensuring that we transition to a clean and renewable energy economy 
while prioritizing good jobs for workers and investments in our 
communities.
  This is the time to be bold.
