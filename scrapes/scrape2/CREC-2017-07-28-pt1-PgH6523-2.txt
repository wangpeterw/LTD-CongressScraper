                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Scott Poling, Harvest New Beginnings Church, Oswego, Illinois, 
offered the following prayer:
  Lord, I pray for these who serve this Nation, for they ultimately 
serve You. There is no authority except from God, and these gathered 
here, whether they realize it or not, are Your ministers for the good 
of the people of the United States of America.
  I pray for the men and women in this room and those who will soon 
fill these seats. Help them to acknowledge You, come to faith in You, 
look to You, and live in the fear of God and not the fear of men. 
Embolden them to make good godly decisions that You deem right, based 
on the authority of Your holy inspired word.
  I especially pray for the many Representatives who are Your true 
children by faith in Jesus Christ. Grant them Your favor and blessing 
and raise them up. Give them supernatural strength through the work 
that they do. Give them great wisdom for the decisions they make and 
the direction in which they lead this Nation.
  God, purify their motives, protect them from pride, help them bow, 
lest they break, and may they never forget Your promise: ``He who 
honors Me, I will honor.''
  In Jesus' name, the only name by which we have access to Heaven, I 
pray.
  Amen.
