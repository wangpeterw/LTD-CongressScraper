                         SENATE HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the healthcare bill 
that has emerged from secret Republican-only negotiations in the other 
body.
  Mr. Speaker, 900,000 people--nearly 1 million--gained health 
insurance just in Ohio through the Affordable Care Act. But this 
lopsided Republican bill is even more cruel than their House version. 
It will rip away care from millions, including very sick people who are 
suffering from mental illness and opioid addiction.
  We all know amazing families, many of whom have come to our offices 
telling their stories, families who care for the sick and for those who 
will never be able to realize the dreams due to illness and disability. 
To put them on the chopping block is un-American and it is anti-life.
  The Republican bill slashes Medicaid, which is a lifeline to working 
people, and puts more crushing costs on millions of seniors dependent 
on Medicaid for nursing home care.
  The Republican bill is anti-life. The Republican proposal makes 
healthcare unaffordable for many Americans, and basically gives a tax 
cut to those who make millions and billions of dollars. How cruel is 
that?
  Caring for the most dependent and ill among us cannot be left to 
chance. Americans should rise up in protest from coast to coast and 
oppose this anti-life Republican bill.
