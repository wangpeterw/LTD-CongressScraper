9552,topic-id,436,"Mr.Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for coming out and speaking out.  I rise today to express concern and strong opposition to President-elect Trump Cabinet nominations for Attorney General, Secretary of Education,[[Page H226]]and Secretary of Health and Human President-elect Trump chose not to practice what he preached, and he didn't drain the swamp. Instead, he nominated politically divisive individuals to serve in his administration.  Throughout a public service career spanning more than 30 years, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders. He allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK, and then tried to dismiss it as a joke. He celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act and opposed same-sex marriage. He denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade and voted against greater access to health care for veterans. He blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women He does not respect the rights of minorities or women, and he has proven himself to be unfit to serve as United States Attorney  Education is the great equalizer. One of the most important investments families make is in their children. The Secretary of Education must be committed to providing a free, world-class education to all students regardless of race, gender, ability, status, financial means, or geography.  Unfortunately, Betsy DeVos has consistently fought for private school vouchers that divert funds from public schools, our communities, and our children who need these investments the most. She has even used her personal wealth to lobby against important transparency and accountability measures that would have provided necessary safeguards for Michigan students.  DeVos' track record of undermining public education and her lack of commitment to defending the civil rights of students causes me great pause in her quest to become Secretary of I can't support it. Betsy DeVos, absolutely no.  Finally, Chairman He has made it clear that his budget priorities are highly partisan. We can expect that if he is confirmed, he will strip 20 million people of affordable health care, women would be denied their right to contraception and reproductive health care, and devastating cuts would be levied against Medicaid funding. We can't go back to a time when being a woman is a preexisting condition for insurance coverage. Chairman Price's nomination offers just that.  These folks will not unite the American people, and they cannot be trusted to advocate for our most vulnerable populations, so I urge my Senate colleagues to oppose the confirmations of Senator Jeff Sessions, Betsy DeVos, and Chairman Tom  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgH220-6.txt,2201,SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL,2017.0,9.0,April
9568,topic-id,663,"Madam President, with this vote, the Senate will move early next week to confirm the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the U.Education In my judgment, she will be an excellent and important Education Secretary for this country.  The 1 job of the U.Education Secretary is to help create an environment in which our 100,000 public schools succeed, because that is where 9 out of 10 of our children go.  When I was Education Secretary for President George H.Bush in the early 1990s, I had the privilege of working with a man named David Kerns, who had been the chief executive officer of the Xerox He came in as the Deputy Education Secretary at a time when he was not only one of the country's leading businessmen, but he was also the leading businessman who tried to help change public education. David Kern's belief was that it was very difficult to help children by changing public education if you try to do it from within. As all of us do, he respected the teachers, the parents, and the students who work within the public education system, but over the last 30 years, as this country has worked to try to improve our public schools, much of that energy has come from outside the public school establishment. Among those were the Governors of the country.  In the mid-1980s, all of the Governors met together--in 1985 and 1986--on one subject for a whole year. The purpose was, how can we help improve our public schools? I was chairman of the National Governors Association that year, Bill Clinton was the vice chairman, and we did that in a bipartisan way. We did that from outside the schools. Since that time, many Governors and many business leaders have worked hard in support of our public schools, trying to help them have even better opportunities for our children. Among those has been Betsy The Governors I spoke of are Governors who are familiar names in this country. I think of Jeb Bush, John Engler of Michigan, Mitt Romney, and the work they did in their respective States to make their public schools better and to create other opportunities for children. All of the three Governors I mentioned--Bush, Romney, and Engler--support Betsy  As chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, there are 22 Governors who have written letters to me supporting Betsy They see her as someone from outside the system of public education who, as they worked for 30 years, can help change and improve it.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my remarks the names of the 22 Governors who support her. They come from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and  The Governors of all those States support Betsy Four of the last Education Secretaries support Betsy Bill Bennett, Rod Paige, Margaret Spellings, and I support her. Joe Lieberman, who served in this body and worked on the DC voucher program for many years, endorsed her. She has strong support from the Governors who for 30 years have been working hard to successfully improve our public schools.  Some have said: Well, she has spent her time working on giving children choices of schools other than public schools.  She has done that, and it has always puzzled me as to why anybody would criticize that. The idea that a low-income child should have the same opportunity or more of the same opportunities as a wealthy family has would seem to me to be a very all-American idea. Not only does it seem to be, it is an idea that underlies the most successful piece of social policy our country has ever enacted, arguably--the GI[[Page S665]]bill for veterans in 1944. Think about that. The veterans came home from World War We gave them a scholarship. It followed them to the college of their choice.

9673,topic-id,1565,"Mr.President, we are engaged in the first step to debate what is important to virtually every What we want to do is to find good ways to reform and replace ObamaCare and then repeal the provisions of it that have damaged so many  Before we start talking about a big subject, sometimes it helps to ask the question: Exactly what are we talking about? So, very quickly, where do Americans get our health care insurance? It might be interesting to note that 91 percent of us have some sort of health insurance--290 million. We get it from four places, basically. One is Medicare--18 percent of us with insurance. This is not a bill to change That is a discussion for another day. So we are talking about these three areas.  One is employers, on the job. Sixty-one percent of us with insurance get it on the job--178 million people.  Medicaid, managed by States, paid for by the Federal and State governments--22 percent of covered Americans there get their insurance through  Then there is the individual market, people who buy it on their own. That includes the exchanges we hear so much about. Here is where all the news is; here is where the turmoil is. That is just 6 percent of everyone who is insured, although that is 18 million This is information from the U. Who is not insured? That is interesting too. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 27 million people who aren't insured, but 17 million of those are eligible for some help to get insurance and just haven't taken it. Of the 11 million who are not eligible for any help, nearly half of them--5 million--are illegally here. Of the rest, some make too much money to be eligible for assistance, and some dropped through the Medicaid coverage gap. So it is fair to say that 91 percent of us are insured one way or the other. Then, of the 27 million--the 9 percent who are not insured--17 million of those are eligible for some sort of assistance.  How should we approach this? Following the Presidential election, President-Elect Donald Trump said on ``60 Minutes'' that replacement and repeal of ObamaCare would be done ``simultaneously.'' To me, that means at the same time.  Just today, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that repeal and replacement of ObamaCare would be done concurrently. To me, simultaneously and concurrently mean ObamaCare should finally be repealed only when there are concrete practical reforms in place--that give Americans access to truly affordable health care. Let me say that again: ObamaCare should be repealed, finally, only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place that give Americans access to truly affordable health care.  The American people deserve health care reform that is done in the right way for the right reasons and in the right amount of time. It is not about developing a quick fix. It is about working toward a long-term recovery that works for everyone.  Here is one way to think about what simultaneously or concurrently might mean. I would ask you to think about ObamaCare as if it were a local bridge in, say, South Dakota that is collapsing--because that is just what is happening with According to the Tennessee Insurance Commission, the ObamaCare insurance market in our State is ``very near collapse.'' Across the country, premiums and copays are up. Employers have cut jobs to afford ObamaCare costs. Medicaid mandates are consuming State budgets. In one-third of America's counties, citizens with Federal subsidies have only a single choice of a company to buy insurance from on an ObamaCare exchange. Without quick action this year, next year, these Americans may have zero choices. Their subsidies may be worth about as much as a bus ticket in a town where no buses run.  If your local bridge in South Dakota or Wyoming or Tennessee were very near collapse, what would you do? I think the first thing you do is to send in a rescue crew to repair it temporarily so no one else is hurt. Then you start building a better bridge--or more accurately, many bridges--as States develop their own plans for providing truly affordable health care to replace the old bridge.  Finally, when the new bridges are finished, you close the old bridge. That is how we propose to proceed: to rescue those trapped in a failing system that is ObamaCare, to replace that system with a functional market or markets, and then repeal ObamaCare for good.  First, we will offer a rescue plan so that the 11 million Americans who buy insurance now on the exchanges can continue to do so while we build a better set of concrete, practical alternatives.  Second, we will build the better systems. Note that I say systems, not one system. If anyone is expecting Senator McConnell to roll a wheelbarrow onto the Senate floor with a great big comprehensive Republican health care plan, they are going to be waiting a long time because we don't believe in that. We don't want to replace a failed ObamaCare Federal system with another failed Federal system.  We want to create many systems across this country, step-by-step, to give Americans more choices of insurance that cost less. We will do this by moving more health care decisions out of Washington and into the hands of State and patients and by reducing harmful taxes. We will do it carefully, step-by-step, so that it is effective.  Finally, we will repeal what remains of the law that did all of this damage and created all of this risk. That is what we will do.[[Page S196]]  Here is what we will not do. This is not a bill for Medicare reform. That will be handled separately.  Second, you won't be disqualified from getting insurance if you have a preexisting health condition. If you are under the age of 26, you will still be able to be covered under your parents' plan.  That is what, in my opinion, we mean by repeal and replace ``simultaneously,'' as the President-elect said, or ``concurrently,'' as Speaker Ryan said.  Here are three steps we will take beginning immediately. 1 is the rescue plan. Six percent of Americans with insurance buy their insurance in this individual market, about two-thirds of those on the ObamaCare exchanges. This is where today's turmoil is. This is where the copays are up, the premiums are up, where insurance companies are pulling out of the markets.  While we build replacements, we want the 11 million Americans who now buy insurance on the exchanges to be able to continue to buy private insurance. This will require Congress and the President to take action before March 1, which is when the insurance companies begin to decide whether they will offer insurance in these markets during 2018.  In general, the goal is to get as close as possible to allowing any State-approved plan to count as health insurance under ObamaCare rules while we are transitioning to new systems. Among the actions that will help are to allow individuals to use their ObamaCare subsidies to purchase State-approved insurance outside the ObamaCare exchanges; to adjust ObamaCare's special enrollment periods; to approve the temporary continuation of cost-sharing subsidies for deductibles and copays; to allow States more flexibility to determine so-called essential health benefits, age rating rules, and small group restrictions; to expand health savings accounts; eventually, to provide tax credits to help lower-income Americans buy insurance; and to repeal the individual mandate when new insurance market rules are in place.  When the new administration rewrites the guidance on ObamaCare section 1332 State innovation waivers to allow for more State flexibility, States will have the authority to further innovate to build more modern health systems.  Now, second is employer insurance. Remember, that is where 61 percent of us get our insurance--on the job. We will repair the damage ObamaCare has done so that employers can offer employees more personalized patient-centered care. We will do that by repealing ObamaCare's employer mandate penalty. We will allow States to determine the so-called essential health benefits and thereby lower costs for small businesses. We will repeal ObamaCare's restrictions on grandfathered health plans, on wellness benefits, on small group plans, and provide more flexibility for small businesses so they can work together to buy insurance--a proposal for which the Senator from Wyoming has championed for years.  This will mean more State authority, more choices, and lower costs for the 178 million Americans who obtain insurance on the job.  Third is Twenty-two percent of all insured Americans are covered by We will give States more flexibility to offer those 62 million citizens more options by making Federal Medicaid waivers more flexible.  So in summary, we will first send in a rescue crew to repair temporarily a collapsing health care market so no one else is hurt. Second, step-by-step, we will build better systems--that give Americans access to truly affordable health care. We will do this by moving health care decisions out of Washington, DC, and back to States and patients.  Finally, when our reforms become concrete practical alternatives, we will repeal the remaining parts of ObamaCare in order to repair the damage it has caused This is what I believe we mean when we say ObamaCare should be repealed and replaced simultaneously and concurrently.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Rounds). The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS187-2.txt,1695,IMPACT OF CABINET NOMINATIONS,2017.0,10.0,January
9675,topic-id,813,"Mr.President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, who has spent a great deal of time on this. I like the way he put that because I think what we want to assure people of--at least, I think that is what almost all of us feel--is that this is step 1. It involves reforms, replacing, and repealing--as the President-elect has said, ``simultaneously,'' and as the Speaker has said, ``concurrently.'' It involves not just one big system replaced by another big system. In our view, the one big system needs to be replaced step-by-step by many different systems as we move more decisions to the  For example, on employer insurance, or people who get their insurance on the job, we know right now steps that we can take to repeal ObamaCare, which damaged the employer system and which increased costs for employers. I remember sitting around with a group of restaurant company chief executive officers 6 years ago when ObamaCare passed. They pointed out that they were going have to hire fewer people to afford the cost of  We don't want that to happen. We would like for them to be able to hire more people and to offer more people insurance. How would we do that? Well, if we repeal the Washington rules in an orderly way and transfer back to the States responsibility for regulating most insurance, the insurance commissioners have told us they believe they can do that very well--do it one way in South Dakota, another way in Tennessee, another way in Wyoming, and fit the needs of that community, reduce costs, increase choices, and have truly affordable health care.  So we can repeal those provisions that interfere with employer insurance and make sure that that repeal does not go into effect until South Dakota, Wyoming, Tennessee, and other parts of the market have in place concrete practical alternatives so they go together. But we have to get started. This is step 1.  Now, we can do the same with We have a former Governor of South Dakota in the Governors spend most of their time trying to figure out how to afford They almost feel that, if Washington would just allow the States to have more[[Page S197]]flexibility in terms of how the available money is spent, we could cover more people better, offer more options.  Well, we can do that. But we are not going to do that tomorrow. We will have to sit down with the Governors and say: How do you suggest we do this? Then, as we do that, we can repeal the extensive Federal regulation that creates a jungle of redtape for But it only would take effect as the States tell us that there are concrete practical alternatives in effect. So this is the step-by-step way to go about making those kind of changes.  Finally, as the Senator said, we have to have a rescue team here. I mean, the ObamaCare market is in turmoil. It is only 6 percent of all of those who have insurance, but that is millions of people. If we don't act before March 1 to make sure insurance companies are selling into those markets, we will have many millions of people who will not be able to buy insurance. This will be, as I said, like having a bus ticket in a hometown with no buses running.  So that is really one of the first things we have to do--get that rescue team going. I like the analogy of the collapsing bridge. ObamaCare is collapsing in Tennessee, and I would say it is around the country, if you have one-third of the counties where you can only choose insurance from one company.  So, if a bridge is collapsing, you send in a crew to deal with that emergency so no one else is hurt. Then you start building these new bridges. After a while, in a prudent way, as you build each of those systems, as States build their systems, then you close that old broken-down bridge that was damaging so many people.  So that is an orderly way to go about things. I hope that, over time, we will have bipartisan support for these. We need a consensus. We don't, in the end, want to have just a partisan bill. But we have been acting like the Hatfields and McCoys in West Virginia for 6 years, arguing with each other about ObamaCare--Republicans and  So it may take a little while to get there. But we can start, and we are starting under the leadership of Senator Then, we will move concurrently and simultaneously to reform, replace, and repeal ObamaCare so that Americans have access to truly affordable insurance. By the time we get to that, I am hopeful that we will begin to have a consensus within this body that involves Democrats and Republicans both.

9640,topic-id,706,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen our Nation's nuclear energy capacity. It is called the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization I am a strong supporter of American nuclear energy. It is a vital component of our ``all of the above'' American energy plan. My home State of Wyoming plays a key role in American nuclear energy supply. In Wyoming, we produce more uranium than any other  Nuclear energy is clean, safe, reliable, and affordable. It also provides a major boost to the economy. American nuclear plants provide thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in benefits to local communities. U.nuclear powerplants have run safely for decades, and many of them will serve our country for years and decades to come. But after decades of reliable power from our traditional nuclear powerplants, these nuclear powerplants are experiencing innovation with opportunities that are now taking shape in the nuclear industry. Increased private investment is occurring in nuclear energy, and it has led to improvements in safety, security, and in cost.  This is no longer a traditional nuclear industry. There are nuclear startups which are being backed by American entrepreneurs. Research and work are being done by Bill Gates, of all people. These folks envision fundamentally transforming nuclear energy technology. I believe the advances are exciting. The biggest challenges these innovators face, however, are the costs and delays from regulatory redtape. Many of these delays come from trying to navigate a regulatory system that was developed around one specific technology, which is water-cooled reactors. The traditional water-cooled reactors have powered our Navy and our electricity grid and have done it successfully for decades, but today's entrepreneurs are pursuing very different designs. They are using high-temperature gases, molten salts, and other high-tech materials to advance the safety, efficiency, and reliability of nuclear energy.  The nuclear regulatory system needs to be updated to enable this innovation. That is why I join with my colleagues in introducing the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization[[Page S1613]]Cosponsors include Senators Whitehouse, Inhofe, Booker, Fischer, Capito, and We come together having introduced 512. Our bipartisan bill seeks to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by providing a flexible regulatory framework for licensing advanced nuclear reactors. The NRC needs a modern regulatory framework that is predictable and efficient. Reactor operators for both traditional and advanced reactors need timely decisionmaking from the Nuclear Regulatory At the same time, the Commission needs to maintain its ability to assess a variety of technologies and meet its mission of administering safety and security to the American people. Additionally, our legislation will update the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's fee recovery rules.  This measure is going to bring increased transparency and accountability to the NRC, while also improving the Commission's efficiency and timeliness.  This bill will also help to preserve the uranium producers who are essential to powering the technology. The Energy Information Administration reports that uranium production in 2016 was at its lowest level since way back in 2005. It is crucial that we restore our American uranium sector and preserve these important jobs.  Our bipartisan legislation is going to enable the development of innovative reactors with bold, new technologies. As a nation, we can either lead this technology revolution or we can defer to our competitors. China and Russia are already developing advanced technologies regardless of what we do here in the United America needs to be a leader of nuclear development. We need to create an environment where entrepreneurs can flourish. This is the way to create jobs here at home and revitalize our nuclear energy sector at the same time.  One way to enable innovation for advanced reactors is to provide a regulatory framework that is predictable and cost-effective and that maintains the NRC's safety and security mission. The bill we haved introduced, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, does all of this.  This broadly bipartisan bill will strengthen American energy independence and foster innovation and job creation.

Frankly, the fact that we are even here discussing this, and that there is opposition to this bill at all, really does break my heart, and it speaks to the depths of the entanglement with the big abortion industry that exist in some corners of this Because, at the end of the day, you know what this bill really is about? The right to choose.  We hear our friends across the aisle use the phrase a lot. But what about the other right to choose, the right of the taxpayer to choose not to pay for the practice that violates everything that they believe? That is what we are here to protect.  The American people support this policy, with 6 in 10 surveyed saying that taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. And these are both pro-life and pro-choice.  So today, Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues across the aisle to honor the will of their constituents. I am asking them to remember the good old Democratic rallying cry of safe, legal, and rare abortion. Obviously, abortion is not rare today when over 330,000 abortions are performed in 1 year.  If my colleagues still believe these words, they will join us in supporting this modest solution to keep unsuspecting taxpayers off of the hook for this practice. And if they can't vote for this bill then there is truly not a single limit on abortion that they will accept, and that is a sad commentary on the state of politics.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just clarify for the Record that there is no Federal funding for abortion. All you have to do is read the Hyde amendment, which has been in effect for 40 years. I don't support it, but that is the law of the land.  The majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal. So if you want to talk about polls, the overwhelming number of Americans believe that abortions should be safe and legal.  I also would like to say that while my colleagues are working overtime to try to defund organizations like Planned Parenthood, it is because of Planned Parenthood, the counseling that is provided, and the reproductive services that are provided at their clinics, and contraception, that the number of abortions have decreased in this country.

9638,topic-id,2117,"Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in opposition to this resolution. Many of my colleagues know that we have had discussions in the Senate on several Congressional Review Act resolutions. In principle, Congressional Review Act resolutions--besides repealing these existing Executive regulations--also have the unfortunate aspect to them that they negate an agency's ability to make new rules anytime soon in the same area. For example, if you like some of this rule but not all of it, by using the CRA, you are literally preventing the agency from moving forward on any improvements to the rule.  I always believe in the legislative process. Working with my colleague from Alaska or working with my colleagues from other areas, I think we have proved that we can resolve key issues. But passing this Congressional Review Act resolution on an issue so important as our public lands and negating the hard work that the executive branch did over a long period of time is something that my colleagues and I just have to say no to.  When it comes to public lands, we want transparency; we want sunshine. We want a bottom-up approach when it comes to land management, and we certainly want collaboration.  As was said earlier, the Bureau of Land Management manages about 245 million acres of public land. That is about 10 percent of the Nation and 30 percent of our Nation's minerals. So when it comes to this management, it is very important that they continue to follow a very good bottom-up process for land management.  I will read now from the actual requirements from the law that oversees them, the Federal Land Policy and Management They have to use and observe the principles of multiple use and sustained yield; consider present and potential uses of the public lands; weigh long-term benefits to the public against short-term benefits; consider the relative scarcity of the values; give priority to areas of critical environmental concern; provide for compliance with applicable pollution control laws, including State and Federal air, water, noise, or other pollution standards or implementation plans; and coordinate with Federal Departments and Agencies, State and local governments, and Indian  So all of these things are part of what is already in existing law. The concept here is to make sure that we continue to have a transparent and open process that is bottom-up. And I certainly believe in a bottom-up process because our public lands must not be territories owned and operated, for example, for the sole benefit of the oil, gas, and mining industries, and we can't have polluters polluting in these areas and not have input from the various communities about their concerns on those issues.  For example, in 2001, the Bush administration proposed revisions to six land use plans in eastern Utah, and these plans were finalized in 2008 at the end of the Bush administration, with only limited opportunity for public involvement. All six plans were challenged in Federal court by several motorized recreation and conservation organizations.  It is now 2017, and these plans still remain tied up in litigation. That is why those in the off-road vehicle industry did not feel as though they had input at the very beginning stages of the process. In January the Obama administration negotiated a settlement, which is still pending in court, but this shows how, if there isn't meaningful public involvement, we are just going to hit a logjam. This is why I think it is so important for us to update this rule.  It has been a long time since the agency updated this rule; I think since 1983. That was the last time--over 30 years ago. I guarantee you, in those 30 years, we can come up with a better process for input from our constituents on important land use issues.  I know the new Interior Secretary likes to talk about Teddy Roosevelt, who once said: ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.''  Ensuring we are preserving and increasing the value of our public lands is exactly what is meant by this planning rule that the Bureau of Land Management put out. This rule wants to make sure that we have input from the local community.  I think it is important to note that this is not a rule that regulates any specific use on public lands. It does not restrict any particular activity. It simply updates the current law in saying that it is better to have input from local officials and to use that input from local officials to update the process in an earlier way.  I said to my staff: It is like us huddling and saying that we should write legislation and then me not coming back for 7 years and then letting them know I am on my way to the Senate floor to drop a bill. We would never do that, and the land plans in these communities shouldn't be done that way either.  Once a local Bureau of Land Management official starts to discuss a plan, there should be transparency. The local community should know exactly what that plan looks like before it is going to be finalized. It needs to encourage collaboration of the stakeholders or else--as the example I just gave in Utah--you are going to end up in litigation or an elongated process before such management plans can take place.  It seems to me that these are pretty reasonable goals: Have a bottom-up process that encourages discussion throughout the plan so that local communities are not caught off guard, and continue to emphasize the roles of State, local, and Tribal governments and cooperating agencies so that they can have input in the process as well.  Finally, I know that there are some who would like to claim that the BLM State director oversees the planning process in their specific State and that somehow that might change, but that is not the case.  Many organizations understand that there will continue to be a bottom-up process under the new rule. That is why so many sportsmen and outdoors groups--like the Outdoor Industry Association, the National Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the Nature Conservancy, the Wilderness Society, and the National Parks Conservation Association--all say: Do not overturn the rule that was implemented. These groups know that 30 years is too long of a period of time to have to wait to encourage public involvement and collaboration, that[[Page S1612]]these issues are too important to try to turn back the clock and to try to exclude sportsmen and various interests of public access from the planning and use of our public lands.  I hope my colleagues will turn down this override of a very important project that has guaranteed public access, transparency, and sunshine in planning for our public lands.                                Medicaid  Madam President, I would like to come to the floor to discuss the proposed Medicaid changes that are part of what the House is proposing to the Affordable Care This is so important because, as many people know, Medicaid has been a bedrock of how individuals get access to healthcare in our country. And in many parts of our States--at least the State of Washington--Medicaid has been a lifeline in both rural communities and in urban areas and we have heard much from various people that it is actually helping to stabilize healthcare costs, so costs are not rising as fast and giving people access to care in the most serious situations where we are trying to fight opioids or are trying to find more efficiency in our healthcare system.  First of all, I think the House bill is literally a war on I say that because it is a capitation of healthcare costs.  The federal government, according to one budget analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, would shift the cost to the States by more than $500 billion over the next 10 years. That would mean that millions of people would lose coverage and be affected by this kind of repeal.  Now, many people have talked about how they might block-grant I also thought that was a horrible idea because, really, it just becomes nothing but a budget mechanism to reduce the Federal partnership that exists between the Federal Government and the States on But the House chose not to do exactly block-granting. They said, instead, that we are just going to have a budget cap at the Federal level on how much money they are going to spend on Medicaid and then work toward the repeal of Medicaid expansion. This is a very bad idea.  The actual per capita cut--I know my colleagues like to come out here and talk about a patient-centered relationship, which is exactly what getting off fee-for-service and going to managed care does. But a per capita cost is nothing but a budget mechanism to cap the Federal responsibility to Medicaid and cut costs and basically shift the pain onto the  I have been on various meeting tours in the State of Washington, talking to my constituents about this. In Seattle, Spokane, and I met with hospitals, community clinics, women's health groups, local and State government officials, civic leaders, civil rights organizations, and I heard many things.  I basically heard hospitals say there is evidence that Medicaid is actually lowering the commercial insurance premiums because of less uncompensated care. And I heard a safety net hospital in Spokane tell me that the population is already 70 percent Medicaid and Medicare and that there is no way they can absorb this kind of a cut to the Medicaid program and it would just mean healthcare costs would rise in the future. I heard a hospital in Seattle tell me that this kind of attempt is nothing but a budget trigger. It is not a reform of the system. It is simply a way to cut the budget.  What we believe is that Medicaid is a key part of our healthcare delivery system. The expansion has worked well and we should continue to move to ways to innovate Medicaid as a way to save costs.  Unfortunately, right now, many people misunderstand how important Medicaid is in the mental health and addiction area. Basically, when you take what we have tried to do to address the opioid epidemic, those individuals who are working through the bills that we just recently passed to try to help patients in the emergency room or who are in psychiatric care or who are trying to deal with this grave problem we have in the United States, getting rid of Medicaid for those individuals, you might as well roll back all the assistance we just provided as part of the CURES and other legislation. Why? Because these individuals will not be able to access the type of care they need without the support.  I do believe that what we need to do is innovate instead. There are many examples of innovation in our healthcare delivery system. One example, as I have mentioned on the floor several times, is going from nursing home care to community-based care.  Medicaid is going to equal long-term care. So many Americans are not going to be ready to deal with their long-term healthcare issues, and when they are not, they are going to use Medicaid for their long-term care.  We showed in the State of Washington over more than a decade's period of time that we could save $2.7 billion by shifting our Medicaid population to community-based care instead of nursing home care. If we would do that same kind of innovation at the Federal level, we could achieve substantial savings instead of saving money by cutting.  The issue here is that innovation in our delivery system--innovation, not a budget cap--is what is going to help us with our healthcare needs for the future when it comes to the Medicaid population.  So I urge my colleagues to speak loudly against this proposal to try to cap Medicaid, to try to shift the burden to States and local providers, to county governments, to jails, to all of those individuals who are going to see that population when and if they don't have Medicaid coverage and instead work together on expanding the innovation in Medicaid and coming up with savings we need to take care of and to provide health insurance coverage to so many  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Since 1851, the United States has enjoyed formal diplomatic relations with Costa Rica, one of Latin America's most enduring democracies, and the close cooperation between our two countries is an example of how international engagement consistently advances U.national interests and national security.  In recent years, Costa Rica has become one of the United States' most strategic security partners in Central In 2016, in response to the challenges of increasing cocaine trafficking in the region, President Solis's administration developed a security strategy that sets aggressive goals to expand its capacity to control Costa Rica's sovereign airspace and maritime territory. Last year, Costa Rica seized more than 24,000 kilos of cocaine that were ultimately bound to the United[[Page S1968]]Despite a difficult fiscal situation, Costa Rica is projected to increase its investment in security by 20 percent in 2017. I commend the Obama administration's decision to donate two Island-class cutters to the Costa Rican Coast Guard, which will greatly boost Costa Rica's capacity to combat the narcotics trade. This also serves as a reminder of the strategic value of the State Department's security cooperation at a time when the Trump administration is proposing shortsighted cuts to our foreign assistance budget.  Additionally, I want to call attention to Costa Rica's collaboration with the United States in addressing the humanitarian challenges related to individuals fleeing violence in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Between 2013 and 2016, the number of migrants from these three countries who have requested asylum in Costa Rica more than quadrupled, a dramatic increase that reflects the urgency of the situation in Central In a clear demonstration of President Solis's leadership on these issues, Costa Rica and the United States signed an agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, to establish a relocation and processing facility in Costa Rica for up to 200 at-risk migrants at a time from Guatemala, El Salvador, and This critical screening provides immediate protection for those most vulnerable and opens opportunities for these individuals to be relocated to third countries.  Our joint agreement with UNHCR is but one example of U.and Costa Rican collaboration at multilateral fora. Costa Rica has consistently voted with the United States at the United Nations on critical issues related to Syria, North Korea, and In the past year, Costa Rica has also used its voice and vote at the Organization of American States to express concern about the growing challenges to democracy and human rights in  Furthermore, in August 2016, Costa Rica's commitment to human rights was on display when it became the first country to ratify the Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance--an important step toward a more just and egalitarian society within the The convention reinforces international standards on all forms of discrimination, reaffirms the commitment of member states of the OAS to the complete and unconditional eradication of racism, and takes a step forward in the legal definition of contemporary forms of racism.  As a champion of environmental stewardship, Costa Rica has made great strides to develop renewable energy. Costa Rica recently set an ambitious carbon neutrality goal for 2021 and is well positioned to achieve this important objective. The country recently ran 75 days straight on renewable power, and, with continued foreign investment and U.diplomatic assistance, Costa Rica is on its way to becoming a carbon-neutral nation. I am hopeful that our diplomatic mission to Costa Rica will continue to support the country's interest in being a leader in the fight against climate change. Helping Costa Rica realize innovations in its power sector helps foster a broader strategic partnership with an important neighbor in our hemisphere.  At a moment characterized by the Trump administration's isolationist rhetoric, it is critically important to recognize that the United States is safer when we cooperate with other countries in the region to fight the battle against organized crime and illegal drug-trafficking. At the same time, Costa Rica's cooperation with the United Nations to support orderly and lawful migration, its collaboration with its neighbors in the region, and its efforts to promote human rights regionally are worthy of our commendation. Costa Rica is a true partner of the United States, and it is imperative that we continue to strengthen and expand the cooperation between our two countries to promote more security, prosperity, and stability in Central America and across the hemisphere.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1967-2.txt,,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,23.0,February

9732,topic-id,311,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 55, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure This bipartisan bill will codify and make permanent what is commonly referred to as the Hyde amendment and expand Hyde amendment restrictions to all Federal agencies.  First offered in 1976, the Hyde amendment prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions through government programs like These restrictions have been maintained for more than 40 years through the annual appropriations process, including the most recent continuing resolution passed last It is time that these important protections against the use of taxpayer funding to pay for abortion be made permanent.  A GAO report in 2014 found that, under ObamaCare, over 1,000 insurance plans covered elective abortion. Those plans are purchased with taxpayer subsidies. H.7 would stop this and make ObamaCare conform to the Hyde amendment. If the Hyde amendment had been applied to ObamaCare, as President Obama promised it would be, the number of federally subsidized plans with elective abortion coverage would have been zero.  As we work to repeal and replace the deeply flawed ObamaCare, we need to ensure taxpayer subsidies are not used to pay for abortion coverage.  According to a Marist Poll conducted last July, 62 percent of respondents--a majority of the women asked--and including 45 percent of those who identify as pro-choice do not support taxpayer funding for abortions. H.7 simply codifies and makes permanent a protection against the use of taxpayer funding for abortion that the majority of Americans and certainly a majority of my constituents in Wyoming support.  Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow consideration of H.7.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

9764,topic-id,4586,"Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 23 faith-based organizations and communities urging Members to reject H.7; a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union urging Members to vote ``no'' on H.7; a letter from 44 women's health, religious, and other advocacy organizations strongly opposed to H.7; and a letter from the American Association of University Women urging Members to oppose H.7.                                     House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, January 28, 2014       Dear Representative: As leaders of faith-based      organizations and communities, we urge you to reject H.7,      a bill introduced as the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for      Abortion Act,'' which would harm a woman's health, economic      security, and religious liberty by making coverage of      abortion inaccessible in both public and private health      plans. Enclosed is a statement of shared principles that      compel us, together with 20 of our partner organizations from      the faith community, to speak out against legislation like      H.7, which seeks to impose a narrowly-defined view of one      religious viewpoint on every citizen, threatening the freedom      of religion afforded to every individual by the U.           H.7 is sponsored in the House by Chris Smith (NJ-     4). This bill would raise taxes on women and families, as      well as small businesses, who access or offer abortion      coverage as part of a comprehensive insurance plan. It would      do so by denying women and families a premium assistance tax      credit if they choose a plan in the health insurance      marketplace that includes abortion, a proposal soundly      rejected by Congress in the 2010 health reform debate. This      bill would also deny small employers a Small Business Tax      Credit for offering their workers comprehensive coverage that      includes abortion. Further, as amended in committee, this      bill would withhold abortion coverage from women enrolled in      a multistate, private insurance plan. Taken together, these      provisions would jeopardize coverage of abortion in the full      private insurance market, risking coverage that many women      and families have today; more than 80 percent of private      health plans currently cover abortion care.       Also among its provisions, H.7 would make permanent      dangerous restrictions that withhold abortion coverage from      women who access coverage or care through federal programs,      such as women enrolled in Medicaid, federal employees, Native      American women, and others. It would also permanently      withhold abortion coverage from low-income women living in      the District of Columbia, a federal ban that goes against the      wishes of DC elected officials and voters. These provisions      would disproportionately harm women struggling to make ends      meet, risking their economic security, health and well-being,      and ability to make personal decisions in accordance with      their own conscience and religious or moral beliefs.[[Page H628]]       Please see the enclosed statement outlining shared      principles of faith that compel us and our partners to speak      out against this harmful proposal. As communities and      organizations that represent diverse constituencies of faith,      we stand united in opposition to H.7 given the danger it      poses to women and their families by jeopardizing affordable      and accessible insurance coverage of abortion.       We urge you to reject H.7 when it reaches the House      floor for a vote.

We are deeply troubled by legislative      efforts designed to restrict women's access to comprehensive      reproductive health care options, including abortion,      contraception, HIV/STD testing, cancer screenings, and other      essential health services.       We recognize that issues surrounding women's reproductive      choices--and those regarding abortion in particular--are      complex. Although we come from diverse faith traditions, we      all agree that proposals aimed at restricting access to      reproductive healthcare would have devastating consequences      for women and their families, particularly low-income women.      We call on Congress and the President to reject these      intolerable measures.       As people of faith, the following common principles compel      us to speak out together against these proposals:       Striving for social justice and equal rights to health      care: All too often, legislation is proposed that would      create significant barriers to women's access to reproductive      health options and make it harder for women to make their own      reproductive choices based on their individual beliefs and      consciences. We are especially concerned about efforts to de-     fund the Title X Family Planning program and those      organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, that serve as a      key part of our social safety net. Title X health centers and      clinics are on the public health front lines, serving low-     income individuals and other vulnerable populations. These      centers help men and women of limited means prevent      unintended pregnancies; they promote prevention of, and      treatment for HIV and other STDs; they offer life-saving      cancer screenings; and they provide crucial medically-     accurate information about sexual health. Title X providers      ensure that women who want to have children get the      information and care they need to promote a healthy      pregnancy. As faith-centered organizations, we are committed      to the most marginalized and the most vulnerable of our      society, especially those with limited financial means or      those who live in areas with limited access to services.      Reducing health care options for some, based on their      economic strata or geographic location, is profoundly unjust.       Respecting women's moral agency: We affirm women as moral      agents who have the capacity, right, and responsibility to      make their own decisions about sexuality, reproduction, and      their families. Legislation that eliminates health coverage      for and limits the availability of reproductive health care      services through funding restrictions would severely limit a      woman's ability to make decisions about her own health care      and about how best to care for her family, guided by her own      conscience, her personal circumstances, and her own moral or      faith tradition.       Valuing compassion and the obligation to protect every      woman's health and life: Restrictions on women's health care      options endanger women's lives. In particular, we oppose      proposals that would allow hospitals and individual health      workers to refuse to provide abortion services to a woman,      even when such care is necessary to save her life. As people      of faith, we strongly believe that a health worker's right to      refuse to provide certain services must not infringe on a      woman's right to access the health care she needs. Above all,      that refusal must not endanger her life. Health professionals      and the organizations that support them have an obligation to      ensure access to necessary services, whether directly or by      referral to an accessible alternative health care provider.       Safeguarding religious liberty: We believe that one      person's religious viewpoint must not be imposed on others.      Different faiths, and even groups within a single faith      community, hold varying views and opinions. Time and again,      our nation has answered this diversity of opinions by      upholding the founding principle of religious freedom.      Reproductive freedoms are integrally bound with religious      freedoms--a connection recognized by the Supreme Court's      1973 decision in Roe v. Women have a right to make      reproductive health choices based on their own faith      tradition, free from constraints imposed by those seeking      to legislate one religious viewpoint or another. We oppose      legislation that would erode Americans' constitutionally      protected right to religious freedom.       As people of faith, we believe in compassion, justice, and      the dignity of all women. We understand that those who would      restrict women's access to comprehensive reproductive health      care are often motivated by their religious beliefs and seek      to impose their views on others. However, freedom of choice      means that every person is valued as a moral decision-maker,      free to make personal decisions about their reproductive      lives based on their own religious beliefs and consciences.      We cannot presume to tell others how best to inform and      listen to their own consciences as they make decisions about      whether and when to have children or how best to care for      their families. Today, and every day, we stand up as people      of faith for women's health and reproductive choices--and we      urge our government to do the same.

Vote ``NO'' on H.7, the ``No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and             Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017''       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil      Liberties Union (ACLU) and our nearly two million members and      supporters, we urge Members of the House of Representatives      to vote no on H.7, the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for      Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of      2017.'' The ACLU opposes this legislation, which would make      harmful, discriminatory abortion coverage restrictions      permanent and interfere with private health insurance      coverage for abortion.       H.7 would make permanent the Hyde Amendment and its      progeny, discriminatory abortion coverage restrictions that      single out and exclude abortion from a host of programs that      fulfill the government's obligation to provide health care.      These restrictions disproportionately impact those who      already face significant barriers to care--low-income      families, women of color, immigrants, young people, LGBTQ      people, and those in rural areas. They discriminate against      these women, who rely on the government for health care, by      severely restricting their access to a health care service      that is readily available to women of means and women with      private insurance.       A woman in need of abortion care who does not have      independent financial resources must scramble to raise the      necessary funds, delay receiving care, and is often left with      no choice but to carry to term in circumstances where she is      physically, emotionally, or financially unprepared to care      for a child. In fact, restricting Medicaid coverage of      abortion forces one in four poor women seeking abortion to      carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. When a woman seeking an      abortion is denied one, she is three times more likely to      fall into poverty than a woman who can obtain the care she      needs. If a woman chooses to carry to term, Medicaid (and      other federal insurance programs) offers her assistance for      the necessary medical care. But if she needs to end her      pregnancy, the same programs will deny her coverage for her      abortion. The government should not interfere with a woman's      personal medical decisions by selectively withholding      benefits in this way.       H.7 also takes particular aim at low-income women in the      District of Although the use of federal funds is      currently restricted from covering most abortions, states are      free to use their own funds to include abortion coverage in      their medical assistance programs. The only exception is the      District of H.7 would make permanent a provision      that forbids the District from using its own locally raised      non-federal dollars to provide coverage for abortion for its      low-income residents. The D.abortion ban disenfranchises      the District's residents, and allows non-resident Members of      Congress who are not accountable to the people of the      District to impose their own ideology upon the District's      residents with impunity.       H.R 7 would also impact women's ability to purchase private      insurance that includes abortion coverage. It would revive      the so-called Stupak Amendment, rejected by the 111th      Congress, which would bar anyone receiving a federal premium      assistance credit from buying a private insurance policy that      includes abortion coverage on the Affordable Care Act's (ACA)      insurance exchanges. This is not only an attempt to      effectively ban abortion coverage in the exchanges by      encouraging insurers to exclude it, but it would have a      ripple effect on plans outside the exchanges that jeopardizes      abortion coverage for millions of women. Further, the      inaccurate disclosure requirements in H.7[[Page H629]]     would push insurance companies to drop abortion coverage and      deter women from purchasing plans that include such coverage      by misleading them about the cost of purchasing these plans.      These provisions are direct attacks on a woman's ability to      make personal medical decisions with complete and accurate      information.       Additionally, H.7 rewrites tax law to penalize a single,      legal, medical procedure: abortion. It would deny small      businesses tax credits if the insurance they provide to their      employees includes abortion coverage, effectively coercing      employers to offer plans that exclude abortion. The bill      would also deny millions of women and families premium tax      credits if they purchase a health insurance plan that covers      abortion, forcing them to forgo comprehensive health      insurance plans in order to get the premium assistance they      need. This manipulation of the tax code is simply government      interference in taxpayers' private medical decisions and      should be rejected.       Abortion is basic, constitutionally-protected health care      for women. Yet H.7 attacks women's fundamental right and      access to abortion. It first targets women--particularly poor      women and women of color who rely on the government for their      health care--and seeks to permanently deny them coverage for      a benefit to which they are entitled. Then, under the guise      of ``safeguarding'' taxpayer dollars, H.7 advances an      aggressive campaign to destabilize the insurance market for      abortion coverage. Congress should be eliminating barriers to      women's ability to exercise their constitutionally protected      right to safe, legal abortion. Instead, H.7 would      interfere with women's personal medical decisions by putting      even more bathers in the way.       For these reasons, the ACLU opposes H.7 and urges      members of the House of Representatives to vote no.           Sincerely,     Faiz Shakir,       Director, Washington Legislative     Georgeanne Usova,       Legislative                                  ____       Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations strongly      urge you to oppose the deceptive ``No Taxpayer Funding for      Abortion Act'' (H.7), a bill designed to fundamentally      alter the health insurance market--from a market where      abortion coverage is the industry standard to one where      abortion coverage is eliminated. H.7 does this by changing      the laws that govern both private and public insurance and by      twisting the tax code into a tool to take away abortion      coverage from women who have it. Ultimately, this bill is      designed to deny women the decision whether or not to have an      abortion by taking away their insurance coverage.       H.7 twists the tax code into a tool to take away health      insurance coverage that women have today. For example, the      bill would deny millions of women and families premium tax      credits if they purchase a health insurance plan that covers      abortion. The bill would force these women--particularly low      and moderate income women--to forego a health insurance plan      that includes abortion in order to get the premium assistance      they need. H.7 would also raise taxes on small businesses      by denying the Small Business Health Tax Credit to businesses      that offer health insurance that covers abortion. This credit      was created to encourage small businesses to offer health      insurance to their employees by making it more affordable.      This bill would penalize employers for choosing comprehensive      coverage for their employees and their families.       H.7 could cause the entire insurance market to drop      abortion coverage. The impact of H.7's changes could be      that women across the country lose comprehensive health      insurance that includes abortion coverage. The elimination of      abortion coverage in the Marketplaces is expected to set the      industry standard, meaning that all plans, inside and outside      the Marketplace, could drop such coverage.       H.7 introduces a new ban on private insurance by forcing      all multi-state insurance plans to drop abortion coverage.      Currently, the law requires that at least one multi-state      health insurance plan in a Marketplace must not provide      abortion coverage (except for narrow exceptions). H.7      would replace this requirement with a dramatic restriction      banning abortion coverage in all multi-state health insurance      plans.       The Rules Committee Print of H.7 includes new provisions      that would impose inaccurate and misleading disclosure      requirements regarding abortion coverage in plans offered in      the This bill overrides existing provisions of      the Affordable Care Act that provide consumers with      information about their health plans, and instead adds new      requirements intended to push insurance companies to drop      abortion coverage and deter women from purchasing plans that      include such coverage. Moreover, H.7 wrongly asserts that      there is a ``surcharge'' in plans that cover abortion, and      would require women to be misled with this falsehood. These      new provisions are not about disclosure, but about      eliminating abortion coverage, in line with the rest of the      bill's dangerous provisions.       H.7 would permanently ban federal health insurance      programs such as Medicaid from including abortion coverage.      H.7 would codify harmful legislative riders that deny      abortion coverage to women who receive health insurance      through the federal government. Moreover, H.7 makes      permanent a rider that denies the District of Columbia the      ability to decide whether to use its own local finds to      provide abortion coverage. These bans disproportionately      affect women of color and low-income women, denying these      women the ability to make their own important health care      decisions.       H.7 would endanger women's health by eliminating      coverage of abortion even in circumstances where a woman      needs an abortion to prevent severe, permanent damage to her      health. Because H.7 only makes exceptions in the cases      where the woman's life is endangered, or where she is the      survivor of rape or incest, it would leave women whose health      is seriously threatened by their pregnancies without access      to the care their doctors recommend to protect their health.      The impact can be especially harmful to women underserved by      the health care system and women with serious health      problems.       In summary, H.7 would deny millions of women the ability      to make their own decision about whether to have an abortion.      H.7 is a dangerous bill that jeopardizes women's health by      directly banning abortion coverage, by raising taxes on      families and small businesses that purchase comprehensive      insurance coverage, and by imposing ``disclosure''      requirements that encourage the elimination of abortion      coverage. The intent and impact of H.7 is to forever      eliminate coverage of abortion in all insurance markets. We      strongly urge you to reject this bill.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 170,000      bipartisan members and supporters of the American Association      of University Women (AAUW), I urge you to oppose H.7, a      dangerous limitation on abortion that puts women's health and      rights at risk. H.7 would withhold abortion coverage from      virtually all women in the U.and potentially push insurers      into ceasing coverage of abortion care. This bill is a part      of a political strategy that seeks to interfere with women's      personal decision-making around their reproductive health      care.       AAUW supports the right of every woman to access safe,      accessible, affordable, and comprehensive family planning and      reproductive health services. We believe that all women      should be able to make their own decisions with advice and      support from those they trust the most. We know that women      look to doctors, family members, and other trusted      individuals, not politicians, to make important medical      decisions about their health.       H.7 would make abortion restrictions that are often      built into annual appropriations bills permanent. Such an      action would withhold abortion coverage from almost all      women--those who rely on Medicaid, federal insurance plans      and health programs, as well as those who are Peace Corps      Volunteers, Native American women, Washington, D.     residents, and many others. In addition, by creating      burdensome regulations for insurers to cover abortion      services, many more women would lose access to the care they      need. When policymakers deny women insurance coverage for      abortion, women are forced to either carry the pregnancy to      term or pay for care out of their own pockets. Consequently,      cutting off access to or placing strict limitations on      abortion can have profoundly harmful effects on public      health, particularly for those who already face significant      barriers to receiving care, such as low-income women,      immigrant women, LGBTQ people, and women of color.       Again, I urge you to oppose H.7, a dangerous limitation      on abortion that puts[[Page H630]]     women's health and rights at risk.

The rule defines how we are going to consider this legislation. This is a closed rule. This is a Putin rule. This is a rule that allows no opposing viewpoints to be brought before this Chamber to be debated and voted on. It is completely closed. On top of that, it didn't go through regular order.  Now, I know my colleagues will say, well, it went through regular order in the previous But there are 55 new Members of the House in this Congress, and I think they have a right to expect regular order from the leadership of this House when legislation is brought to the floor. The rule should be rejected because it is closed.  I would urge my colleagues, even those who may be sympathetic to the underlying legislation to, at some point, stand up to your leadership and say, ``Enough of this closed process.'' Open this place up a little bit. This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, and yet we do everything but deliberate. At some point, I hope some of my Republican colleagues will be brave enough to stand with us who are calling for a more open process.  I also urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the underlying bill.  I also include in the Record an article from Politico entitled, ``Study: Abortion Rate Falls to Record Low.''                     [From Politico, 17, 2017]                Study: Abortion Rate Falls to Record Low                           (By Brianna Ehley)       The U.abortion rate dipped to its lowest level on record      in 2014, according to a new study by the Guttmacher            The abortion rate dropped 14 percent between 2011 and 2014      to 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women, researchers said. During      the same time period, the number of abortions dropped 12      percent to 926,200 in 2014.       Researchers suggested two main reasons for the decline: a      combination of greater access to contraception and less      access to abortion services in states that have enacted new      restrictions.       The number of clinics providing abortions dipped 6 percent      between 2011 and 2014, with the largest declines in access in      the Midwest and the       ``Abortion restrictions and clinic closures mean that      patients may need to travel greater distances to access      services,'' Rachel Jones, the study's lead author, said in a      statement. ``Some of the abortion rate decline is likely      attributable to women who were prevented from accessing      needed services.''  Mr.Madam Speaker, part of the reason for that is because women are having more access to good health care. Part of the reason why that number is getting lower is because of organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provide clinics and counseling and contraception to young women so that we can actually avoid more people being in the situation where they have to confront the issue of abortion. And yet my colleagues' next salvo is going to be going after Planned The abortion rate in this country is going down.  The underlying bill is not about making sure that taxpayer money doesn't go to fund abortion. That is what the Hyde amendment does.  The Affordable Care Act, by the way, makes it clear that no portion of the premium tax credits may be used to pay for the portion of comprehensive health coverage that is purchased in the marketplace that relates to abortion services. That is not what this is about.  This is basically the first attempt to really go after the basic constitutional right for a woman to be able to choose when it comes to abortion services. That is what this is about. The leadership of this House--indeed, the President of the United States--has made it clear they want to repeal Roe v. They want to put Justices on the Supreme Court who will repeal that decision. They want to pass legislation that will do everything to be able to deny women that basic right. That is what is going on here.  Finally, Madam Speaker, I am asking people to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can actually debate and vote on this issue of requiring Presidential candidates and Presidents to release their tax returns. I say to my colleagues in all sincerity, this President's refusal to release his tax returns, all these conflicts of interest that he has, this is a White House on a collision course with corruption. Donald Trump said he wanted to come to Washington to drain the swamp, but by not releasing his tax returns, by allowing all these conflicts of interest to remain, he is bringing the swamp to the White  Let us vote for transparency here. Let us vote in a way that the majority of Americans think we ought to do, and that is to require this President to come clean, to show us what his tax returns are, to show us what he is hiding, to show us where his investments are, to show us if there are any dealings with Russia or Putin or whatever.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can have that opportunity to be able to debate that issue, because if you don't vote ``no,'' I can guarantee you that the Committee on Rules will never make it in order. The Committee on Rules never makes anything in order that the leadership of this House doesn't put its rubber stamp on. I think that that is unfortunate. As I said before, the Committee on Rules is becoming a place where democracy goes to die. It is about time that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle stand up and say, ``Let's open this place up.''  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

9644,topic-id,1447,"Mr.President, yesterday the House of Representatives released a way forward to dismantle and replace ObamaCare, which will be to deliver on one of our biggest campaign promises made to the American people, not just in 2016 but in essentially every election since 2010.  We know ObamaCare has been an unmitigated disaster. Premiums on the ObamaCare exchanges are up by 25 percent. Millions of Americans have been kicked off their healthcare plans, and the economy has been saddled with billions of dollars in new regulations.  The fact is, ObamaCare has been one broken promise after another. President Obama and advocates of this law said if you wanted to keep your plan, you could keep it, but that didn't pan out. They said if you liked your doctor, you didn't have to find another one. That didn't turn out to be true either. They promised people across the country would have more coverage, more options, and better healthcare, all at a more affordable price. Well, that ended up not being true either.  The truth is, ObamaCare hasn't made healthcare more affordable for a lot of In fact, in Texas, if you have a gross income of $24,000, you can end up spending up to 30 percent of your gross income just on healthcare costs. That is not affordable healthcare. That is unaffordable healthcare.  Clearly, ObamaCare is no gold standard. It is a failed piece of legislation, one that is full of empty promises and one we have to scrap and start over again. Now we have an opportunity to do better for the people we represent, who are counting on us to deliver, to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with options that work.  I believe the plan released last night is a major step in the right direction. Patients need better tools like health savings accounts. That way they have more control over their healthcare decisions, and we can keep the bureaucracy out of it. We need to break down the barriers that restrict choice and keep Americans choosing an insurance plan that works for them and their families, and we need to empower employers, particularly small business owners, to provide their employees with the kind of affordable coverage that meets their needs.  To sum it up, we need to move healthcare decisions out of Washington and send them back to the States and back to patients and families and their doctors. That will only happen once we[[Page S1615]]repeal ObamaCare and replace it with options that work for more affordable healthcare coverage that patients choose, not that the government mandates and punishes you if you don't buy it but freedom of choice at a better cost and meeting the needs of individual patients.  I am glad our colleagues in the House and our friends in the White House fully understand why this is such a priority and why we need to keep the promise we made. As soon as we can do that and deliver on that major promise to the American people--the sooner we do that, a whole lot of American families across the country will feel relief.                              Nominations  Mr.President, this morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered the nominations of Rod Rosenstein and Rachel Brand as Deputy Attorney General and Associate Attorney General, respectively. Both of them are longtime, well-respected public servants. Mr.Rosenstein has spent his career serving the Justice Department and Presidents of both political parties. In fact, Mr.Rosenstein started in the George H.Bush Justice Department back in 1990, and he served every President since that time. He is a career public servant who has served in a bipartisan manner and has also been confirmed by the President Bush appointed him to be U.attorney and so did President  When the Obama administration needed a prosecutor of the utmost integrity to investigate national security leaks that looked highly political, they turned--you guessed it--to Rod Put another way, if Rod Rosenstein is not an acceptable nominee, who is?  This morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I heard some of our colleagues suggest that Mr.Rosenstein needed to make a pledge to appoint a special counsel if he was confirmed as Deputy Attorney We had two of our Maryland colleagues extoll his credentials, and rightly so, and call him a person of the utmost integrity and professionalism. Yet they, in essence, wanted him to fire himself once he became Deputy Attorney General and appoint a special counsel to do the job he would be confirmed and nominated to do. He wisely declined to make that judgment, certainly before he has had access to the facts and the information needed.  I believe he will make a formidable Deputy Attorney General, but instead of actually vetting the candidates on the merits of their impressive backgrounds and strong credentials, some used the hearing as an opportunity to air their various grievances on the current Attorney General, our former colleague Jeff Over the weekend, some went so far as to threaten to block Mr.Rosenstein's nomination if he wouldn't agree to appoint a special counsel.  I hope my colleagues in this Chamber don't stonewall his nomination or use it as a platform to disparage Attorney General The Attorney General made a decision to recuse himself from a further official role in looking into the allegations of Russian involvement in our election in 2016. I respect his decision. The fact is, we don't need another commission to study Russian involvement in the last election because we have a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, chaired by Senator Richard Burr and the Vice Chair is Mark Warner--a bipartisan Senate Select Committee that is doing a deep dive into the allegations, including gaining access to classified information which would be important to consider in reaching a conclusion.  Yesterday I was out at CIA Headquarters and saw four large binders' worth of classified material, which obviously I am not going to discuss, but it demonstrates that this investigation is already well underway. Members of the committee and our staff are already working with the intelligence community to get the information we need in order to reach an impartial and bipartisan conclusion.  The fact is, our Democratic friends have a short memory when it comes to the Obama Justice Department, one of the most politicalized Justice Departments in American history. Loretta Lynch, who privately met with President Bill Clinton while her Department was investigating his wife's email scandal, never recused herself from the matter.  Then there was Attorney General To my knowledge, he was the first Attorney General ever held in contempt of Congress because he refused to cooperate with our legitimate oversight responsibilities when it came to Operation Fast and Well, he never recused himself and never appointed a special counsel, even though I believe he should have. Compare Attorney General Sessions, who did what he believed was the right thing to do. He recused himself when there was even a suggestion he might not be able to be impartial. He made that commitment from the beginning, well before he was confirmed. He stood by that promise last week. Attorney General Sessions' integrity is intact, and he did the right thing, but Loretta Lynch didn't. Eric Holder didn't.  For our colleagues now to suggest that Attorney General Sessions not only should recuse himself but he should resign is beyond outrageous. To suggest that the incoming Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, should somehow abdicate the role he has been nominated for, and to which he will be confirmed, is to ask him to prejudge the case before he has even had a chance to look at the evidence.  All I am asking for is our colleagues to have a little perspective. These nominees are the right caliber of people with the exact expertise we need to make sure our Justice Department runs effectively and impartially follows the law of the land. These are the types of leaders you want to handle the big issues facing the Department of  I hope soon our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will turn their attention to doing what the American people sent them to do; that is, to consider legislation rather than dragging their feet and blocking the Trump administration from getting the team he has chosen to work with in various Cabinet positions and sub-Cabinet positions.  Hopefully, soon they will decide not to obstruct progress and grind this Chamber's business to a halt but rather will be partners with us, working together to try to build consensus where we can and move the country forward.

Now is the time for that power to be put back into the hands of the folks who know it best; that is, the people of Montana, not Washington, And the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0 rule is no different.  The resolution we are debating today, H.44, would block the implementation of a rule that would fundamentally change the land planning process at the It would be for the worst.  During the Obama administration's final days in office, they put through many midnight rules costing a total of $157 billion, including this rule shift which was issued on December 12, 2016, which fundamentally changes the land planning process. The rule shifts the planning and decisionmaking away from those who know the land best, away from BLM regional field offices, and back to BLM Headquarters in Washington, That is the exact opposite direction that land management should be going, and that is why this rule must go also.  This rule limits the voice of our local and State governments, and it strengthens the voice of folks who are living far away from the lands that are impacted.  Montana farmers, Montana ranchers, Montana miners, the Montana electric co-ops, Montana conservation districts, and Montana county commissioners have all expressed a concern for this rule and have urged congressional action. And there can't be a more commonsense list of Montanans than that list I just mentioned. In fact, even the western Governors are concerned. As recently as February 10, 2017, our own Governor of Montana, Steve Bullock, and Governor Daugaard from South Dakota urged Congress to direct BLM to reexamine the rule. ``Governors are concerned that BLM's emphasis on landscape-scale planning may lead to a resulting emphasis on national objectives over state and local objectives.'' ``Collectively, these changes severely limit the deference Governors were previously afforded with respect to RMP development.'' That is what our Governors are saying. I am quoting our Governors from the  There needs to be more balance in Federal land management. For the last 8 years, we have been out of balance. Oil and natural gas development on Federal lands dropped significantly under President In fact, for natural gas, we have seen an 18-percent decrease, while oil production on private and State lands doubled, versus the same on Federal land.  Montana has nearly 2 million acres of public land that are inaccessible to the public. Our farmers and ranchers in Montana need a more balanced partnership with the Federal land managers. They deserve more input in the development of land management policies, not less. By the way, our Federal forests in Montana are in dire need of more active management.  So where do we go next? There is no disagreement that revisions need to be made. Let's take this rule back to the drawing board and do it right. Let's work with our new Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, a Montanan, and President Trump to restore more western commonsense to land management.

9660,topic-id,617,"Mr.President, today, Senate Democrats will be voting to protect three programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social These programs represent core commitments our Nation has made to seniors, low-income Americans, children, and those living with disabilities.  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reflect who we are as At one time or another throughout our lives, most of us have or will count on these programs for health care or for financial stability.  During last year's Presidential debate, President-Elect Trump sought to distinguish himself from the field of Republican candidates by stating he was the first and only Republican candidate who would promise not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Yet, in their first major action of the new Congress, Republicans have taken the first step to dramatically alter and decimate core programs that comprise our safety net. Congressional Republicans want to gut funding, limit benefits, constrict eligibility, and turn guaranteed earned benefits into a voucher and a ``good luck'' wish. Their approach would violate the pledge we have made to millions of Americans and truly disrupt lives. This is unacceptable. That is why I am cosponsoring Senator Sanders' amendment to prohibit the Senate from considering any legislation that would violate Donald Trump's promise of not cutting Medicare, Medicaid, or Social  I am committed to ensuring that we meet the promise we made to Sixty million Americans, including 2 million Illinoisans, depend on Social Security for their well-being, and we must make sure that this vital program is there for both current and future generations.  By 2034, without any reform, Social Security will be unable to fulfill its promise to its beneficiaries. If Congress does not act, beneficiaries would immediately see their benefits reduced by one-fifth.  It remains Congress's responsibility to look to the future and protect the long-term solvency of Social Security while ensuring benefits meet the needs of beneficiaries, especially the most vulnerable among us.  Waiting until tomorrow to do what we could do today--an approach that I have seen fail in Illinois--only makes the task more difficult and likely to cause disruption.  I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, where we tried to address our budget challenges and the long-term solvency of Social I voted for the Commission's report because I believe we must face the difficult reality that doing nothing may harm the very people we are trying to protect--beneficiaries that rely on the promises we have made. I firmly believe that we, as Members of Congress, have a duty to have these debates and make difficult decisions, not just wait for the inevitable.  While I did not support everything in the final Commission's report, I believe the report included some commonsense options to improve the longterm solvency of Social Security: accelerating the alignment of payroll taxes to their intended level of 90 percent of wages and realigning benefits to reflect current poverty levels among seniors.  I believe there can and should be evenhanded, bipartisan agreement on a path forward. To do so, we need a collaborative and good-faith partnership to examine the universe of policy options.  Make no mistake--I oppose privatization of Social And recent solvency changes have weighed heavily on beneficiaries. That is why conversations should be balanced and targeted. There must be a dual goal of ensuring the adequacy of benefits, especially for those who rely on Social Security the most, and the long-term solvency of this program.

Tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information, including whether the candidate paid any taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes or offshore tax shelters.  The President and his spokesperson have both recently said that he will not release his tax returns because the American people ``don't care.'' I beg to differ.

9499,topic-id,571,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.321, the INSPIRE Women  This bill calls on the NASA administrator to support initiatives that encourage girls and young women to study STEM fields and pursue careers in aerospace. Unfortunately, women are woefully underrepresented in many STEM fields, including aeronautics and aerospace. One of the key barriers to women entering technical fields is self-selection out of STEM degrees due to a lack of role models.  In the words of longtime children's advocate and activist, Marian Wright Edelman: ``You can't be what you can't see.''  Too many girls and young women decide not to pursue studies in technical fields such as science, engineering, and aerospace because they look at their teachers and their role models and they see no one who looks like them.  When students are able to visualize themselves working in technical fields, they gain the confidence they need to take the first step in pursuit of a challenging and rewarding STEM career, to their benefit and to the benefit of society as a whole.  NASA, with its extraordinary STEM workforce, is in a unique position to help close this gap. The agency has access to a diverse group of current and retired women astronauts, scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and innovators whose accomplishments and career paths are just the sort of inspiration that girls and young women need.  Astronaut Kate Rubins broke barriers and boundaries when she became the first person to ever sequence DNA in space during her spaceflight last year.  Just last Friday, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander of the International Space Station, completed her seventh space walk.  Vera Rubin's recent passing reminded us of her trailblazing career in astronomy in which she made the groundbreaking discovery of dark matter.  As has already been mentioned by my friend and colleague, Barbara Comstock, the newly released movie, ``Hidden Figures,'' highlights through the pioneering story of early NASA mathematicians and engineers Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson that women have been instrumental to our aerospace enterprise since its inception.  NASA has developed a number of programs aimed at leveraging its inspirational workforce to encourage girls and young women to pursue STEM degrees and STEM careers. This includes the NASA GIRLS program, the Aspire 2 Inspire program, and the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research, or SISTER program.  H.321 instructs the NASA administrator to continue supporting these and other programs that encourage women and girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, as well as to pursue careers in aerospace.  Additionally, the bill calls on NASA to develop a plan for how it can best facilitate and support current and retired astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators to engage with K-12 female STEM students.  Although retired engineers, astronauts, scientists, and engineers are invaluable to inspiring the next generation of NASA scientists, I am especially glad and thankful to my colleague for including early career female astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators in this plan.

9671,topic-id,1415,"Madam President, I rise to speak on a subject that often goes overlooked in this body.  The subject of wasteful spending on parochial pet projects is often treated as a trivial matter--simply the cost of doing business around here. Imagine if every Member of Congress were as obsessed with searching for government waste as the players of the mobile game Pokemon Go are obsessed with finding the elusive Pokemon, as the chart shows here.  Just like the monsters in the popular game, government pork projects come in all shapes and sizes. They pop up just about everywhere. As individual expenses, these pet projects can seem rather harmless--cute, even. But taken together, their cost adds up to one very menacing boondoggle debt monster that continues to grow and threaten every taxpayer. In fact, within days, the U.national debt will top $20 trillion.  As we debate the budget resolution, we need to get serious about controlling the debt like the true national security challenge it is. We start by eliminating unnecessary spending and catching government waste.  My friend and former colleague Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma created an annual report cataloging some of the most egregious ways Washington wastes our tax dollars. It is called the Today, I am releasing the latest installment, which profiles 50 new examples of questionable expenditures. This year's edition is entitled ``Wastebook: PORKemon Go.''  Like the Pokedex, which lists the various Pokemon for players to catch, Wastebook provides an index of questionable expenditures lurking throughout the Federal budget. These collectively cost taxpayers more than $5 billion, but instead of Pikachu, we are looking out for PORKachu.[[Page S193]]  The top entry in this year's Wastebook is a spaceport--which is just a fancy word to say a rocket launch site--all the way over in It has been derided as space pork, not because it is launching an elite unit of porcine astronauts into the big trough in the sky, it is because Congress used earmarks to force the Department of Defense to build the facility, over the objections of the military, as part of an illegal kickback scheme.  A midlevel DOD employee, who was sentenced to prison for masterminding the plot, eventually confessed that building the launch facility ``doesn't make sense.'' He said the Pentagon ``just paid for meaningless work.'' Keep in mind, this was a contractor on that project. After sitting unused for several years, the Pentagon is now sinking another $80 million into the spaceport. This is despite the fact that it is not even equipped with the type of missiles that DOD plans to launch for the site.  Another entry, the National Comedy Center in New York must be laughing all the way to the bank with $1.7 million from the Economic Development Administration, or This will be spent to bring Lucille Ball back to the stage as a hologram. The three-dimensional illusion of Lucy is formed with light beams from a laser, which will replicate standup routines using existing audio recordings.  Holograms of other comedians who are no longer with us will also take the stage in the center's comedy club. Other features will include a boot camp on how to deliver jokes--maybe I need that one--as well as a heckle booth, which we can do without. This is likely to once again make Washington the punch line of jokes, but it is no laughing matter for taxpayers.  Next up, the U.Department of Agriculture, USDA, has a program that allows taxpayer-funded farm loans to literally be paid back with peanuts. This program shelled out $74 million in the past year. In typical Washington fashion, the government pays more for the peanuts than the market price, which has turned the program into a cash cow, or pig--however you want to view it--and the pile of surplus peanuts the government has amassed is so large that government can't even give it away.  Here we have a farm program where we are giving loans to farmers to grow peanuts. If they check at the end of the year and the market price for peanuts isn't very good, they can unload those peanuts on the government and keep the cost of the loan. Then, government has to store these peanuts, which we do in warehouses all over the country.  Based on USDA's own numbers, the Congressional Research Service is warning that the storage costs alone could pile up to $1 billion a year. That is not just peanuts; that is enough to make anyone salty about our debt and deficit.  Instead of filling potholes, $35,000 from the Department of Transportation literally went to pot. The money was paid for a giant glow-in-the-dark doobie displayed in Denver that was intended to remind motorists who smoke marijuana not to drive while they are stoned; $35,000 for a big poster or banner on a building of a giant joint.  Even the Nation's most prestigious science agencies are spending taxpayer funds investigating subjects that most of us would consider obvious or rather offbeat. Studies on the habits of college students funded with $5 million of NIH grants counted more than 500 different drinking games that are popular on college campuses.  According to researchers, ``All of these games have the same goal--causing participants to become intoxicated.'' I think that is rather obvious. They observed that fraternity brothers drink, smoke, and generally party more than other students, and they also sleep in later. This led the researchers to speculate that ``one explanation for this finding is that Greek students recognize their sleep needs.'' A more likely reason is that they are sleeping off their partying lifestyle, but you are paying for it.  NIH is also drilling down to determine why some people are afraid of the dentist as part of another $3.5 million research project. The researchers found that--surprise here--``fear of pain has been shown to be a critical component.''  The monkey business doesn't end there. NIH spent nearly $1 million to study the evolution of monkey drool and another $230,000 to determine if the color red makes female monkeys feel more romantic. In case you are wondering, it does.  As part of an effort supported by both the National Science Foundation and DOD to teach computers how to understand computer behavior, the machines were programmed to watch television shows. After viewing over 600 hours of ``Desperate Housewives,'' ``The Office,'' and other shows, the computers were still unable to predict how humans would behave in most situations. Anybody who has watched those shows realizes that is rather obvious.  A $1 million NASA project is preparing the world's religions for the possible discovery of extraterrestrial life forms--$1 million to prepare the world's religions for the possible discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. Do we need to spend that, really?  A major sticking point for the participants was defining what life is: ``Much of the discussion centered on the question, `What is life?' It turns out that life is notoriously difficult to define,'' they concluded.  The fishiest study of all tested how long a fish can run on a treadmill.

The experiment forced mudskippers to ``run'' for as long as 15 minutes at a time on a treadmill. These fish possess the unique ability to survive out of water for extended periods of time, using their fins like legs, although they didn't appear to enjoy running on the treadmill, as you can imagine.  Certainly, we have bigger fish to fry with our Federal research dollars and, I might add, better puns to find as well.

9734,topic-id,293,"Madam Speaker, our colleague on the other side of the aisle asked: Who the hell are we to be here speaking on this legislation and passing this legislation?  Well, Madam Speaker, we are the Representatives of the people of this country.  Madam Speaker, the most conservative estimates show that we have lost 54 million children to abortion since 1973. In a nation founded upon principles that recognize the dignity of every human life, we should not tolerate this extermination of innocent lives.                              {time}  1245  The majority of Americans recognize this tragedy for what it is, and there is consensus among them that they do not want their tax dollars paying for a practice they sincerely oppose, and we are their representatives.  Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has been included in relevant appropriations bills to prohibit Federal funding of abortions. Each year it has been consistently renewed and supported by congressional majorities and Presidents of both parties.  Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that the Hyde amendment has prevented hundreds of thousands of abortions each year. That means millions of Americans are alive today because of the Hyde amendment. After 40 years, it is time for this lifesaving amendment to become permanent law.  H.7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, makes the Hyde amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent and government-wide. This commonsense measure restores a longstanding agreement that protects the unborn and prevents taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of elective abortions.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to respect our Nation's consensus on abortion funding and affirm life by voting in favor of this rule and H.7.

9642,topic-id,1404,"Mr.President, I know the Presiding Officer is a fellow westerner, from a State that is impacted by decisions made by our public lands management agencies, whether that is the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Both Colorado and Arizona, as well as Wyoming and Utah--all of our Western States--are greatly affected by decisions that are made in Washington, In a conversation I had with the Presiding Officer from Arizona, we discussed the fact that 85 percent of the State of Arizona is managed by the Federal Whether it is the State or a Tribal entity or the Federal Government, about 47 percent is being federally managed. In the State of Colorado, about half of our State is managed by a public entity. Whether that is the State or a Tribal entity or the Forest Service, BLM land, the Department of the Interior, roughly half of the State is managed by the Federal Government, the State government or others. In other words, it is not in private landownership. So that means that the decisions made by these public land management agencies have a significantly outsized impact on our States than it does on States say east of the  So today I come to the floor to talk about one of those decisions made by the Bureau of Land Management's planning 2.0 rule. The discussion we are having today is about whether we should approve a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to stop the BLM 2.0 rule from going forward.  The Bureau of Land Management has over 245 million acres of public land. Almost all of those acres are west of the Mississippi River, predominantly in 12 The final BLM 2.0 rule is an example of how little Washington bureaucrats understand about the West and how little they understand about how the Federal Government and how Federal policymaking doesn't work when you try to take something they think of in Washington and put it on the people of the  It is the promulgation of this rule that actually led to my call for relocating the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC, and to put it in a place like Grand Junction, CO, because I believe it is important that we have public land managers and decisions about our public lands being made by those who are directly affected by that public land being in their backyard. If you live in the State of Colorado or if you are a county commissioner on the Western Slope, some of those counties have over 90 percent of their county managed by the Federal A decision made by that public land agency directly impacts them, not in a couple of weeks or months or next year but that very same day. To have somebody from Washington, DC, deciding a one-size-fits-all approach that is going to apply to a Western Slope county commissioner is just absurd. So moving the BLM headquarters to a place like Colorado or Arizona would absolutely result in better policies that work on the ground for our Governors, landowners, county commissioners, farmers, ranchers, cattlemen, energy producers, sportsmen, and recreationalists because they would be nearest to the lands that the decisions being made are affecting.  I hope we can move this country away from this ``Washington knows best'' mentality. That is why this resolution of disapproval is so important, because that is exactly what it would do, which is to remove ``Washington knows best'' by stopping the BLM planning 2.0 rule.  As it stands, I don't believe this rule should move forward. I have committed to Coloradans, to county commissioners, and to the people of my State that I will always have the goal to put more Colorado in Washington and less Washington in A county commissioner in western Colorado, from Dolores, Garfield, Grand, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Jackson, Mesa, Moffat, Montezuma, Montrose, or Rio Blanco County should have more say in decisions that are impacting their backyard on BLM lands than someone sitting behind a desk in New York They tell me that their ability to have an impact on their backyard lessens as a result of the BLM planning 2.0 rule. They believe they actually have less say under the new rule than somebody who doesn't live anywhere near their land or their State or their county or those BLM lands.  I believe that Colorado State and local leaders and local users should have a strong voice on local land management decisions. It is their backyard. Yes, it is public land, but the fact is they are the ones trying to make a living, trying to govern, trying to make decisions that are best for their constituents, and they should have a voice in those decisions.  I also firmly believe in managing our public lands under the multiple-use philosophy, which promotes recreation, grazing, and energy development with a balanced approach.  If the Congressional Review Act's resolution of disapproval on the BLM planning 2.0 rule is approved and signed into law, there will still be an opportunity to improve management and update policies at the Bureau of Land  I think that is one of the areas of misinformation that we see about resolutions of disapproval. There are some who support the BLM planning 2.0 rule, and there are some who have supported other rules that this Chamber has voted to disapprove through the Congressional Review Those people who support it sometimes get their facts wrong when they say things like: Well, if you repeal this rule, if you approve the resolution of disapproval, then there is no way that you can actually rule in this area again or make a[[Page S1614]]regulation that impacts this area of law again. That is simply not true. The truth is, when you use a resolution of disapproval, it simply says that we think this is the wrong rule that went forward through the executive branch agencies and we ought to use Congress--those people who understand the needs of their States better than a rulemaker in Washington, DC--to go forward with a new piece of legislation, a new authorization for a different rule. If we do that, then, we are going to have better policies because we have been able to account for every voice in the process, instead of leaving voices like those county commissioners, whom I talked about, out to dry.  I have told many recreationalists and sportsmen in Colorado that I am working with our Democratic colleagues and Secretary Zinke at the Department of the Interior on how we can move forward with the land management decisions and land use plans that take into account some of their concerns with this resolution of disapproval. There are updates and modifications that can be achieved, but they should all have stakeholder input. I don't believe that this planning rule 2.0 actually took into account all of the different stakeholders' views.  Working with some landowners cannot be at the expense of others. Right now, our cattlemen, farmers, ranchers, and county commissioners have severe concerns with BLM planning 2.0, and they feel as though they did not have a voice in the development of this rule.  I believe we can do better as elected officials and that we can give these local users' and landowners' interests a stronger voice in moving forward and that we can move forward together. So let's approve this resolution of disapproval that would claw back the BLM 2.0 rule. Let's make sure that local voices are given a place at the table. Let's make sure that county commissioners have influence over their area that is greater than somebody in New York City who doesn't live there. Let's make sure that we can protect the multiple-use philosophy of our public lands. Whether it is energy, recreation, or renewable energy, we have incredible opportunities on our public lands. But we can do better by working with Congress and taking into account every voice and making sure that we have a rule that is broadly supported instead of narrowly supported.  That is why I intend to support the Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval today, and I hope that my colleagues will do the same, as we truly find a bipartisan solution to give the people of our States a greater say over policies that affect their own backyard.

Please vote against Betsy DeVos because she's against      public schools. I'm happy here.

I love my school (PS3), and I hope you vote      against Betsy DeVos because she does not support public      schools. Sincerely,  These are just three letters out of thousands of letters, phone calls, and emails from my constituents. I have never heard so much from my constituents about someone so ill-prepared for the job they have been nominated for.  I am unconvinced that this nominee in any way would use her position to actually fight for the 2.6 million students and 200,000 teachers in the public schools in my  She refused during hearings to commit to protecting the Federal funding that goes to our title I schools which serve students from our lowest income families. She refused to uphold critical Federal laws, like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, in schools that receive this absolutely necessary Federal funding. She refused to commit to upholding title IX guidance from the Department of Education, which has played an instrumental role in addressing the problem of sexual assault in our schools across the country. She even wavered on whether guns have any place in and around our schools, she said she would oppose gun-free school zones. She doesn't have any experience working as a teacher or as a school administrator at any point in her career. Instead, she has spent decades advocating for education policies that would fundamentally undermine our public school education system.  What kind of message does this send to our students and their families and our teachers if we put our trust in a person who has worked so tirelessly throughout her career to weaken public schools?  I am astonished by how little the nominee seems to understand about the basic needs of New York's schools, teachers, and parents. I am very disturbed about how out of touch her statements are with basic values.  In New York, we have over 2.6 million students who attend public schools, including 450,000 with disabilities. We have over 200,000 public schoolteachers.  Ninety percent of all students in our country go to public school. Public schools serve all kids. They feed them if they show up hungry. Public schools help all kids with disabilities and don't send them somewhere else. Public schools help all students reach their God-given potential, and public schools are held accountable for meeting the requirements of our Federal education system and essential civil rights protections, but this nominee has vilified public schools.  Teachers and students around the country have raised their voices about this nominee, and they have made their views very clear. They do not want us to confirm Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education because they feel she is not an Education Secretary for all of I have heard from tens of thousands of them. Listening to what my constituents say, they are pretty concerned.  I would like to read a couple more letters. This one is from a school social worker in a middle school. She was hired to help underserved children develop effective executive functioning skills and survive their day-to-day lives.       My students are resilient, intelligent, loving young women      and men, and they face indescribable hardships that no child      should have to experience.       The ideologies and policies represented by Betsy DeVos and      the Trump administration put my students' futures on the      line.       Please continue to represent and fight for my students by      denying the confirmation of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of       Here is another letter:       While I teach in a private school setting, my sixth grade      daughter attends a public middle school, and my second grade      son attends a funded special education school to address his      speech and language delays.       We rely on the excellent public schools in our community to      support the learning needs of our children, as do hundreds of      thousands of other families in New York City and millions of      families across the  Here is another letter from a teacher in one of the poorest school districts in my He wrote:       I not only teach the State-mandated curriculum--we offer      elite educational programming to all those who reside in our      district.       I am honored on a daily basis to know that I have been able      to level the playing field for many students by offering them      the keys to success through their education.       Students who come to us homeless, underfed, victims of      poverty and trauma are given the same access to success as      those more fortunate.       Because of our public school systems, they have been able      to achieve the American dream and achieve all their dreams.  These are real concerns. These are heartfelt worries. This is what the people of New York are saying and people across this country. We need to listen to our constituents. We need to serve them. We need to represent them. We need to listen to our teachers across our States who work so hard every day to make sure our children can learn and reach their potential. We need to listen to our families and our students who have expressed very real fears that this nominee will cause damage to our public schools.  So I stand with my colleagues from both parties to oppose this nomination. I will not support the confirmation of someone who is such a threat to our public school system.

Forty-four years ago this week, before I was even born, the Supreme Court recognized that the government has no business coming between a woman and her doctor when it comes to making personal medical decisions. Yet now, decades later, many in Washington seem determined to turn back the clock on progress on women's health and women's rights.  The new administration recently instituted a rule that would limit the ability of women around the world to access accurate information about their bodies and make their own medical decisions. And now the House is considering a radical bill that would not only undermine a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, but also her ability to even choose her own health insurance plan. On top of that, the bill would actually raise taxes on small businesses who provide their employees with access to comprehensive health coverage and impose unfair burdens on the women of the United States military. These are the facts.  I will always fight back against efforts to limit choice in women's health, and that is why I strongly oppose this bill.

Tonight, millions of Americans, including myself, will tune in to the College Football Playoff National Championship between the University of Alabama and Clemson As with any college or professional competition, both teams will have healthcare practitioners traveling with them to the game.  Unfortunately, many States do not provide legal protection for sports medicine practitioners who travel with these athletes since they are not licensed to practice medicine in the secondary The Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, which I introduced with Mr.Richmond of Louisiana, would ensure that sports medicine professionals can provide high-quality and timely health care to athletes without having to worry about potential liability when traveling across State lines with their teams.  The nature of sports medicine professionals' jobs require them to frequently travel between States so that athletes can receive proper care the moment they are injured. However, providers are at great personal and professional risk because medical liability insurance does not cover costs for lawsuits related to care provided in States in which they are not licensed. It is not a reasonable solution to require practitioners to become licensed in every State where their teams will play during a given season.  This came to my attention, and I talked to a friend of mine who is an emergency room physician in Auburn, He travels with Auburn At the time, a few years ago, they were playing in what was then the BCS game. So here is a friend of mine, a physician, traveling with Auburn to the Rose Bowl in Fortunately, it didn't happen, but what if he had to take care of Cam Newton, who was the quarterback at the time? First of all, the players want physicians that know them taking care of them, but think of the liability because he was in California when he is licensed to practice in Alabama and if something had gone wrong to as valuable an athlete as Cam  It is important that we do this. It is just pure common sense. It is very bipartisan. My friend Mr.Richmond and I have worked on this together.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense, bipartisan bill to provide clarity for sports professionals performing their duties when caring for athletes. We passed this bill quickly last session. We are going to do it quickly again this Congress and give time for the other body to address this.

9749,topic-id,278,"Madam Speaker, I am just heart sick today to hear some of my colleagues talking about how they were celebrating the 44th anniversary of Roe v. That is 60 million babies--little girls, little boys--who have been aborted and no longer have a chance to live. We could have had perhaps a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's. Who knows what the potential of those 60 million lives could have been.  So it is hard to hear my colleagues talk about a celebration of that and using the terminology that this bill deals with abortion care. Abortion isn't care and abortion isn't services. It is taking a life.  This bill does nothing to change Roe v. Wade, although I wish it could, but it simply says that taxpayers do not have to participate in it. The taxpayers all across this country who believe that every life is precious work hard and send in their money every April 15. They entrust it to us, their elected officials. We have national security issues, we have roads, we have education. They don't want to see it go to something like taking a life through abortion.  So this is what we are doing today, simply making permanent a policy that we have had to put in as an amendment to appropriations every year and fight for. This is just making sure that, here in Washington, in America, the taxpayers invest in women's health care and are not investing in abortion.  We should be about saving lives, not taking them.

9584,topic-id,1373,"Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory of LaVell Edwards, a giant of the gridiron who guided the Brigham Young University football program through decades of unprecedented success. Surrounded by his family, Coach Edwards passed away peacefully on the morning of December 29, 2016.  Born to Philo and Addie Edwards in 1930 in Orem, UT, he excelled in football and basketball at Lincoln High  Following graduation, he decided to attend Utah State University to play football. LaVell figured that if he played for BYU, the hometown school, he would have lived at home and been required to milk the family cows, so he went north to At Utah State, he met the love of his life, Patti A few months after the two went on a blind date, they were married in Beaver Dam,  Following graduation, LaVell served in the Army for 2 years. After receiving an honorable discharge from the military, he became head football coach at Granite High School in Salt Lake  After eight seasons as head coach, LaVell was hired at BYU by Hal Mitchell in 1962. LaVell humorously remarked that he was hired only because Coach Mitchell wanted to run the single wing offense and Coach Edwards was the only Mormon running that offense at the time.  After 10 seasons as an assistant coach at BYU, he was promoted to head coach in 1972. Prior to his promotion, BYU had never achieved much success in football. In LaVell's words, it was a matter of when, not if, he would be fired. So he decided to do something that few other coaches were doing at the time: make the forward pass the focal point of the offense. LaVell's bold move revolutionized the game of football. His quarterbacks ended up throwing for over 100,000 yards, and four of them won the Davey O'Brien Award, given annually to college football's best quarterback. One of his quarterbacks even won the Heisman Trophy, which is awarded each year to college football's best player. LaVell's high-powered offense boosted the team to national prominence and culminated in BYU's 1984 national championship victory.  Following this historic season, Coach Edwards was named the AFCA National Coach of the With LaVell at the helm, BYU consistently finished in the top 25. He would eventually lead the Cougars to 19 conference championships and 257 victories, making him the seventh winningest coach in college football history. He coached 31 all-Americans, 6 College Football Hall of Famers, and 2 Outland Trophy winners. Coach Edwards himself was ultimately inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2004.  Despite his tremendous success on the field, LaVell always remained humble. He also never lost his sense of humor. Although college football fans typically remember Coach Edwards for his trademark sideline scowl, he was renowned for his wit. He quipped on this fact, saying, ``Someone once said I'm a happy guy; I just forgot to tell my face.'' With his disarming humor and clever one-liners, LaVell could lighten the mood and make almost anyone laugh.  Coach Edwards also had a remarkable ability to delegate. Although he knew football forward and backward, he surrounded himself with capable coaches and he let them do their jobs. His assistants were some of the best ever in college football, partially because he let them have free reign. This quality allowed him to focus on the personal element of football.  He valued all of his players, and by all accounts, his door was always open to them. Indeed, many of his players have spoken about having frequent meetings with him that helped change their lives for the better. At his funeral, hundreds of former football players showed up--Hall of Famers, top-notch-rated people in almost every case. I was there at the funeral on  Coach Edwards simply cared about people, and I was fortunate to witness this up close. In the 100th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with him when he was president of the American Football Coaches Together, we helped to pass legislation that allowed the AFCA to establish multiemployer pensions for college football coaches. Given the uncertain nature of the coaching profession, this legislation was an important achievement for coaches and their families across the country.  Although football was important to LaVell, his faith was first and foremost. While he was coaching at BYU, LaVell served as a lay bishop in a Mormon student congregation. He thoroughly enjoyed the interactions he had with those students.  Throughout his life, he served his church in many other positions of responsibility. Following his retirement from coaching in 2000, LaVell and Patti served a public affairs mission in New York City for the Mormon He served honorably in that capacity and even put his experience as a football coach to good use.  I might add that he invited me to come up and go to dinner with a number of dignitaries in that area so that he could chat with them and tell them a little bit about his faith and his beliefs, and it was a privilege to do so.  He and Patti were terrific missionaries and good people. While a missionary, LaVell aided in the establishment of Harlem's first high school football program in decades.  Coach Edwards and Patti also met with many different political and religious leaders, and, as he put it, they looked to ``build bridges'' between these leaders and his church.  Madam President, LaVell Edwards was a champion on and off the field. Not only was he one of the most successful coaches in college football history, he was also one of the greatest men I ever knew. I will be forever grateful for my own friendship with LaVell, and I pray that we will always remember the humility and humor that were the hallmarks of his life. It was one of the privileges of my life to have a personal relationship with him and They are two of the finest people I have ever met.  I have to say that LaVell would drop anything to support his religious beliefs, and he was a tremendous influence on literally hundreds, if not thousands, of football players and others who watched what he said, watched what he did, and loved how well he did those things.  I personally was befriended by him on a number of occasions, and it meant a lot to me. It means a lot to me to this day not because he was so important, he was one of the greatest coaches who ever lived, and he was in the Hall of Fame, but because he was down-to-earth, a person who loved to play golf, loved all sports, and loved being with people. And when he supported you, it was really support.  All I can say is, he is one of the greatest men I have ever met in my life. He had a great influence on so many people--still does. His wife is every bit as great as he has been. Both are tremendous human beings who have made this world a better place to live.  From a football standpoint, I think most coaches who knew him would say he was unexcelled, and I agree that is true, but that was minor compared to the type of life he lived, the type of things he did, the type of honors he shared, the type of kindness he showed, the ability to talk to people and help them through the problems they had, and, of course, the overall genuine goodness of a fellow whose life was well spent, who touched so many lives, literally hundreds of thousands of lives over the years, and who had this tremendous sense of humor that made being around him a real pleasure.  I am grateful I knew LaVell Edwards well. I am grateful for the life he lived. I am grateful for the example he set. I am grateful for the joy he brought to so many people. And I wish his dear wife Patti well. I just hope that these words will be a little bit of consolation for her.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Mr.Reyna was the last remaining survivor from Taos Pueblo of the Bataan death march.

The Bataan death marchers were forced to endure 3 and a half years of brutal captivity. They were marched for days in the scorching heat through the Philippine jungles. Thousands died.

9573,topic-id,2203,"Madam President, I come to talk about a topic that is near and dear to my heart. Although I don't serve on the committee of jurisdiction, I will tell some stories today that will demonstrate to you about why I feel so strongly about this nominee and so strongly about this position.  I want to start with my dad's story. My dad grew up on a small family farm outside the town of Barney, ND, not that you would know where that is. When he became an eighth grader--when he graduated with an eighth-grade education, he wanted to go to high school in Wyndmere, but as was the custom at the time, the oldest son was expected to stay on the farm and not get an education beyond the eighth grade and help support the family. That is not unusual. There is probably a number of people in this body whose parents have a similar experience, but this story really came home to me when my dad was diagnosed with melanoma.  Unfortunately, with part of that disease, the cancer moved to his brain and something remarkable happened for all of us, and that was that he would relive parts of his life. He would believe--as the cancer took over his brain, that part would activate his memory, and he would be doing things like calling bingo in the middle of the night during this time when he was in hospice care. It would alarm us, and maybe sometimes even amuse us, but he would[[Page S671]]truly believe he was calling bingo at the Mandan VFW  I remember taking care of him one night, when he started reliving the experience of not going to high school and started really talking about how that affected his life, begging his father. I would never have known that without the cancer, but that education experience was so critical to his future and the future of his children. That experience that he had taught us and informed us and mandated that we appreciate public school education and the opportunity that came with it.  That leads to our story, the seven children of Ray Heitkamp who had a great public school education in Mantador, went to high school in Some of my siblings were fortunate enough to go to parochial school before Francis closed down, but we all graduated from Hankinson High Then something truly remarkable happened in this country--truly remarkable because we had a chance to go to college. From the time we were just children, my mother would tell us we were going to college. We would wonder, back in the sixties, how that was ever possible.  Then the Federal Government did something truly remarkable. It said our most important asset and our greatest future lies in the education of our children, and we want to help our children advance with that education. We saw what happened with the GI bill when GIs came home from World War II and went to college and became doctors and lawyers, became bankers, became businessmen, and worked to build their communities. We saw that.  We said: Wouldn't it be great if every kid had that opportunity, not just returning veterans but every kid.  So I remember coming here, my first day that I presided in the U.Senate after I was elected in 2012, and I was so busy getting ready to serve that I hadn't really gotten to that spot where I realized: I am standing in the most deliberative body in the world, and I am a U.I remember gaveling in, asking Pastor Black to come forward and give the prayer, and then we turned--as the pages know, we turned to say the Pledge of It was at that moment when I asked myself, ``In what country can the daughter of a school cook and a construction worker serve in the U.Senate?''  We are blessed in this country to have opportunity, but that opportunity is diminished if we don't support public school education. That opportunity will not be available to future generations. We will continue to divide this country in ways that will destroy our democracy.  So where do we go today and how does this have anything to do with today?  This is our Nation's story. Public school education, which began in Massachusetts, and every step and every development of public school education has expanded the opportunity for children with disabilities to achieve their highest calling through public school education. Children of a school cook and a construction worker can become a U.Any achievement we all have is because someone cared about our education and cared about our opportunities.  I was fortunate, I had parents who believed in education. Way too many children today are in homes where education isn't a priority. Maybe that home is racked with poverty, addiction, huge challenges. Even homeless children deserve a public school education, deserve access to education.  We are the envy of the world. Children in other countries die for the opportunity for public school education. This is foundational, not just to the individual development but to the future of our country.  So where are we today? Sure, we have challenges in education. No one is denying that. No one is saying our public school education, our entire education system is perfect. The challenge I have in North Dakota is achieving quality education in a rural setting. How do we do that when maybe there are only two high school seniors, and if they are going to go to the next school, they are going to drive at least an hour and a half a day. That is not unheard of. I can only imagine what that looks like in  There are parts in our State where we are challenged every day to deliver high-quality education. We have a technology barrier. Fortunately, in North Dakota, we have technology and broadband in many of our schools. That is not true across this country. We need to do more in broadband, bringing high-quality education tools to schools. We need to recruit the best teachers for our rural schools, the best teachers for our urban schools--the best people.  During my time as Attorney General, I did a project involving juvenile justice. We went around to all of the schools, mainly talking to junior high kids because we believed that was the point at which they were making choices that may change the trajectory of their life. We were going around high schools talking to junior high kids. One of the things that kids told us over and over again is, they did not want their teachers to know when they had done something illegal. Why is that? It is not because they didn't trust their teachers with that information. The other group they didn't want to know was their parents because they didn't want to disappoint the heroes in their lives. Contrary to what people think--because they think children's heroes are some sports hero or some rapper or some performer, and that is absolutely not true. Do you know who kids' heroes are? First, they will say their grandparents or parents or a sister or a brother, one of their family members. Next what we hear is their third grade teacher, their seventh grade math teacher, their high school coach who maybe made their life a little bit easier when they were in school. Those are their heroes. These are the people who are doing the critical work all too often of helping to raise our kids in very challenging circumstances.  So when we do not support public school education with highly qualified nominees for the highest education job in the country, what does that say to people who may choose an opportunity in education? It says we don't think very much of them because we are just willing to go ahead with a D-minus applicant because maybe that applicant had a big checkbook.  I want to talk a little bit about my colleague who is on the floor today, Patty Murray, and a colleague who is not, and that is Senator I can state that I was in State office when No Child Left Behind was passed. It was so apparent to me and everyone at that level that this was not a public policy that was going to achieve the intended results, but yet we maintained that public policy for decades--through gridlock, through the inability to sit down and compromise, through the inability to put politics aside and put children first.  Then something remarkable happened in the last In a highly contentious partisan environment, two great leaders, Senator Murray and Senator Alexander, sat down, and they knew the time had come to reverse the No Child Left Behind Act and replace it with something that was going to be much more successful so the Every Student Succeeds Act was passed, and we are now on the path of implementation. We set a new policy for public school education.  We need a leader in the Department of Education who believes in public school education and who can administer that policy, who can leave policy to the local and State school boards, to parents, to PTAs, and to local folks. We want policy. We need someone who can collaborate and implement and work with schools across our country to make this policy work and then report fairly back to us when something is not working to tell us that wasn't a good idea. We need more afterschool programs. We need a hot lunch program that actually serves more kids in the morning so kids are ready to learn. That is what we need.  So what did we get with this nominee? In my opinion, we got a highly unqualified nominee for one of the most significant positions in government for our most precious resource, our children. That is what we got.  So I am standing today, explaining my belief that we need to do something different than approve this nominee. We need to send the right message to all of those educators, all of those State officials, and all of those parents who came together and worked with Senator Murray and Senator Alexander to form a policy. Dissent was hardly anywhere. If it was, it was whispered on the edges. We need somebody[[Page S672]]who appreciates that work, who understands that work, and who would never say public schools are a dead end.  Public schools are not a dead end. They are the beginning of opportunity. We have to work hard to make sure that happens, but we have to start from a foundational belief that public school education is critically important and needs to be protected, supported, and advocated for. We have to start there, and I think we are not there with this nominee.  I wish to say it is not just my judgment that I bring to the floor of the Senate today. I bring to the floor the judgment of thousands of North Dakotans who have called me.  Hopefully, I did something to give people greater access to my advocacy in the Senate for them. I opened a portal on my Web page and asked people to tell us what they wanted to have done with these nominees. I have received thousands--in fact, 4,600. It may not sound like a lot to other offices, but that is a lot from a State of only 730,000 or 740,000 people. Of those 4,600, over half were on this nomination. Of those who called this office or sent a message to the portal, 92 percent of them said: Please, do not vote to approve Betsy These are incredible statistics, very telling statistics.  I wish to read some of the comments I received from North I received a comment from Amber of Burleigh County, who said:       My husband and I are both public educators and we know how      critical a good public school education is for students all      across North Dakota, including our two daughters. We need a      leader at the U.Department of Education who supports      students, teachers, and public schools. Unfortunately, Betsy      DeVos wants to dismantle public schools.  Judith from Cass County said:       DeVos has no public education experience or training of any      kind; she has never been a teacher or school administrator,      served on any public board of education, or even attended a      public school. It is clear DeVos is not qualified to be the      head of the U.Department of  Patricia from Bottineau County told me:       As a former public school teacher and grandmother of 6, I      do not support Betsy DeVos for Secretary of She      should not get this job with no experience in education other      than trying to get rid of public schools.  An editorial today in the Fargo Forum, a very conservative newspaper in my State--I might say, it is not known for its liberal bias--said:       Of Trump's Cabinet nominees, DeVos is among the least      qualified for the intended job because of her uninformed and      ideologically skewed views of public education. Her ignorance      was on display during her Senate committee hearing during      which she was unable to answer even softball questions about      long-standing education policies.

9581,topic-id,647,"Madam President, why are we even debating the nomination of a person who clearly does not believe in our Nation's public schools? No matter whether you are a Democrat, Republican, Independent, no matter what part of the country you live in, whether rural or city, whether you have children or not, who would say that education is not important or valuable? Who would say that education is not foundational to success in life?  Nine of every 10 students in the United States attend a public school. Who among us would say those students should be led by a person who does not believe in public schools? Who among us would say that we should have an Education Secretary who does not commit to making public schools better for the sake of all of our children?  Then we should ask ourselves: Is Betsy DeVos the best that we can do for our children and young people? Does Betsy DeVos believe in public schools? Has Betsy DeVos ever been a teacher, a principal, or even attended public school? Does Betsy DeVos believe that we should hold charter schools--which are public schools, by the way--equally as accountable as other public schools? Does Betsy DeVos understand educational civil rights laws that provide all children with disabilities the opportunity to pursue a free and appropriate public education? Did Betsy DeVos commit to holding schools accountable for campus sexual assault? Again, I ask: Is Betsy DeVos the best that we can do for our children and young people?  Again, why are we even here to debate whether such a person should lead the Department of Education? I feel as though we are going down a rabbit hole where up is down and down is up. It should not be asking too much to have an Education Secretary who will stand up for public schools and the millions of our children and young people who attend our public schools all across our country.  Education is foundational. I think we all acknowledge that. I speak from experience. When I came to this country at almost 8 years old, I did not speak a word of I attended public schools where I learned how to speak English, developed my love of reading, and ultimately prepared for college. Public schools really helped prepare me for life.  I had a great sixth grade teacher. His name is Yoshinobu Before he was a teacher, Mr.Oshiro served in the military intelligence service during World War II, one of the segregated Japanese-American units that went on to earn the Congressional Gold He really cared about his students, and he encouraged me to study hard.  I have stayed in touch with Mr.Oshiro for decades. When I was last home in Hawaii about a month ago, I invited him to the historic meeting of President Obama and Prime Minister Abe of Japan at Pearl I wanted to make sure that Mr.Oshiro met both Prime Minister Abe and President This happened. Today, I have a photo of Mr.There he is, meeting President Obama on that historic day in  Mr.Oshiro was a very important part of my life. In public schools across the country, there are many more Mr.Oshiros, teachers who go out of their way to support and encourage their students. They deserve a leader who will fight for them, who understands the challenges our public schools face, and who is committed to meeting those challenges. They deserve a leader who wants all of our children in public schools to succeed. If you can truly say that Betsy DeVos is that leader, that she is the best we can do for the millions of children attending public schools in our country, then vote for her. But I cannot.

9647,topic-id,549,"Mr.President, the Bureau of Land Management has a mission set by Congress; that is, to manage the Nation's public lands under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, which means that public land should be open to everything, from hunting and grazing to energy development and other reasonable uses.  The BLM currently manages more than 246 million acres of land and 700 million acres of Federal and non-Federal subsurface estate. Much of these lands are in the West, where Federal acres coexist with private and State-owned land. In order to manage its resources effectively, BLM is required to provide resource management plans. This planning has typically been led by BLM's field offices, in coordination with State, local, and Tribal governments that provide local input on how best to manage the land and its unique resources. However, in the final months of the last administration, the BLM sought to apply a top-down approach, essentially a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to this resource management process. They termed it the planning 2.0 final rule.  The rule which was finalized in December changed how this planning is done and undermined the well-established process by limiting the ability of local input, public comment, and meaningful State consultation.  The final rule also pulled decision-making away from the regional BLM field offices and centralized it at BLM's headquarters in Washington, under the concept of ``landscape-level planning,'' which lets Washington define new[[Page S1616]]areas covering multiple The rule takes important decision-making away from local officials who know the land and understand the needs of their communities.  The BLM rule sought to ignore the multiple-use requirements established by Congress and diminishes the importance of energy development. The rule tilts the balance in favor of conservation and non-development and away from responsible energy development, as well as other uses, like grazing.  In a State like North Dakota, with a distinctive patchwork of underground Federal minerals and private or State surface ownership, this creates more uncertainty for energy producers and more difficulty for our ranchers. By repealing this rule, we are preserving our longstanding tradition of allowing multiple uses on Federal lands, while protecting the livelihoods of our ranchers, energy producers, and many others. That is why this resolution is supported by the North Dakota Stockmen's Association, along with the National Association of Counties, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the Farm Bureau, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Public Lands Council, and the U.Chamber of Commerce, just to name a few.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the CRA on the BLM planning 2.0 rule. I thank Chairman Murkowski, the chairman of our Energy Committee, for her leadership on this important issue.  The House passed this CRA on February 7 in a bipartisan manner. I am hopeful the Senate will do so as well and send this bill to the President's desk this week.  Today's CRA ensures that State, local, and Tribal input and expertise should guide the management of our public lands. Let's stop the BLM's planning 2.0 rule and give the people who live and work in these communities a say on what happens in their hometowns. We can do that by voting for this I urge my colleagues to do so.  With that, I yield the floor.

As hundreds of thousands of people swarmed this Capital, Boston Common, town greens from Wilton, New Hampshire, to Newport, Oregon, they sent a clear message to their government that when you treat any of us as less, you threaten all of us.

If this was a simple attempt to limit a woman's legal right to abortion or reproductive health care, that would be bad enough. But it is more than that.

9672,topic-id,2457,"Madam President, I rise this afternoon to supplement some remarks I made on the floor last evening about the Affordable Care Last night, I talked about my own experience as a young staff member in the U.Senate 43 years ago when, because I had an insurance policy provided by my employer--that policy had preventive care as part of the policy, just as Affordable Care Act policies do today--I had a routine physical checkup. It was the first I had in a number of years, which caught malignant melanoma, a particularly virulent form of cancer. Because it was caught early and because I was treated, here I am today.  As I mentioned last night, it has always haunted me that someone who didn't have insurance, a young man or a young woman somewhere in the country who was in exactly my situation, because they didn't have insurance, they didn't have preventive care, didn't get the checkup, the disease wasn't caught, and they are gone.  I find it very hard to justify that, to understand that. It doesn't seem fair. It doesn't seem ethical. It doesn't seem moral. Today I wanted to also bring to the attention of the Senate some stories from today about the effect of the Affordable Care Act in Maine, where we have over 80,000 people enrolled, many of whom had never been able to have insurance before.  A young woman, Whitney, who graduated from college in 2013, said:       I graduated . . . with a degree in wildlife ecology, [but      it was very difficult to find a job.]       Thanks to the ACA, I was able to stay on my family health      insurance plan through this period of unemployment. I did      finally get employed in my field, but permanent, year-round      jobs with benefits are the equivalent of winning the lottery.[[Page S194]]  Many young people are in that situation. It even has a name. It is called the gig economy, people who work gigs, who work short periods of time, several months here, several months there, but there are no benefits attached to those jobs. She said:       Many of us work seasonal jobs, building trails on the      Appalachian Trail, rescuing lost hikers, managing volunteers,      and running programs for veterans to reconnect with Maine's      woods. We do good work in this state. Before the ACA we      worked dangerous outdoor jobs that only provided minimum      worker's comp. . . . But with the ACA and the tax credit, I      could afford a silver plan, I could get dental for my teeth,      could go to the doctor again, get flu shots and get my joints      looked at.  It is important to realize that without the ACA, this young woman would have literally no options. A health savings account is unrealistic for somebody who is making $15,000 to $20,000 a year. Buying insurance across State lines isn't going to help this young woman.  She said getting the ACA coverage ``was life changing. I know it is not perfect but I am terrified of going back to [where we were] before, where health and financial ruin was one wrong step away.''  Another letter from an older adult:       My wife is sixty-three years old she is no longer able to      work full time. She has had major back surgery and has      arthritis in her neck. Because of these health issues she had      to reduce her work hours.  Here is the catch-22. She had to reduce her work hours. Therefore, her employer dropped her from her health care coverage.       We were fortunate [enough] to obtain coverage for her      through the Affordable Care It is expensive and is not      the best coverage--  Nobody in this body says it is best possible result and that the law is perfect. We all agree it needs to be repaired and fixed and modified. The writer goes on to say--     but it is good enough for us to know that a major health      issue will not bankrupt us.       We are appealing to you as our representative to insure      that a reasonable replacement will be put in place when the      Affordable Care Act is ended. Better yet, improve it, don't      destroy it.  I couldn't have said it better myself. Donald, in his letter to me, says: ``Better yet, improve it, don't destroy it.'' That is what we ought to be talking about.  This letter is from a fellow named Ryan in North Central He also makes an important point about the Affordable Care The term that I refer to is ``job lock.'' There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country who are locked into the jobs they have that they don't really like, that isn't giving them the satisfaction they want because they can't afford to leave their health care.  One of the hidden benefits of the Affordable Care Act is it has allowed those people to follow their dreams, to start a business and not have to worry about having health insurance. This is an entrepreneur in Maine, a small business person. He said:       Affordable healthcare is a major roadblock to those      calculating whether they can take the leap to become self-     employed. As we prepare for next year's ice cream season, I      am about to leave my benefit-providing job in order to commit      to making the volume of ice cream we need. This is a scary      and questionable decision given our financial situation and      the fact that we are raising our two small children of four      and seven years old. The first comment I hear from everyone      who finds out I am leaving my job is, ``Are you sure? What      are you going to do about health insurance??''  The answer is, the Affordable Care It enables this young man, this gentleman, to follow his dream, to start his business, to commit to his business, and this is good for the country. This is a hidden benefit that is rarely discussed about the Affordable Care Act to allow people to give vent to their dreams and their innovation and their contribution to the economy.  Here is how he ends his letter. He says:       Please don't let me down. Please don't let my family down.      Please don't let down the millions of families who really are      on the bottom of this country and are the very ones that all      of you from every party claim to support. I don't care about      the details of how it gets done, whether the ACA is thrown      out, or just revised, or what compromises have to be made by      either party, but please make sure there is a health care      option available and that it is at an affordable price for      those of us with the guts to take a stab at our own small      business. The key is ``Affordable Care.'' It matters.  As in my own case, health insurance also saves lives. There was a study done by the Journal of Public Health in 2009, which basically concluded that for every million people without health insurance, there are a thousand premature deaths. It is pretty easy math. Before the Affordable Care Act, we had 45 million people without health insurance in this country. The calculation in this extensive study was that 46,000 deaths were attributable to not having health insurance. I am living proof of that. If I hadn't had health insurance, I would be gone. With the disease that I had, either you catch it in time or you are a goner. That is why I am so passionate about this.  We would not let people die in our front yards. If we saw somebody who was in danger of losing their life, we wouldn't stand by. Nobody in this body would stand by and say: Sorry, we can't help you. But not providing health insurance to people is a death sentence to 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people.  The Affordable Care Act is now covering something like 25 million people. That is 25,000 lives saved. If we take it away, it will be 25,000 lives lost.  Here's the letter:       I am a Maine woman in my late 30s, who works 2 part-time      jobs and also run my own business.       Because we were on [ACA] health insurance that had an      affordable deductible, after not feeling well for a while, my      husband went to a doctor and had a CT scan of his lungs. . .      . It turned out he had a very rare form of an illness, even      though he was only 38 at the time. Had we not had this      insurance and such an affordable premium and deductible, he      would never have gotten that CT scan done. This insurance      saved his life and covered every expense we've had over the      last 2 years with multiple stays at MidCoast Hospital and      Maine Med, 2 surgeries, pick-lines, medications, therapies,      the list goes on. There is no cure for what he has but he's      doing better now, thanks to the  Another person from Maine:       My sisters and I watched my mom die. We were physically in      the room when it happened. We cried for probably half an hour      straight.       Before the Affordable Care Act, most of her illnesses were      considered pre-existing conditions. She survived cancer three      times . . . but had to pay exorbitant monthly premiums just      to have to pay most of her treatment out of pocket.  He said:       I don't care about the ACA because of some theory or      ideology. I watched my mom die, sooner than she needed to,      because she couldn't afford to get preventative care early      enough. I watched my mom die because market solutions refused      to solve her problems. An open insurance market actively      refused to compete to cover my mom. The insurance market      before the ACA is one of a number of factors that led to my      mom's death.       This is a real, physical, immediate memory for me whenever      someone talks about healthcare, and it always comes to mind      when people talk about it in vague terms and market forces. I      am crying even as I write this, and it has been years.  He writes to me:       I am begging you, as a son who watched his mom who was      younger than you--  Than me--     die in a hospital because she couldn't afford the care she      needed, please protect the Affordable Care Protect it as      a legislator, protect it by recognizing how appointments you      choose to confirm or deny will affect my family's ability to      stay healthy and alive. Through grants and research, you've      worked to improve access to health care. Please, protect the       Another one--one more. This is a letter I received just back in the fall, a little before Christmas:       I have an incurable, generally non-lethal form of bone      cancer and have been under treatment for over 12 years. The      multiple surgeries [and costs] . . . I cannot afford to pay      for ongoing treatment without insurance. I am very pleased      the current ACA does not allow for ``preexisting      disqualification'' and I would hate to see that removed.      Having this condition is naturally stressful, debilitating      and undesired. I do not want or need the added stress of      having to worry about the details of coverage.       Additionally I have two boys, aged 23 and 26, both of whom      have benefited from remaining on our family insurance policy.      That is a great policy and my boys are healthier as a result.       Finally, access to quality health care is and must be a      right as it benefits both the individual and society. Health      is key to happiness and success and happy successful people      pay taxes, support the government, [and] give back to the      community.  I understand the debate that surrounded this. I understand the emotion. I understand the pressure that people feel in order to maintain a campaign promise or to meet promises[[Page S195]]made over the last several years. But we are not talking about maybe what will happen; we are talking about real cases, real people. I am talking about real people in Maine, in small towns and cities. I am talking about rural hospitals that are on the verge of being rendered financially incapacitated because if this law is repealed, it will take away a significant part of their support. I am talking about seniors having to pay more for drugs. But mostly, I am talking about people's lives.  These cases are people who can give specific examples. There are thousands, tens of thousands, and millions that we can't articulate--people who are saved who don't even know it because they went in to get that checkup, who are saved the stress of wondering how they are going to pay for some kind of treatment.  As a parent, I remember having to stress about whether to take my child to a doctor because I didn't know whether I could afford to pay that bill. Yet we all know that is the proper course. We shouldn't have to make those kinds of choices. We have a vehicle, imperfect as it is. Imperfect as it is, we have a vehicle for providing that care.  Let's slow down. Let's take a breath and say: We talked about repeal, but it isn't really practical. We can't harm that many people. Let's talk about what we are going to replace it with. The idea that we are going to repeal it today and replace it 3 years from now is just cruel. That is what I am hearing from people: Don't put us through that. People who finally got insurance after preexisting conditions, who have insurance and have a condition now--they depend upon that insurance. Let's not make them go through that pressure, the financial anxiety added to the health anxiety. We have an opportunity to rise above politics. This really shouldn't be political or a policy or something that divides us.  There is nobody in this body who wants to see people suffer, who wants to unnecessarily put people through the pressure of both health problems and financial problems. We ought to be able to find a solution. Every other industrialized country in the world has found a solution. It is not like this is some impenetrable box.  I realize that part of the solution has to involve controlling costs and facing the fact that we pay twice as much for health care per capita as anyone else in the world. That is an issue the Affordable Care Act does not sufficiently address, in my view, and we have to talk about that.  In the meantime, let us remember those people who are counting on us for their very lives. That is a commitment I believe we can respect and should meet.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

9571,topic-id,3313,"Madam President, I rise to talk about what is going on in the Senate right now and the work that is done. It is early in the morning right now. It is 8 a.m. In Senate time, we have already done a series of votes that started at 6:30 this morning to be able to work through some of the nominations, and we have a great deal of work to be done.  In the middle of the work that we are taking on right now, there is a lot of conversation about personnel. As you know well, the Senate is in the personnel business as much as we are in the legislative business, especially at the beginning of a Presidential term. One of the biggest decisions that we will make in the Senate will be the Supreme  Americans voted last year, in great measure, about the Supreme Court--in the direction of the Supreme President Trump put out a list of 21 individuals he said he would choose from so the American people would be fully aware that this is the type of individual he would go after, and you can look at any of these to be able to evaluate it.  As I looked through that list of 21, one name stuck out to me. It is the name Neil Gorsuch, who is from Oklahoma, as many people in this Chamber know. Neil Gorsuch represents the Tenth He served on that circuit with great distinction, which includes We have been able to see his work in what has happened on the bench, the opinions he has put out and the consistency, how he has been respected by individuals on both sides of the aisle throughout Oklahoma and across the Tenth  Neil Gorsuch went onto the bench in 2006. He was put on the bench by President What is interesting is this body, when they debated Neil Gorsuch in 2006, unanimously approved him with a voice vote. Not a single Senator opposed Neil Gorsuch when he went onto that Tenth Circuit bench in 2006. That means at that time Senator Barack Obama supported him. Senator Hillary Clinton supported him. Senator Joe Biden supported him. Senator Chuck Schumer supported him in 2006. All these individuals looked at who he was, what he was about, and supported him going on the Tenth Circuit bench.  What has he done since that time? He has been a remarkable judge. He has advocated for something very clearly; that is, the role of each branch of government and each branch of government doing its job and only its job. He[[Page S669]]has spoken out on an issue I have spoken out on this floor about several times and oftentimes in committee, an issue called Chevron deference. It is one of those issues that most people don't track, but I hear a lot of people say the Executive orders are out of control and the executive branch is putting all these Executive orders out. I will typically smile at folks and say, actually, if you want to go down into the heart of it, it is not Executive orders, it is Chevron deference.  In the 1980s, the Supreme Court gave the ability to every President to interpret the law as they choose to and to be able to put regulations in if under this term they were reasonable in interpretation. In other words, if a piece of legislation mentioned a topic, then a President could create regulations around it.  It started slow, but I will tell you that has accelerated in the last several years. What has happened in the last several years is, Presidents have reached in, looked at a statute, tried to find a gray area of the statute, and used their deference ability to be able to interpret it.  In his writings, Neil Gorsuch has stepped out and said what that does, to be able to give that kind of deference to any President, is to give the President the ability to literally legislate an issue and then implement the issue and do his own interpretation of the issue. That is all three branches all piled into one. That is the President having the ability to say I am also the Court, I am also the legislative branch, and I am going to execute this out. That is a government out of balance.  What Judge Gorsuch has done is over and over again pushed out this basic judicial philosophy that our Nation was founded on three separate parts of government; that the legislative branch is the only branch that legislates; that the executive branch carries it out; and there is only one branch that interprets the law, and that is the courts.  If we were to move back to that simple model, it gives balance and consistency to all individuals to be able to know what the law says, what is the law, and to be able to actually push that out in such a way that people can trust it stays consistent.  I am proud to be able to sit down and have conversations with Neil Gorsuch in the days ahead. I am looking forward to getting a chance to meet with him in my office and to be able to work through other areas and issues he faces.  When President Trump selected Neil Gorsuch and suggested him for the bench, as I have mentioned before, my first thought was we couldn't have a better judge to be able to come out of the Midwest and to be able to speak out for the issues that real Americans want to be able to speak out for and to be able to have a Court that is consistently speaking, ``What did the law say when it was written? Let's just do that.''  There are a lot of other personnel issues that are in front of the Senate right now. Betsy DeVos is in the process of what is called a cloture vote right now for Secretary of That is final closing of debate and to be able to move to a vote that will happen Monday or Tuesday of next week.  I will tell you, there has been a lot of conversation about Betsy DeVos, and I have heard the debate on this floor and in conversations and things I have read. What is interesting to me is, to be able to hear person after person stand up and say she is not for public education.  Let me tell you where I am on this. Nine out of ten students in our Nation are in public schools. I grew up in public schools. My kids attend public schools. Many of my family members work in public schools or have worked in public schools. I am very passionate about what happens in our public schools because the vast majority of our students will be influenced and will be trained in our public schools. That has to be a primary focus of what we do.  What is interesting to me is, Betsy DeVos was very outspoken during her confirmation process about her support for public schools. Did her children attend public schools? No, they did not, as Barack Obama's children did not attend public schools, as many other wealthy families' children did not attend public schools. Many wealthy families choose to do that because they have that option. Betsy DeVos, though, has been a person to raise her hand and say: Why do only wealthy families get to choose where their kids go to school? Why is that? Why don't other families have the same option that wealthy families have? But Betsy DeVos has been outspoken in saying it is a main responsibility to be able to focus on the improvement of our public schools because, again, that is where the vast majority of our students attend school.  It has also been interesting to me that all of these statements against Betsy DeVos often don't take into account this basic thing: Betsy DeVos for decades has been passionate about trying to help students in the inner city, students who are in poverty--any student--to be able to have every opportunity in education they can possibly have. I would think that as a nation we would encourage that, and that would be a positive thing rather than a negative thing.  In 2015, this body looked at a public school education law called No Child Left Behind and said that the direction of public school education was going the wrong way. And for 15 years, we have had mandates coming down on our schools from Washington, DC, mandating what type of curriculum they use in their school, what kind of teacher evaluation is done for our public school teachers, what kind of testing requirement will come down on our schools. This body, with 85 of 100 voting for it, said that No Child Left Behind is putting Federal mandates on every school. The place where those decisions should be made is not Washington, DC; it is in local districts--done by parents, done by teachers, done by superintendents, and done by State legislators. That is exactly what Betsy DeVos has said as well.  Betsy DeVos has been very clear. She is not trying to promote every State and every district doing charter schools, allowing vouchers for private schools, allowing other options. That is completely the decision of the school. While I have heard people say that if she is put in place, she will take away all this money from the schools, it is not her role nor her capacity to even do that. She has been very clear in saying that all of those decisions are made by local districts and by State legislators and by parents--where the decisions should be made.  Betsy DeVos has been very clear that No Child Left Behind was the wrong direction. In a very bipartisan way, 85 Members of this body agreed with that 2 years ago. President Obama agreed with that 2 years ago. And we all said that the best place for education decisions to be made is at the local level.  Betsy DeVos was asked very directly: Will you go to these districts and try to impose on them to be able to put charter schools and private school access there? Her answer was: No, it is up to that local district what they choose to do--but nor would she try to stand in the way. If a local district or if a State chose to provide other options, it is not her role in the Federal Government to try to stand in the way of that. Quite frankly, I find it refreshing that someone would say: We are not going to run your school from Washington, What you choose to do in your schools, you are allowed to do.  Again, there has been a lot of conversation about charter schools and other options that are out there. I hear people all the time say that there is a problem with vouchers. How could the Federal Government be involved in any money going to private schools or public schools or whatever that may be? We settled that issue decades and decades ago. It is called the GI When the GI Bill was passed after World War II, the Federal Government told those veterans coming back from the war: You can choose to go to any school you want to go to--public school, private school, wherever it may be. The GI Bill is still considered one of the most effective tools that our Nation has ever done in higher education. It is a voucher program. And many people have not had the opportunity to think through: What does this mean?  Again, Betsy DeVos has been very clear in saying it is not her desire to be able to impose that on every State, but if a State chooses to do that, why would we stop them when we have already seen clear evidence that the GI Bill was already successful in its time, going back now 60-plus years? It is an[[Page S670]]issue that we look at and say: Why would we stand in the way of charter schools when, in the past, they have been very well received by Republicans and Democrats alike?  President Obama was a supporter of charter schools. Both of his Secretaries of Education were outspoken supporters of charter schools. In fact, one of them helped found a charter school. Charter schools are public schools, and they are received well.  In my State of Oklahoma, we just had another school that came online that is a charter school that has been approved by our State board of education in a unanimous vote just a few weeks ago. These are decisions that are made by local districts. These are decisions that don't work in every area, in every location, especially in many rural areas. It doesn't work the same way. So why don't you allow that local district to make those decisions? Why don't you allow that State to make that decision? Why don't you give the authority to Oklahoma to do it? Let's not ask Betsy DeVos; in fact, allow Congress to hold her to account to make sure that our Secretary of Education is not trying to impose on our States what she wants to do but is allowing our State to do what we want to do. What we ask of a Secretary of Education is not to run our schools but to stay out of our schools' business and to allow us to be able to make those decisions.  She is not going to step in and try to take funds away. Those are not her funds to give and to be able to monitor. Our decision is--what do we want to do as a State in education? What options do we want to provide to our kids? What I would ask most of a Secretary of Education is to leave us alone and allow us to do what we can for our kids.  Quite frankly, I don't have a problem with school choice, even as a parent who sent my kids to public schools when I could have sent them to private schools. I thought the school was doing a great job in my area. I was glad for my kids to be able to be involved in it.  But why would we ever tell a parent: If you will give us just 5 more years, we will get this school cleaned up and turned around. Their child doesn't have 5 more years. Their child has one shot. And if they wait 5 more years, they graduate from high school and without the opportunities they needed. It may work for their younger brother, but they couldn't wait.  Why don't we give that ability back to the parent? As an avid supporter of public education, as a person with deep respect for teachers in my school, as a person who--I myself have a secondary education degree from college; I spent 22 years working for students, and I cannot tell teachers enough: Thank you for your thankless service. They spend all day with students who don't want to be there most of the time. They deal with parents at night who are upset that their child got a B-plus rather than an And they work tirelessly through a lot of bureaucracy. We are grateful for that. I can assure them that this Congress will make sure that no Secretary of Education, including the next one, reaches into any classroom and tells them how to do their business.             Nominations of Jeff Sessions and Scott Pruitt  Madam President, we have a couple of others I want to mention, as well. Jeff Sessions, who is coming out of this body, will be the next Attorney He will be a great Attorney General because Jeff Sessions has proved over the years that he is passionate about the law. He did it when he was in He has done it here in the He has been an individual who is very focused: What does the law say? Let's do that.  He has been a person who is a lover of all people but also a person who is not opposed to confronting people when they need to be confronted. It is a good role for an Attorney I look forward to seeing him in that spot.  We have a favorite son in this fight as well. His name is Scott Scott Pruitt has been beat up a lot by the special interest lobbyists and environmental lobby. They put out all kinds of stuff about him. I encourage them to actually meet Scott Pruitt and to hear from him. Scott Pruitt has been passionate about the environment. Scott Pruitt actually likes breathing clean air. I know that may be shocking to people, but he actually likes clean air. In fact, he likes clean water as well. I don't know if you knew that or not.  Scott Pruitt has been a very good attorney general for us and has also been very focused on doing this one thing: What does the law say? Let's do that.  Some of the pushback that Scott Pruitt has had is not that he is opposed to the law; it is that he is not willing to push beyond the law, to be more creative with the Clean Water Act, and to be more creative with the Clean Air It is not the job of the executive branch to be creative with an old law; it is to implement the law and to do it well.  I fully expect Scott Pruitt to hold every person and every company that are polluters to account because we as a nation all want clean air and clean water. But I also fully expect him to push back when someone says to him ``You ought to do this,'' and for him to respond ``That may be nice, but that has to pass Congress because the Environmental Protection Agency can't make up the rules; they can only implement the rules that have been given to them by Congress.'' I am looking forward to Scott Pruitt serving in that role.  In the weeks ahead, as he has advanced out of committee, he will come to the floor, and we will have a full vote here. I am willing to tell all of my colleagues that when Scott Pruitt is at the Environmental Protection Agency, you will be pleasantly surprised with how fair he is, how responsive he is, and how passionate he is about actually implementing the law.  These are long days for us because there are an awful lot of stall tactics going on. President Trump is trying to put his Cabinet together. By this point, 2 weeks in, President Obama had almost all of his Cabinet done already. Over 20 individuals were already in place in President Obama's first term. The other party has blocked as many as they possibly can so that President Trump can't get to work. You may think that is a nice political thing to do, but the Nation had an election. And as President Obama said, elections do have consequences.  President Trump should be allowed to put together his Cabinet just as Republicans allowed President Obama to put together his Cabinet before. It is a fair thing, and it is the right thing to be able to do. We all need to be able to get our work done, President Trump included. Let's let him put his team together and get to work as the American people have asked him to do.  Madam President, with that, I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

9506,topic-id,883,"Mr.President, this week, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is in Washington where he is meeting with President Trump and other senior administration officials, as well as some Members of  President Trump has spoken glowingly of President el-Sisi, as he has of Russian President Putin and Philippine President ``Strong leaders,'' he calls them, as if that is enough to justify our wholehearted support. Unfortunately, world history is replete with examples of strong, messianic leaders who abused their power in ways that caused immense hardship for their people and divisiveness and conflict in their countries.  Despite that, the White House has voiced its strong support for President el-Sisi, and for U.S.-Egyptian relations.  I have been to Egypt many times, and I have voted for billions of dollars in U.aid for Egypt to support economic and security programs in that country. I have recognized positive developments in Egypt when they occur, such as President el-Sisi's decision to undertake economic reforms, including by reducing some subsidies. Far more needs to be done, however, if Egypt's economy is to break free of decades of state control, endemic corruption, and gross mismanagement.  I am also aware of the security threats Egypt faces in Libya and in the Sinai, although I and others have expressed deep concern with the flawed tactics the Egyptian Government is using to combat those threats. The U.has an interest in helping Egypt confront these challenges by addressing the underlying causes in a manner that is effective and consistent with international law.  President Trump has called President el-Sisi a fantastic guy. Ironically, that says a lot more about President Trump than it does about President el- President el-Sisi, a former general who seized power by force, has ruled with an iron fist. He has effectively banned public criticism of his government since the removal of former President Morsi, enforcing what amounts to a prohibition on protests and arresting hundreds of people in connection with the ban, many preemptively.  President el-Sisi's government has engaged in one of the widest arrest campaigns in the country's modern history, targeting a broad spectrum of political opponents. Local civil society organizations estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people are detained on political grounds, such as for protesting or calling for a change in government. Police have accused many of having links to the Muslim Brotherhood, usually without evidence that they have advocated or engaged in violence. Many other detainees belong to other political organizations or have no party affiliation.  A systematic crackdown on Egypt's independent civil society has left it on the verge of collapse. According to human rights groups, nearly every prominent Egyptian human rights defender or civil society leader is banned[[Page S2212]]from leaving the country as part of a judicial investigation into the foreign funding of their organizations. A law signed by President el-Sisi in 2014 would allow prosecutors to seek 25-year sentences for illegally receiving foreign funding. Parliament has also proposed a new law regulating civil society organizations which, if adopted, would effectively outlaw independent human rights work in the country.  Despite repeated requests by U.officials, including some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, President el-Sisi's government has refused to release those detained for political reasons for months or years without charge or on trumped up charges like Egyptian-American citizen Aya  The media has also been targeted, with authorities threatening and jailing journalists who reported on political opposition. Some foreign journalists have been barred from the country after writing articles critical of the government. As of December 2016, Egypt was the third-highest jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect This pattern of harassment and arrests is not new. It has been happening for years, and, contrary to the representations of Egyptian officials, it is getting worse.  According to Human Rights Watch, members of the security forces, particularly the Interior Ministry's National Security Agency, routinely torture detainees to elicit confessions. This torture usually occurs during periods of enforced disappearance that can last for weeks or months. The widespread use of torture has also been reported by the State Despite hundreds of reported cases of torture and enforced disappearance, since 2013, only a handful of police officers have reportedly been punished for violating the law.  According to information I have received, prison conditions remain deplorable, and political detainees are beaten, often deprived of contact with relatives and lawyers, and denied access to medical care.  The government's use of U.aircraft and other military equipment in its counterterrorism campaign against a local ISIS affiliate in the northern Sinai has not only resulted in indiscriminate attacks against civilians and other gross violations of human rights, it has made the terrorism situation worse. Requests by myself, as well as State and Defense Department officials and by independent journalists and representatives of human rights groups, for access to conflicted areas, have been denied.  While President Trump and other U.officials unabashedly praise President el-Sisi, I wonder how they reconcile their portrayal of him with his crackdown against civil society and brutal repression of dissent. In fact, it can't be reconciled, and it damages our own credibility as a strong defender of human rights and democratic principles.

9669,topic-id,1224,"Mr.President, the 115th Congress convened just last week. I had hoped that with all the turmoil in the country that we would begin the year with a renewed sense of cooperation. But I am sorry to say, my friends in the Republican Party have chosen a different path.  The very first thing on the agenda is to press forward with a sham budget. If you ask why we have a sham budget, a fake budget, an unrealistic budget--we find out that its only purpose is to set up a process to repeal the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority vote. Why? Because they know the American people would never allow a repeal to pass otherwise.[[Page S192]]  So instead of working to finalize appropriations bills for this year--already more than 3 months in--or to invest in our Nation's critical infrastructure, or to truly bolster our Nation's cyber security, when we see countries such as Russia and other places attacking our cyber systems, or even to improve the Affordable Care Act so we can ensure that more people can receive affordable coverage, I am afraid the Republicans are recklessly rushing forward solely to fulfill an ill-considered campaign promise.  They are pushing American families over the cliff with the vague promise: Yeah, we will repeal it, but don't worry because eventually we will come up with a plan to replace it.  Jump first, plan later is anything but a responsible formula for someone's health, for sound decisions; and all the more so when the health insurance of tens of millions of Americans and American families all over the country--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--is at stake.  The majority leader and others have said the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is only the first step. They say that a full repeal is necessary to pave the way for a replacement. They say: Let's leave ObamaCare in the past. Well, when you strip away the rhetoric and get rid of it, the only alternative they offer the American people is don't get sick--because if you get sick, you are in trouble.  The American people have a right to know what a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act really means. A repeal of this law would not just take away the rights and care of millions of patients and their families; it would eliminate insurance coverage for millions more--especially the aging, the elderly, men and women with preexisting conditions, and the most vulnerable children.  A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would turn back the clock to a bad time in this country where once again women would have to pay more for health insurance than men, where insurance companies could rescind a health insurance policy simply because someone gets sick, and coverage could forever be denied to someone born with a disease or ailment, and that includes children. So you could buy a health insurance policy so you were covered in case you got sick, but the insurance companies could then say: Oh, you are sick. Sorry, no more insurance.  Now, in my State of Vermont, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the number of Vermonters without insurance by 53 percent. Tens of thousands have gained coverage under the expansion of And because the Affordable Care Act closed the prescription drug ``donut hole,'' more than 10,000 Vermont seniors saved $12 million in prescription drugs in 2015 alone. And this is just in the second smallest State in the Can you imagine what it is like in larger States?  I have heard stories from many Vermonters about how vital this law is to them and their families. I have heard from family doctors, like one in the southwest corner of our State in Bennington, who remembers when his patients couldn't afford treatment because of lifetime and annual limits on health care coverage, something that was very common. Or a woman from Westminster, VT, whose family hit hard times--she moved from job to job. She couldn't afford continuous health coverage until the Affordable Care Act offered her a quality plan she could keep. Now, we are talking about throwing her off.  Other young Vermonters are able to pursue careers in public service or the arts because they can stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26. Countless others have underscored that because of previous health issues, such as diabetes or cancer, health coverage would otherwise be unaffordable.  It would be a vicious cycle. They had a disease, but they couldn't afford to do anything about it, and they would go into greater debt. Now, even though they have a preexisting condition, they have guarantees and subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act so they can have health coverage, instead of health coverage being unaffordable.  Opponents of the Affordable Care Act have gone to new lengths to repeat and prolong this political battle. And that is all this is. They have had 6 years to propose a better alternative. Instead, congressional Republicans and the President-elect have decided to put the cart before the horse. They want to dismantle our health care system, and they don't want to figure out how to fix it. They just want to figure out how to get rid of it. And, by the way, they say somebody is going to come up with a bright idea for something better.  The American people rightly expect us to work together and make progress on the many challenges that we face today. Instead, we are engaging in dangerous political gamesmanship that will not affect Members of the Congress, but the millions of families we represent throughout this country because they will not have health insurance, and their children will not have health insurance. Just think what this is eventually going to cost Americans--a lot more than we pay now.  I will not support a return to less protection, less coverage, less fairness, and higher costs because that is what a repeal means. The Affordable Care Act extended health insurance to millions of families, not only in Vermont, but across the country. Those who represent the American people in Congress should stand ready to get to work for their constituents. Not to make their constituents sick, but to give them a program that works.  I will not support an effort to reverse the many reforms and achievements we have made through the Affordable Care Act and instead cobble back together a broken system that for too long burdened most American households with health coverage uncertainty and crippling costs.  I am not going to go and tell Vermonters: Too bad that you have cancer. We just fixed it so you can't have insurance. Too bad that you have diabetes. We just fixed it so you can't get insurance. Too bad that your child was born with a physical defect. Too bad. We just fixed it so you can't get insurance. Or to the person who just lost a job who doesn't have insurance: Too bad that you are without health insurance. Better pray you don't get sick because, if you do, you will lose a lot more than your job.  No, I can't look Vermonters in the eye and say that is what I support.

On Saturday, I joined millions of women, men, and children who took to the streets and raised their voices in defense of equality. We marched because women's rights are truly human rights. We marched because women should be able to make their own choices about their own bodies. We marched because everyone deserves health care, not just the privileged few.  And yet, here we find ourselves voting on another Republican attempt to cut off reproductive health care from the people who need it the most. H.7 would be devastating for all women, but would disproportionately impact low-income families, women of color, immigrants, and young people.  But we were reminded this weekend that, as women, our destinies are tied together, and we will not be silent as Republicans attempt to interfere with a woman's constitutional right to choose.

9637,topic-id,2314,"Mr.President, I am pleased the Senate is at the point we are this morning. Last night, we agreed to proceed to consideration of H.44, which will overturn the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0 The House has considered this already. They passed this resolution on a strong bipartisan basis. It was a 48-vote margin. They did this just before the February recess, and so it is now in front of the  As the sponsor of the Senate version, I have come to the floor now to explain to colleagues why this BLM Planning 2.0 Rule is such a bad rule and to urge its nullification.  There are probably a lot of folks that are asking the question: BLM Planning 2.0, what is it? It is not just folks that are listening, it is colleagues here. What exactly is Planning 2.0 and what exactly does Planning 2.0 do? A lot of people are saying: I never heard of this one. Where did it come from? Based on that, I think a lot of context is in order as we begin this debate.  The Bureau of Land Management is a Federal agency that manages 245 million acres of land in 12 Western States, along with 700 million acres of Federal and non-Federal subsurface estate.  Congress has directed the BLM to manage those lands according to the Federal Land Policy and Management That is too long to say. So we just refer to it as It serves as the agency's organic act. It mandates a multiple-use mission for BLM lands. I think it is important to always remember that. BLM is required to manage under the concept of multiple use. It lays out a planning process for its mission. It establishes a special status relationship between the Federal Government and the States and the local governments that are affected by the agency's resource management plans.  I think it is important, as we are focusing on the BLM right now, that we remember that BLM lands are not national parks or wildlife refuges. They are not wild and scenic rivers or wilderness. BLM lands are working lands. They are valuable--not because they might contain a Mount Denali, like up north, or the Grand Canyon--but rather because these lands contain energy and minerals and they can be used. Again, this is the multiple-use concept. They can be used for grazing. They can be used for recreation and many other purposes.  They are valuable in this way and as such are a leading source of good jobs for families and communities all across the BLM's management of western lands has never been without controversy. That is part of the reason that the last administration decided to overhaul the regulations that guide the planning process. The stated goals from the administration were to create a better process that would increase transparency, increase public involvement, and reduce the amount of time it takes to develop a resource management plan.  So those clearly all sound like good ideas, good goals. Unfortunately, the reason we are here today seeking to overturn this planning 2.0 rule is that[[Page S1610]]the BLM absolutely failed to achieve any of those three goals. Instead of greater transparency, BLM delivered a new process that ensures less transparency. Instead of expanding public participation, Western States are looking at fewer and weaker opportunities to influence the management of local lands.  Planning 2.0 also turns the relationship between federal, state, and the local governments on its head. It just really turns it upside down. What actually happens then is that it has effectively subverted FLPMA, shattering the special status arrangement that the West is supposed to have under the Federal law.  As a Senator for the State of Alaska when this rule came out, I looked critically at it and I have problems with many aspects of the rule. I know I am joined by nearly all of my western colleagues and many who are not from the West but who have taken the time to understand how our land management laws are supposed to work and who have looked critically at this rule.  The more my staff and I have unpacked the Planning 2.0 Rule, the less we like it and the greater is our conviction that this rule should be overturned through the Congressional Review That is why we are here. I could go on for quite some time, but for purposes of this statement, I will list this morning my four main criticisms, all of which compound each other and show why this rule must be repealed.  First of all, Planning 2.0 seeks to transition to a landscape-level approach for land management planning. It is not a bad concept on its own, really. I don't have any problem with BLM determining, for instance, where our solar resources are located, but to make that a defining measure and to make that a defining feature of a resource management plan is a bad idea.  It all but assures that new and revised plans will not have the level of detail or specificity that is needed to properly manage our local resources. It allows for planning areas to cross State lines without regard to the competing priorities of neighboring It does not ensure that existing State and local plans will be consistent. It is very obvious that BLM will deploy it as a mechanism to reduce or perhaps to eliminate many reasonable uses of Federal land that provide jobs and support communities all across the  The second criticism I have is that Planning 2.0 allows BLM officials to remove the decisionmaking authority from our field offices and our State directors, and it tends to centralize that power at BLM headquarters. So for those of us in the West, we are looking at a situation where effectively the management decisions of our land are being taken from those who are on the ground, people who really understand the conditions and are those who are most impacted by it. It shifts it back East to be decided by those who don't have that same local understanding, who might not really have any understanding as to the areas and why this is so important.  So centralizing power at BLM headquarters, in my view, is never the right direction. I am not suggesting that this is going to happen every time with every decision. However it could happen at any time, whenever a future administration decides that a decision needs to be made at the headquarters level rather than locally. So now, at a moment's notice--perhaps without even any notice at all--decisionmaking authority can be taken away from a Western State with expertise and effectively siloed here in Washington, That is not the direction to be taken.  The third area of concern I have is that Planning 2.0 reduces the ability of western stakeholders to provide input into the land management process, as well as their stature within it. So, again, it compounds the fact that you are shifting decisionmaking authority back here to the By further limiting stakeholders' input, that is very problematic.  Now, the agency has talked a good game about public participation. But if you read the rule, what it effectively does is just kind of front-load public input while cutting later opportunities for feedback. If left in place, Planning 2.0 would ensure BLM would be able to maximize its decisionmaking power while at the same time effectively sidelining input from Western  We previously were in a situation where western stakeholders had a seat on the stage before this rule, but under it they are really demoted. They are effectively demoted to a middle row in the mezzanine as part of a bigger crowd, but with no special status. I think it is important to keep that in context.  The fourth area of concern is that BLM 2.0 weakens and eliminates the requirements in FLPMA that require BLM to coordinate planning and resource uses with our States and local governments. Under this rule, BLM shifts the burden for making sure that resource management plans are consistent with State and local governments plans away from itself and onto the States and onto the local governments. That is not right.  The agency is also limiting the opportunities that those government have to identify and remedy deficiencies within and across plans wherever they may be found.  So here are a couple of examples this morning for the Senate, just to illustrate why so many of us are concerned about this and are opposed to Planning 2.0. You have to ask yourself: Is it fair and is it really what Congress intended, for a western stakeholder to have the same voice and influence over the management of their local lands as any other member of the general public from anywhere else, with no connection, no relationship to these areas?  To be more specific, should a small placer miner in Chicken, Alaska, or a cattle grazer in Nevada be relegated to the same status as a lawyer in, say, Vermont who has never visited either Chicken, Alaska, or rural Nevada? My answer to this is pretty easy. It is a simple no. But that is what awaits us under Planning 2.0.  So here is a real world example of what Planning 2.0 will mean on the ground. Last year, the BLM finalized a resource management plan for 6.5 million acres of eastern Interior Much of that plan was developed in accordance with the principles of Planning 2.0. So what does it actually look like for us up there in Alaska, in the eastern Interior area?  The plan closes nearly three-quarters of the 40-mile district, where the only economic activity, really, is placer mining--small placer mining. They closed it to mineral entry. More than 1 million acres are withdrawn into what they call ``areas of critical environmental concern''. This is a land management tool that BLM has used more and more in recent years to sidestep Congress's sole authority to designate Federal wilderness.  So the agency sought public comment, but it was limited public comment. Then it effectively ignored the comments that it did receive. Ultimately, very few Alaskans were able to participate in the development of the plan, and even fewer Alaskans are happy with the final outcome of the plan. As we expected and as we feared, the Planning 2.0 process was used to shut down a reasonable use of Federal land that the last administration just did not like. This was done even though it enjoys overwhelming support among local residents who really depend on it for their livelihood.  The Planning 2.0 process was also used to close off Federal lands to the public in violation of the ``no more'' clauses within ANILCA, or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, even though there was no imminent threat or reason to do so. So, as colleagues are considering how they will cast their vote on this resolution of disapproval, I am sure, again, that many had not really focused on this Planning 2.0 before. Most of them would never be able to find Chicken, Alaska, on a map, and they are thinking: This is not going to impact me. I am not from the  But for those of us in the West, if you live in one of the 12 Western States that have BLM land, believe me, you are impacted. I would suggest that what we are seeing, starting in Alaska, is something that simply won't stay up there. If this rule is allowed to remain in place, you will see that move through all of our Western  BLM maintains and periodically revises dozens of resource management plans in its 12 Western states. So if Planning 2.0 stays on the books, I think what it will do is it will harm our Nation's energy producers. I think it will harm our mineral developers. I think it will harm those who rely on[[Page S1611]]Federal lands for grazing. It will most certainly cost us jobs. It will cost us economic opportunity, and it will hurt the communities and the people of our Western  I would ask that you don't just take my word for this. Six counties from six different States have challenged this rule as impairing the informational and coordination rights of local governments. They believe that it violates FLPMA and that BLM has failed to properly evaluate the impact that it will have. I think they have a very strong case. This is a fatally flawed rule. Our best option is to overturn it while we have the ability to do so under the Congressional Review Act and to hold BLM accountable to the underlying statute and its multiple-use mission. If we can agree to do that today, we can then work with our new Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, to make genuine improvements to the BLM land management planning process. I know that Secretary Zinke cares about our public lands. He understands these issues, and I think he is dedicated to ensuring that we get this right.  I would like to close by thanking the roughly 80 stakeholder groups that are supporting our disapproval resolution. I also thank the 17 Senators who are cosponsoring the Senate version of it. I thank the new administration, which has released a statement of policy in support of it. I also acknowledge and thank Representative Cheney and Chairman Bishop in the House, who led the resolution through the House with good bipartisan support a couple of weeks back.  It is now the Senate's turn to act on this. It is our turn to recognize why this rule deserves to be overturned. For the good of our Western States, let's send this disapproval resolution to the President's desk.  With that, I again urge the Senate to support House Joint Resolution 44.  I yield the floor.

It is a principle so many of us care about. I have heard passionately from so many of my colleagues here today about what public education means to them, what it means to our country, what it means to our[[Page S678]]democracy, and what it means for kids of all different backgrounds to come together in a public education system that is guaranteed by this country. The dangerous views of this nominee, Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education--who has said repeatedly she will not protect the investments we have made, but rather has the philosophy that we should take money away from our public education students and put it to vouchers for private schools--will undermine our whole entire democracy. It is why we have heard across this country from so many parents and teachers and students and grandparents and business leaders who are urging Senators from every State to vote no on this nominee.  Certainly we can do better. Certainly the last election was not about sending our K-12 and higher education system into chaos, certainly not at a time when one of the most important things people care about is the stability of our economy, the ability to get a job. Fundamental to that is being able to know you can go to a school, no matter where you are or where you live or how much money you have, and get a good education. We need to keep that, and no one wants to send that system into chaos at this time. That is why people are speaking out.  As I mentioned earlier today, I have heard from thousands of people in my home State who have contacted me with concerns about this nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the Secretary of An overwhelming number of them are people who have spent time in our classrooms with our kids; that is, our teachers. Many of them have spent decades in public schools dedicating their own lives to helping our children learn in school districts of all different sizes, and those teachers deserve a voice today.

A retired teacher from Mercer Island asked me to oppose this nomination. She has spent 37 years teaching children in our public schools.  On the other side of my State, in Spokane, a 28-year teaching veteran says strengthening public education is the best thing we can do for schools like hers that are located in a high-poverty district.  In Prosser, a public school teacher and a former lawyer told me that he is committed to both the public education system and the He called the nomination of Betsy DeVos an affront to both, given what he called her track record of undermining public schools and the need for separation of church and He said that only through access to high-quality learning opportunities can we remain free.

In Monroe, WA, a teacher for 35 years says she is afraid of what DeVos could mean to public education.  From Camano Island, a retired teacher of 31 years said all children deserve the same access to high-quality public education.

They have done so in committee on an admittedly controversial bill.  I don't expect every State and city to agree with the District of Columbia on matters affecting our city.

In order to do so, two doctors have to have found that the resident does not have more than six months to live, among other requirements.

I pay tribute to former Representative Tom Davis, who, in the majority, sponsored a bill with me to get a House vote, only a House vote for the District of This was a very important effort strongly supported by the residents of the District of Columbia to say: look, you don't give us statehood, let us get there gradually, give us the House vote.[[Page H1525]]  Tom Davis saw that Utah did not have the House vote because their missionaries were not counted by the census, and they had expected an additional House The Governor of the State and the State legislature supported the action and most States have used similar bipartisan action to come into the  This, of course, would have been only a House vote; one for very Republican Utah, one for Democratic D.This bill was passed in the House--thank you, Utah--and was passed in the  And the only reason the District of Columbia does not have a vote, as I speak, is because the National Rifle Association was able to place an amendment on the bill that, in the event D.got a vote, would have eliminated all of our gun laws, each and every one. A big city without gun laws, of course, is open territory, and we were left with the woeful and shameful option of giving up our vote, a vote we could have had.  We also have tried, short of statehood, to get budget autonomy.  Imagine bringing our budget, raised in the District of Columbia, $7 billion, and asking Members who don't know anything about it to vote on it. That is what the residents of the District of Columbia have to do.  I pay tribute to the former Republican chairman of the House committee of jurisdiction, Oversight and Government Reform, Darrell Issa, who held a hearing when he chaired the committee on D.C.'s local matters, including its local budget.  Upon hearing the testimony about this district's financial conditions, its reserves, its growth among the best of the Nation, upon hearing in testimony from the Mayor, the city council, the chief financial officer, despite meeting those marks, then-Chairman Darrell Issa supported budget autonomy for the District of Columbia, and worked tirelessly for this goal during his chairmanship of the Oversight and Government Reform  So I am not here to say that there is no sense of a necessity to have something done, as you see that in former Chairman Darrell Issa's actions.  For that matter, Chairman Jason Chaffetz, last week, called for the District of Columbia to be made a part of Maryland in order that it would get Senators and He wasn't joking. He wasn't making fun of us.  There has long been a small group of Republicans who acknowledge the shame of having almost 700,000 Americans without representation in the House and the And one of the easier ways to get it, they think, is to retrocede, that is the word, because the District was created out of Maryland and Virginia itself cast off, the District of Columbia because it was afraid Congress would abolish slavery. So the notion is, go back to  My first notion or response is: Have you asked Maryland? In other words, you don't decide to reconfigure a State with a big city, and Maryland has only one big city, because you are fulfilling one value without fulfilling the other value, which is to make sure you have the permission of that  Now, Maryland has been a very friendly State to the District of But the District is not asking Maryland to become a part of its We want to become the 51st State of the United States of America, and it would probably be easier to do that than to become a part of  Now, we also are not insisting that there is nothing else that will do. We have asked for legislative autonomy.  Why should our legislation have to lay over here for 30 days, or 60 days? They must be legislative days, so that often means 6 months, 9 months, to give the Congress time to see whether the Congress wants to overturn legislation it had nothing to do with and knows nothing about.  The fact is that the legislative autonomy provision is virtually never used. Instead, the Congress tries to add amendments to the District's budget, a sneaky, easy way, they think, to overturn a law. So they keep legislative autonomy on the books inconveniencing the District and never use it.  They fear budget autonomy because they wouldn't have anything to attach matters to like overturning our gun laws. They regularly try to do that on appropriations.  So what you have is a kind of invitation for Members to interfere with somebody else's district, my district, instead of attending to your own business. People did not send my colleagues here to attend to the business of the District of Columbia, and we intend to call them out every time they interfere.  So, yes, we are struggling for the components of statehood, even before we achieve statehood, knowing how difficult and what a high climb that is.

Our economy is one of the strongest in the United It is a $12.5 billion budget total. That is a budget larger than 12 States represented in this House by my colleagues.  How many of my colleagues can boast a $2 billion surplus the way the District of Columbia can?

The residents of this city have fought and died in every war, including the war that created our country itself.  I remember coming to the floor on those occasions where we have voted whether or not to go to war, and on each of those occasions, residents of the District of Columbia have gone. I remember the purple fingers in Iraq and Afghanistan that signified that our country had given them the vote, while the very members of the armed services from the District of Columbia who had served came back to the District of Columbia without a vote themselves.  Is that an irony that this body can even stand any longer? Fought and died in all the great wars of the 20th century, and we remember especially Vietnam, when there were more District of Columbia casualties than from 10 States of the  I don't want to go into the technicalities of congressional power, but Congress has the authority to make our city a State because of its Article IV, section 3 power to admit new States to the When you combine that with Congress' Article I, section 8, clause 17 power over the seat of the Federal Government, which is what the District is, it is an accident, an accident of history that the District does not have the same votes as other                              {time}  1245  It is a slander to think that those who went to war on the slogan of ``no taxation without representation'' would leave any residents of our city without representation.  There was a march by Revolutionary War veterans when the Capitol was in Philadelphia that frightened, frankly, the So they thought: Well, you can't have a separate State, and it can't be part of a State, and we don't know what to do, so let's just make it a district. But they never believed that it would be a district without any rights, and that is exactly what it became.[[Page H1526]]  Indeed, the District was carved out of Maryland and Virginia, but for the 10-year period of transition the citizens of the new district did not lose the votes in the Senate and the Only in 1801, when the District became the Nation's Capital under the Congress of the United States did we lose Senate representation and representation in the  Enormous change has occurred in our city in the 216 years since we became the I am a third-generation My great-grandfather was a runaway slave from Virginia, so my own family has seen 150 years of those changes. This is no longer a sleepy Southern city where I went to segregated schools--segregated by the Congress of the United States, indeed, because it had the sole authority to do it. In fact, today, it is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the United States, a city that people are flocking to for residence.  Everything about the District of Columbia has changed except its status and the status of its residents as second class citizens in their own country. We are sick and tired of being voyeurs of democracy. That is why the District of Columbia gave itself budget autonomy, although the Congress did appropriate a budget. Thank you for nothing. That is why the city voted 85 percent for statehood for itself. The citizens of the District are simply not going to sit still with the status quo. They are not going to sit on their second class citizenship.  So I come to the floor after we have brought our petition to the Congress to become the 51st I come to the floor the day after I have introduced the bill to put the Congress on notice: Be ready. Be ready for a campaign by the residents of the District of Columbia and our allies throughout the United States to be treated fairly, or as Frederick Douglass said, ``not as aliens.''  We can decide to get rid of this anomaly as we have so many others that deprived citizens of the right to vote, whether they were slaves or women. We have gotten rid of those.

9678,topic-id,750,"Mr.President, today I rise to express my strong opposition to partisan attempts to engage in a fast-track process to take health insurance away from hundreds of thousands of individuals in my State and millions across our country. In Michigan alone, 887,000 people are in jeopardy of losing their health coverage if Republicans have their way and repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. Important protections for people with preexisting conditions will disappear. Not only will they lose them but so will their spouses and children.  We will be repealing reforms that have benefitted seniors and saved more than 5 million beneficiaries an average of over $1,000 in drug costs in 2015. Repealing the Affordable Care Act will significantly increase drug costs for those seniors and threaten long-term solvency for Republicans are rushing a process that increases Medicare costs for seniors and weakens the program for future generations. Our Nation's seniors have worked hard their entire lives, and they deserve our best efforts to ensure they can depend on Medicare to help them enjoy a dignified and secure retirement.  Over 1 million seniors are enrolled in Medicare in Michigan, and they deserve a health care program that will cover the costs of prescription drugs and other health care services they need. Since 1965, Medicare has done a tremendous job of giving seniors the care they need, and we should be working to strengthen this successful program, not putting it at risk.  Let's be clear. Reforms in the ACA extend the solvency of Medicare by over a decade. Let me say that again. It extends the solvency of Medicare for over a decade.  Given these challenges, we have to ask: Why are we rushing to dismantle these reforms?  We are rushing a process that will ultimately hurt the Medicare Program, our Nation's seniors, and so many others.  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that we can simply keep or quickly reinstate the popular parts of this law, such as preventing discrimination based on preexisting conditions, allowing children to stay on their parents' coverage until they are 26, and helping seniors afford their prescriptions. I would pose this simple question to any of my colleagues advocating for repeal: What comes next? Show us your plan. Just show us your plan.  Former Governor Cuomo of New York famously said: ``You can campaign in poetry, but govern in prose.'' We are now facing a majority that campaigned on a bumper sticker and is trying to govern with an Enacting a repeal of the ACA that takes effect at some undetermined point in the future will create chaos in our insurance markets. Health care reform is not a stand-alone program that can be removed overnight without creating widespread ramifications for our economy.  Yesterday, I attended the North American International Auto Show in As a Michigander, I am always thinking about cars. Let me suggest an analogy. Many Republicans in Congress talk about the ACA like it is some sort of after-market addition on a car--a flashy rear spoiler, perhaps, or new rims that can just be unbolted and removed. Well, the ACA is actually like the antilock brakes that keep a driver from getting into an accident in the first place and the airbags that deploy to protect everyone inside when the worst happens.  I agree that our health care system needs a tuneup, but we cannot start ripping out safety features without a plan to help keep us safe on the road. We need to fix the Affordable Care We need to do more for small business owners who want to do right by their employees and provide them with quality, affordable health care coverage.  I have offered and supported several proposals to fix the Affordable Care Act, including measures to help our Nation's small businesses. I am ready to work with my colleagues across the aisle to improve this law. However, repealing the ACA without showing the American people their plan for replacement is quite simply irresponsible.  I understand Americans want to see positive changes to the Affordable Care Act, and I agree with them. We should be working together to enact bipartisan improvements through regular order, not fast-tracking repeal. The fact is that most Americans do not want to have this law repealed entirely.

These men and women are coaches, volunteers, and mentors, helping people find jobs, feeding the homeless, helping them find homes, and sometimes even taking them into their own homes. These are real people. They are your neighbors, they are your friends, and they are us. This is not a job for them. It is a calling. They serve because they want to help. They want to make a difference. They serve with the heart of a servant.

The Hyde amendment has saved over 2 million unborn children since 1976, including 100,000 lives in  For decades, this annual restriction on taxpayer funding of abortion has been referred to as the Hyde amendment because it was the late Congressman Henry Hyde from Illinois who sought to protect as many unborn children as he could during his service in Recollecting his own work, Congressman Hyde offered this poignant reflection:  ``When the time comes as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates, you are there alone standing before God--and a terror will rip through your soul like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there will be a chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world--and they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, `Spare him because he loved us'. . . . ''  Henry Hyde is not forgotten, and this work goes on.  Despite former-President Obama's promise that no abortion would be covered by his healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act authorized and appropriated funds for healthcare plans with abortion coverage. This must stop.  We must remember, abortion is not health care, and in no way should the government fund or subsidize the violent destruction of unborn children.  It is the overwhelming opinion of Americans, including those who identify as pro-choice, that taxpayer dollars should not be used for abortion.

9491,topic-id,604,"Mr.President, I strongly opposed the Republicans' efforts to gut the SEC rule regarding transparency for oil and mining industry payments to foreign governments.  I hope the American people are paying attention. One of the first substantive legislative matters that Republicans are trying to send to the President is a measure that makes it easier for oil companies to corrupt foreign governments and undermine U.foreign policy goals.  This bill seeks to unravel human rights and transparency protections implemented by the Obama administration. The rule requires oil and mining companies to tell the SEC how much money they pay to foreign governments to extract natural resources. It is a simple, common-sense requirement to improve transparency and combat corruption in some of the most corrupt and dysfunctional countries in the world. In fact, dozens of other countries require that their companies report payments to foreign governments.  Time and again, we have seen oil and mining companies go into other nations that are poor and lack basic democratic institutions and pay huge sums of money to autocratic corrupt regimes. According to a recent article in Foreign Affairs, when Rex Tillerson led Exxon as its chairman and CEO, Exxon ``cut lucrative deals with dictators in oil-rich pockets of Africa, extending the lifespans of autocratic regimes in places such as Angola, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Equatorial Guinea.'' Thanks to their countries' oil reserves, the leaders of these poor countries have been able to remain in power for decades.  Yet the rule is dogged by many myths and falsehoods spurred by the fossil fuels lobby. More than $200 million was spent by opponents of the rule--the oil and gas industry and the U.Chamber of Commerce--on political lobbying and campaign contributions. According to a report in POLITICO, when our newly confirmed Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, was the CEO of Exxon Mobil, he personally lobbied vigorously against transparency and disclosure, saying that if other people knew how much his company paid foreign governments, it would be bad for his business. In fact, Rex Tillerson said that there was one country in particular where this rule would be hard for Exxon-- Another Republican myth is that U.companies are at a competitive[[Page S744]]disadvantage because non-U.companies do not have to make the same disclosures and the rule applies only to public companies--not true. The U.law covers all oil, gas, and mining companies listed on U.stock exchanges--not simply companies based in the United This includes BP, Shell, and Total, as well as leading state-owned oil companies from China and Brazil, such as PetroChina and  Republicans also claim that this rule increases prices at the pump--again, not true. Corruption costs oil and mining companies millions of dollars every year from instability and fragility in resource-rich countries, which contributes to increased operating risks, waste, inefficiency, and delays.  When leaders tap a country's oil revenues to keep themselves in power, it is called petro-authoritarianism. When the United States allows companies to secretly pay authoritarian governments for rights to their petroleum and mineral resources, we become implicit in the resulting human poverty and rights abuses. We cannot let that stand, which is why we have this SEC reporting requirement.  I urged my colleagues to vote no on this effort to kill the important protections provided by the SEC rule regarding transparency for extractive industry payments to foreign governments. We should be putting human rights interests ahead of the financial interests of a few powerful oil companies. That is why I urged my colleagues to vote against putting the profits of industry above the interests of our Nation and lesser developed nations all over the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS743.txt,1010,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7, NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION",2017.0,6.0,January
9659,topic-id,3544,"Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I want to take this opportunity to make several points in opposition to the Republican side-by-side amendment and in support of the amendment that I have offered.  Like many Republican proposals, if you read the Republican amendment, it sounds good on the surface, but if you probe half an inch into it, you recognize what an incredible disaster it will be for working families of this country--nice words, but devastating impacts. So I want to talk about that.  2, I want to talk about what it will mean if, in fact, the Republicans[[Page S188]]are successful in doing what they want to do, which is repealing the Affordable Care Act--something which I, and I think virtually every Democrat, will do our best to oppose--and what it will mean to the American people if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without any alternative to replace it.  What that, in fact, will mean is throwing 30 million people off of their health insurance. Thirty million people will lose their health insurance. I have not seen any Republican studies as to how many of those people will die, but certainly many thousands of them will die because if you are sick and you don't have any money and you don't have any health insurance, you cannot get to a doctor or you cannot get to a hospital. In fact, there have been some studies suggesting that thousands of people will die, and certainly many others will become much sicker than they should be. That is what happens when you simply throw 30 million people off of health insurance and you have no alternative plan.  Nobody in the Senate thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect, least of all me. I think it needs significant changes. Let's work together to change it. But you cannot just repeal it without any alternative.  Not only will a repeal throw 30 million people off of health insurance, it will devastate millions and millions of low- and moderate-income families by making major cuts to Medicaid, and that includes many middle-class families who use Medicaid to support payments for their parents who are in nursing homes.  If you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, you are going to significantly increase the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens, many of whom have a hard time right now paying for their medicine. And while you have thrown millions off of health insurance, while you make devastating cuts to Medicaid, while the repeal of the Affordable Care Act will raise the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, a repeal would do something else, which is not terribly surprising coming from It would provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. Millions lose their health care, the costs of prescription drugs go up, middle-class families will not be able to afford nursing home care for their parents, but, importantly, from the Republican perspective, $346 billion in tax breaks will go to the top 2 percent.  Now, this is a set of priorities which I, frankly, believe the American people do not support.  Also this afternoon I want to touch on another issue that is actually even more important than the previous two, and that is, to my mind, in a Democratic society, a candidate for President--in this case Mr.Trump--cannot simply say one thing over and over again, cannot go out to the American people and make campaign promises, but the day after the election, forget about what those promises were about.  Now, here is the purpose of the Republican amendment. This is what is in front of all of us right now.       Purpose: To strengthen Social Security and Medicare without      raiding it to pay for new Government programs, like      ObamaCare, that have failed Americans by increasing premiums      and reducing affordable health care options, to reform      Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the      disabled, and to return regulation of insurance to State      governments.  That is the exact quote of the purpose of the Republican amendment that we will be voting on in a few moments. It sounds pretty good. But let us translate it into English, and let us be very clear about what these words actually mean and why this amendment should be opposed by every Member of the U. The Republicans say in their purpose that they want to ``strengthen Social Security and Medicare.'' Well, count me in. That is exactly what I want to do. But how do they propose to go about doing that? They are going to strengthen Social Security and Medicare by making devastating cuts to Social Security and That is a strange way to strengthen a program.  As we speak right now, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security--the committee that has jurisdiction over Social Security--has introduced legislation which will make devastating cuts to Social That is a very unusual way to strengthen that program.  My Republican friends will tell us that the only way we can ``strengthen Social Security'' is, in fact, to cut Social Now, talk about fake news; talk about Orwellian language. We are strengthening Social Security by cutting Social To all those seniors and disabled veterans who are out there and who are trying to get by on $13,000, $14,000, $15,000 a year in Social Security benefits, my Republican colleagues are going to ``strengthen'' Social Security and they are going to do it by cutting your benefits. That is a very strange way to strengthen Social  It seems to me that if we are serious about really strengthening Social Security, what that means in plain English--not Orwellian language--is, 1, if you want to strengthen it, we have to extend the life of Social Social Security now can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American for 17 years. That is It means we are not in a crisis, but it is not good enough. I want to see Social Security be solvent for another 50 or 60 years. That is strengthening Social  When we talk about strengthening Social Security, that means increasing benefits, not cutting benefits. The truth is that seniors in this country cannot make it on $13,000 or $14,000 a year in Social Security benefits; we need to increase and expand their benefits.  Thirdly, if we are serious about strengthening Social Security, we need to end the absurdity of seniors who this year got a COLA of three-tenths of 1 percent, and in recent years have gotten COLAs of zero percent because the formula that determines COLAs for people on Social Security is totally inadequate and an incorrect formula, not really measuring the cost-of-living expenditures of senior citizens.  That is what we have to do to strengthen Social  How do we do that? I have legislation that will do just that. But do my colleagues know what? Despite all of the talk of my Republican colleagues wanting to strengthen Social Security, we have zero Republican cosponsors on that idea.  The way we do it--a concept supported by many of the major senior organizations in this country--would eliminate the earnings cap on all taxable income above $250,000. Right now, if you make $1 million a year, $10 million a year, you contribute the same amount into the Social Security trust fund as somebody who makes about $118,000. That is wrong. That is unfair. Lifting that cap, starting at $250,000 and above, would impact only the top 1.5 percent. If we do that, we can extend the life of Social Security for well over 50 years and we could expand benefits for people living on less than $16,000 a year by more than $1,300 a year. That is how we strengthen Social But I have not heard one Republican in this body speak in support of that proposal.  Now, Republicans say they want to strengthen Medicare without raiding it to pay for new government programs like That is what they state in their purpose. So let me be absolutely clear. That is a totally false statement. It is not true. The so-called raid was an effort to save some $700 billion over a 10-year period by making Medicare more efficient and more cost effective.  My Republican friends talk every day about the need to bring increased efficiencies into government programs. They are right. We need to do that. And that is precisely what the Obama administration did. My Republican friends will not get up here and tell us that there was one nickel of Medicare benefits cut as a result of the creation of the Affordable Care There was not one nickel of benefits cut. They know it. I know it. They will not say otherwise.  So the $700 billion was in savings, doing the right thing--not cutting a nickel of benefits from I hope my Republican colleagues will not continue to try to spread this mistruth.  The Republican amendment that we are going to be voting on talks about reforming Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled. It sounds good. What are they talking about in real English? What they want to do is ``reform'' Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled. What does that[[Page S189]]mean? It means not only do they not want to see Medicaid expanded, as over 30 States have done, what they want to do, and what this language is really about, is to throw millions of people off of We are the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. Some 28 million Americans today have no health insurance. They want to throw millions more off health insurance.  So if you are an ``able-bodied'' adult making the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour--which, by the way, they don't want to raise. Vermont has raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour. I don't know what it is in Wyoming--$7.25. But if you are in a State where minimum wage is still $7.25 and you are able-bodied, do the arithmetic. If you have a couple of kids, health insurance will cost you $10,000, $15,000 a year. How do you afford that when you are making $8, $9, $10 an hour? You don't afford it. That is able-bodied.  The last I heard, it is not criminal activity to be working and making $8, $9, $10 an hour. Unfortunately, that is what millions of people do. They cannot afford health insurance. What many of us have tried to do is expand Medicaid so that they will get health insurance, but what the Republican proposal and their language is about is the denying health insurance for the so-called able-bodied. Let's get rid of the word ``able-bodied.'' Let's talk about working people at starvation wages who cannot afford health insurance. That is what that language means in  The Republican's proposal we will be voting on also talks about ``returning regulation of insurance to State governments.'' It sounds good. What does that mean in the real world? That means you could be denied coverage for a preexisting condition.  I just met a woman last night dying of breast cancer. That is her reality, but she was able to get health insurance, despite having a very severe situation, because we abolished the insurance companies' ability to say no to her and to millions of other people who have preexisting conditions.  When you want to return regulation of insurance to State governments, that is precisely what they can do--the law is gone. The insurance companies can say: You have cancer; we are not going to cover you because you are going to cost us too much money, and we can't make any money from you. Insurance companies could refuse to cover needed things like maternity care, prescription drugs, or high-cost diseases like HIV and many others. That is what they mean when they talk about returning regulation of insurance to State governments, doing away with all of the patient protection we have passed here in Washington that is widely supported by the American people. Go out to Wyoming, go to Vermont, go to Oregon, go to any State and ask the people if we should repeal preexisting conditions so insurance companies can discriminate against people with illness, and they will tell you overwhelmingly no.  So the Republican proposal, which sounds nice, is in fact a devastating amendment that would very negatively impact many millions of people. I hope every Member of the Senate will reject that Republican amendment and in fact vote for an amendment I will be offering which addresses two very important issues:  1, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time when a tiny sliver of our population--the people on top--are getting phenomenally wealthy, phenomenally richer, we have an explosion of billionaires in recent years while the middle class continues to shrink. At a time when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care as a right to all of our people, it would be absolutely unacceptable to take away health insurance from 30 million Americans, unacceptable to privatize Medicare, unacceptable to slash Medicaid, unacceptable to increase the costs of prescription drugs for seniors, unacceptable to defund Planned Parenthood--a high-quality health care organization providing health care to over 2 million Americans, many of whom are low income women. So a vote for the Sanders amendment rejects all of those very bad ideas.  If we throw 30 million people off health insurance and if we do not have a plan to replace it, I would hope my Republican colleagues would have the decency to tell us how many of those 30 million people will die. If we are going to be considering this legislation and throwing 30 million people off who can no longer get to a doctor, can no longer get to the hospital because they don't have the money, how many of them will die? Tell us. Tell us so we can hold that in consideration as we look at this proposal.  For years, it is no secret Republican leaders like Paul Ryan and Congressman Tom Price have wanted to end Medicare as we know it. That is what they have told us. It is not what I am saying. It is not a great secret.  What does that mean? What does it mean if we end Medicare as we know it and if we turn it into a voucher program, handing a 65-year-old senior who has been diagnosed with cancer an $8,000 check and telling them to go out to a private insurance company and buy insurance on their own. That is what privatizing Medicare is about. It is a voucher program. Here is a check. You go out to the private insurance companies. You do your best.  If you are an 80-year-old suffering with cancer and you have a check for whatever it may be--$8,000, $9,000 a year--and you go to an insurance company and you say: What do I get for my $8,000 check, they will laugh at you. They will laugh at you because they understand the cost of your care--your hospital care, your prescription drugs--will go well beyond 8,000 in the first week, let alone year. You will get nothing. That is what the Republican idea is in terms of privatizing  Let me get to the last point I want to make, and that gets well beyond the Affordable Care Act and well beyond Medicaid, Medicare, and Social It gets to the essence of what our political system is supposed to be about, and that is, if we run for office--and every person in the Senate has run for office. If you run for President, you cannot say over and over again that you are going to do this, and the day after the election decide you are not going to do it. That is why so many people in this country are disgusted with the political process. They see people saying: Hey, vote for me. I am going to do A, B, and C, and the day after the election you do the very opposite, D, E, and  When he ran for President, Donald Trump ran a very unconventional campaign. That is for sure. He said: I am not a typical That is what he said. He said: If I am elected President, I, Donald Trump, am not going to cut Social Security, I am not going to cut Medicare, and I am not going to cut He didn't say that once. He wasn't caught in an ambush interview. That was the heart and soul of his campaign. That is what he said to the elderly and to working-class Americans, and many voted for him precisely because he said he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and  On May 7, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted: ``I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''  April 18, 2015, Trump said:       Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social      They want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it      on Medicaid, and we can't do it. And it's not fair to the      people that have been paying in for years. Now, all of a      sudden they want to cut it.  August 10, 2015, Trump said:       I will save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without      cuts.  Without cuts.       We have to do it. People have been paying in for years and      now many of these candidates want to cut it.  March 29, 2016, Trump said:       You know, Paul [Ryan]--  Paul Ryan is, as we all know, the Speaker of the House--     wants to knock out Social Security, knock it way down. . . .      . He wants to knock Medicare way down.  Two things. You will lose the election if you are going to do that. I am not going to cut it, and I am not going to raise ages, and I am not going to do all the things that they want to do. Welcome to ``they.'' That is what the Republicans are trying to do.  Back to the quote:       But they want to really cut it, and they want to cut it      very substantially--the Republicans--and I am not going to do      that.  That is where we are today. Republicans have a proposal which will make[[Page S190]]devastating cuts to Social Security over in the House, and here by repealing the Affordable Care Act, they are going to cut Medicare and  In December of 2011, Trump wrote:       Now, I know there are some Republicans who would be just      fine with allowing Social Security and Medicare to wither and      die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and      Medicaid are wasteful entitlement programs. But people who      think this way need to rethink their position. It's not      unreasonable for people who paid in to a system for decades      to expect to get their money's worth. That's not an      entitlement. That's honoring a deal. We as a society must      also make an ironclad commitment to providing a safety net      for those who can't make one for themselves.  On May 21, 2015, Trump tweeted:       I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know      where to get the money from. Nobody else does.  On and on and on. These are just some of the quotes. This is not like a statement in the middle of the night. This is what he campaigned on.  What this amendment is about and says to my Democratic colleagues and says to my Republican colleagues is, do we hold and support the process in which a candidate runs for office and over and over and over again tells working families and the elderly he will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid--do we hold him to his word or do we just say: Hey, that is just campaign rhetoric. He lied. That is That is politics in It doesn't matter what he said. This is the reality. We are going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and  So this amendment tells us that if we go forward with what the Republicans want to do, it will be devastating to the American people, but perhaps, more importantly, what this amendment says is that in a democratic society, we must have faith with the American people. You cannot run a campaign, make promises, and the day after forget about everything you said.  I would hope very much that my Republican colleagues will join all of us on this side in supporting what democracy is supposed to be about. We have differences of opinions. Mr.Enzi and I disagree on a lot of things, but I have never suggested that Mr.Enzi--when he campaigns, I believe he says what he believes. People vote for him or they vote against him. It is called democracy. Now you have a situation where a candidate for President goes to the working class and says: I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Let us tell Mr.Trump: Let us keep faith with the American people. We heard what you said, and we are going to hold you to your word. Let us support the Sanders amendment.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

9518,topic-id,1195,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about a bill that Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and I have that we will be offering tomorrow. I think it is an important bill from the standpoint of advancing and perpetuating this American notion called freedom. It is a bill that had 130 sponsors in the last I am joined on the bill by Tom Emmer and Mr.Poe and Mr.Amash as original cosponsors as we drop the bill tomorrow. It is quite simply entitled the Freedom to Travel to Cuba bill. It does what the name suggests, to lift the current restrictions in encumbering Americans' ability to travel to  Why is that important?  I think it is important for a number of different reasons, first of which is tied to the basic, fundamental notion of American liberty. American liberty is built of many different things. The Supreme Court has actually determined that as real as what you choose to wear, what you choose to eat, or what you choose to read is this basic, fundamental right to travel.  In the American system, we can travel as we see fit. I can go here, I can go there. I am going to visit my grandmother in Des Moines, my cousin in We choose without government control and without government edict where we come and where we go. It is a far cry from what we saw in the former Soviet Union where you had to have your papers to determine where you could travel.  I have a map of the globe here. Did you know that you or I could travel to any country on this globe except one? You or I could travel to North You or I could travel to You or I could travel to You or I could travel to It may not work out well for you, it may not be the best of trips, but you or I could travel without government prohibition to any spot on this globe except one, and that one is  That may have made sense in 1960. For security reasons in the time of the cold war, it may have made sense to have that prohibition in place. But the question is: Does it make sense today? I don't think it does for a whole variety of reasons.  One, this is about the basic, fundamental American right of travel as we see fit, not as government sees fit.  Two, this is about the American liberty and this fragile notion of, if we don't protect it, government tends to grow. Jefferson talked about this theme a long time ago. He talked about the normal course of things for government to gain ground and for government to yield. So if we don't push back--and this is what the REINS Act was all about--if we don't push back about the government edict or laws that have outgrown their usefulness, what we are doing is we are allowing government to encroach on this fragile notion of liberty.  Fundamental to the notion of common sense is, if you tried something for 50 years and it has not worked, may we not try something different? I was here in the 1990s. I signed onto Helms-But it didn't work, and so we asked: Why not try something different?  What Ronald Reagan proposed at the time of the Iron Curtain was for Americans, kids with backpacks, to travel on the other side of that curtain. That personal diplomacy, that one-on-one diplomacy, would be key in bringing down that wall. That was the notion of engagement.  So I think this is about saying American policy has been the excuse that the Castros have used for 50 years. We have almost the longest-serving dictatorship in the history of globe there with the Castro brothers. What was oftentimes the case is they would blame the blockade, the embargo, Americans' inability to travel, whatever was going wrong with the country rather than simply addressing the real issue. The problem was communism and the way that it encumbers people and their hopes and their dreams. We gave them an excuse. So this is about pulling back the excuse and trying something different. It is about pushing back on a regulation that has not served its purpose.  Three, this is about engaging because that is part and parcel to American liberty. You know, I don't like some of the things that are going on in I don't like some of the things that are going on in I don't like some of the things that are going on in You can pick your country. But what we have chosen, as an American policy, is this notion of engagement, that we ultimately are going to be able to solve more by engaging with other countries. Again, that is why Ronald Reagan embraced it with countries of the former Soviet Union in helping to bring down that wall. So this is about[[Page H176]]perpetuating the notion of engagement and government regulation.  We have just passed the REINS Act, which is all about saying if something isn't making sense, let's peel it back. Let's not have the fourth branch of government going out and perpetuating all kinds of regulations without them going through Yet, with regard to travel to Cuba, you have to sign an affidavit as to why you are going there. You have to keep receipts for up to 5 years proving where you did or didn't spend money. If you fill out a form wrong, you can be subject to a $250,000 fine. Is that kind of regulation consistent with free travel that we all should enjoy as Americans?  Finally, I think that this bill is about bringing about change to My interest is not primarily about My interest is about American liberty and the need to perpetuate American liberty.  But one of the offshoots, one of the benefits is about bringing change to Even the worst detractor of the bill, we are all about the same thing, which is bringing more freedom to that country and the 11 million people that make up that country.  I think that allowing Americans to go there and to tell folks about what you are hearing from your state-run radio station or television station is not the truth, here is what is really going on. It is part and parcel to bringing about a change in It is part and parcel to eliminating the excuses that have been used by the communist regime there. It is continuing the theme of engagement that we have employed for more than 100 years. And most all, it is part and parcel to maintain this fragile notion of American liberty which always needs to be protected.                              {time}  2030  If something has encroached upon American liberty, it is not about a tangible result in the here and the now. It needs to be pushed back. So, fundamentally, this bill is about those five different things. It is for that reason I would ask that viewers talk to their House or Senate Member and ask them to sign on to this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH175-3.txt,91,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7, NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION",2017.0,5.0,January

9615,topic-id,1095,"Mr.President, as we prepare to consider the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, I would like to take a moment this morning to discuss the false choice Republicans are presenting about his confirmation.  The Republican majority wants everyone to believe that by the end of next week one of two things must happen: Either Judge Gorsuch will pass with 60 votes or they must exercise the nuclear option and change the rules of the Senate so that he can pass on a simple majority vote. As Republicans tell it, one inexorably follows from the other. They are talking about next week as if they have no choice but to go nuclear if Judge Gorsuch doesn't earn 60 votes.  It is absolutely false. It is complete hokum. This is not some inevitable showdown. The Republicans control this body. They can choose to go nuclear or not. The ball is entirely in[[Page S2121]]their court. In the past, when a President's nominee didn't get enough support for confirmation for whatever reason, the President just picked another nominee. If it comes to that, that is what this President should do. If Judge Gorsuch fails to garner 60 votes, the answer isn't to irrevocably change the rules of the Senate, the answer is to change the nominee. It is not Gorsuch or bust.  The Republicans are playing a game of unnecessary and dangerous brinksmanship. If it comes to a rules change--and I sincerely hope that it does not for the sake of the grand traditions of this body, for the sake of the advice and consent clause of the Constitution, but if it does--it will be squarely on the shoulders of the Republican Party and the Republican leader--a Republican Party that broke 230 years of precedent when it refused to even consider President Obama's nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland, with almost a year left in Obama's There was no vote--not even a hearing--and Republicans accuse Democrats of the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee? What Republicans did to Merrick Garland was worse than a filibuster. They didn't even grant him the basic courtesy of a filibuster. Merrick Garland actually was a consensus nominee with Republican buy-in for the Supreme  Second, President Trump totally dispatched with the notion of ``advice and consent'' by pledging, before he was even elected, to nominate a Supreme Court Justice off of a preapproved list of hard-right, conservative judges put together by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Contrast that with Bill Clinton, who sought and took the advice of the Republican Judiciary Chairman, Orrin Hatch, in nominating Justices Ginsburg and He did not pick his first choice, Bruce Babbitt, because Orrin Hatch said that would be a bad idea and could not bring the kind of unity we needed. How about Democratic President Obama, who took, again, the advice of Orrin Hatch when he picked Merrick There was bipartisan consultation. That is why the process worked. There is none now. The Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society are not simply mainstream organizations, as every Republican knows, but they are organizations on the hard-right of the Republican side who often threaten Republicans if they don't vote the right way--the far-right way. So we are not talking about ``advise and consent.'' We are talking about something that was done without any consultation and a political move by a President to shore up his base with the hard rightwing.  What President Trump did was worse than simply ignoring article II of the President Trump actively sought the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups instead of the That is another Supreme Court-related precedent that the Republicans discard. Because President Trump made that choice, now Republicans are saying they have no choice but to change the rules? It is illogical and self-serving. For all the handwringing of my friends on the other side of the aisle that they cannot imagine Democrats voting against Judge Gorsuch, I would like to remind them that only three of the current Senators on the Republican side voted for either of President Obama's confirmed nominees. Let me repeat that. Only three of the current Senators on the Republican side voted for either one of President Obama's confirmed nominees. Most voted for neither, and every single one of them lined up to conduct an ``audacious'' partisan blockade of Merrick  It is true the norms and precedents and traditions have been eroded by both sides. We changed the rules for lower court nominees in 2013 after years of unprecedented obstruction by Republicans on routine circuit and district court judges. Still, I am on the record as regretting that decision. But this is in an order of magnitude much greater than that. This is the Supreme This is the Court that is the final arbiter of U.law and the We Democrats have serious principled concerns about Judge Gorsuch, his record, his long history of ties to ultraconservative interests, and his almost instinctive tendency to side with special power interests over average citizens. We have principled concerns about how Judge Gorsuch was groomed by hard-right conservative billionaires, like Mr.Phillip We have principled concerns about how Judge Gorsuch was selected off a preapproved list of conservative judges made by organizations who spent three decades campaigning to move our judiciary far to the right.  Judge Gorsuch had a chance to answer these concerns in his hearings. We were all waiting and hoping, but our questions were met with practiced evasions. He couldn't even answer whether Brown v. Board was decided correctly.  Instead of considering the possibility of another nominee should Judge Gorsuch fail to reach 60 votes, our Republican friends are threatening to press the big red button for him.  Again, the Republicans are creating a false choice--Judge Gorsuch or the nuclear option--in an attempt to avoid the blame if they change the rules, and it just doesn't wash. The Republicans control this body. They are in the driver's seat, and they are the only reason that we are here today. They held this seat open for over 1 year so that this President could install someone handpicked by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society--a lifetime appointment for this President, whose campaign is under investigation by the FBI for potential ties to  I just repeat to my Republican colleagues: You don't need to change the rules if Judge Gorsuch doesn't get 60 votes. You are not required to do so. You just need to change the nominee and do some bipartisan consultation as Presidents of both parties have done in the past.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2120-2.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,30.0,January

Welcome to Congress and welcome to the Committee on  Madam Speaker, the bill that we have before us today is an extension of, really, a bipartisan agreement that we have had for 30-plus years: that we should not have abortions that are paid for by the taxpayer. The bottom line is[[Page H627]]that this is a very difficult issue, no matter which side you might be on; but I believe that the right thing to do is to say that, based upon the morality and, really, the right thing, that the Federal Government, the taxpayers, should not be engaged in paying for abortions, killing of babies in this country.  We believe it is morally wrong, and all we are simply doing today is standing up and saying we are going to extend the same privileges that we have had on a bipartisan basis for 30-plus years not only with the Hyde amendment, but placing that across all pieces, parts of appropriations and bills and things that we do here in This has absolutely nothing to do with taking away a woman's right to choose.

9578,topic-id,1558,"Madam President, I rise today to address the potential confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of I rise today not just as a Senator from Montana; I am a former public school teacher, a former public school board member. I have a mother who was a teacher and an aunt who was a teacher. I have a daughter who is a teacher. I have a sister-in-law who is a teacher. I have a number of teachers in my family. They all have either taught at or currently teach at public schools. When I was growing up, education was a critical part of what we developed into. Public education was something that my parents thought was very important. That was instilled in them by my grandmother, who over 100 years ago immigrated to this country from Sweden, due in part to the public education system we have in this country today.  When I came home from school every day, my mother would quiz me on what went on in public education. By the way, I went to the same school she did. She would find out what had transpired, both the interactions with the kids and what went on academically in the school, and also offer me a hand if I needed help with the academic portion. We would talk about my experiences in the public school because it was important. She knew it was important.  She was the daughter of a homesteader. When she was a child, homesteading wasn't exactly looked upon kindly by the ranchers of the community. They thought homesteaders were taking away their right to make a living--breaking up that good grass and putting wheat on it, making it so cattle couldn't continue to graze there. There was a lot of friction between ranchers' and farmers' kids. They all went to the same public school. In my particular case, it was Big Sandy Public In the environment of that public school, those kids learned to get along. What resulted from that was the ``greatest generation.'' We live in a world today due in much part to their figuring out a way to get along, figuring out a way to communicate, figuring out a way to make the world a[[Page S673]]better place. That was due I think entirely because of the public education system we have in this country today.  Our public education system is--and this cannot be argued--the foundation of our democracy. When I was growing up and the Vietnam conflict was going on and there were conflicts around the world, everybody said: You know, these countries need to have a democracy. And then there was a realization that without an educated population, democracies really don't work.  We have had a democracy in this country for nearly 250 years because of the success of our public education system. We have had a middle class in this country that has been the envy of the world because of our--listen to me--public education system. It is the foundation of our democracy, it is the foundation of our economy, and it is a place where we learn to live together peacefully.  What is troubling about the nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary is that she wants to privatize this public education system we have. I had her in my office. We talked about vouchers, and we talked about privatizing education. We talked about accountability. Her response to the public education system was that it was failing. Her response to that was, pull a few kids out. Pull the kids out who don't have any disabilities, pull the kids out who are a little smarter, and put them into a classroom, and that will be what makes this country great again. This country is already great, and if we do that, I am here to tell the people of the Senate today that we will destroy the foundation of this country and we will destroy--it may take a few years--we will destroy our democracy.  It would be different if Betsy DeVos had spent 1 hour, 1 minute, 1 second in a public education classroom. She was not educated in public schools. She has not dealt with public schools. I dealt with it as a teacher. I dealt with it as a school board member for 9 years. In fact, my second public service job was on the Big Sandy School It is important because my first one dealt with soil and soil conservation, and my second one dealt with education. She has been in neither of those positions. Quite frankly, it doesn't matter that she wasn't in those--except it does because if you don't touch base with what is going on and see the successes that are happening in public education, you can have a warped view of what is going on in this country right now, and that warped view will cause you to do things like say ``You know what, we are going to put up charter schools, we are going to have vouchers, and ultimately we are going to take away public education as we know it today.'' Instead of saying ``You know what, we are going to invest in accountability, we are going to invest in teachers' salaries, and we are going to invest in a 21st-century education system so our kids can compete,'' the answer is ``No, we are going to pull kids out of the school.''  I am going to tell you a secret. I taught in the late seventies. I am far from a master teacher; I taught for a couple of years. I quit teaching because I could do anything else in society and make more money. I could cut meat for a day and make as much money as I made teaching school for a week.  Wouldn't it be a little bit smarter, instead of privatizing the schools, as Betsy DeVos wants to do, to invest in those schools? Let's give the kids the maximum opportunity we can give them. Let's value public education, and let's value education.  I am going to tell you what happens in a rural State like mine with privatization. My school system in my hometown of Big Sandy has about 175 kids. That is not an exception for Montana; there are a lot of schools that have 175 kids or fewer. By the way, that is not high school; that is K-12. Let's say that for whatever reason, somebody wants to set up a charter school a few miles down the road and suck a few kids out of Big Sandy and maybe suck a few kids out of the Fort Benton school system and a few more out of the Chester system. Pretty soon, they have their little charter school, and there is less money to teach the kids who are left in those public schools. What do you think is going to happen to those kids who are left there? That is going to take away from our public education system. Ultimately, it will cause those schools to close because the money that funds our education is at a bare minimum right now.  The other thing that has happened in our public education system is that Congress--people here--has made the promise to local schools to fund kids with disabilities, the IDEA Program, things we can do to help fix public education. Let's fund what we promised--40 percent. It is funded at 16 percent right now. So if we had a person who was going to go in as Secretary of Education and said: You know what, this is a problem, and we are going to fight to make sure that folks have the money from the Federal level to be able to teach the kids; and we are going to live up to our promise; and, by the way, IDEA is a good program that needs to be fully funded, and the Federal Government needs to do their part at 40 percent, I may have a different opinion. But that is not what she wants to do. She, in fact, wants to do something far worse than that.  She told me she wanted to block grant the money for IDEA, which would further put another nail in the coffin of schools around the country, and then put three or four in the rural schools.  It has been documented here earlier this morning that the phones have been ringing off the hook. They have been ringing off the hook opposed to Betsy There are 1 million people who live in Over 3,000 people have contacted me opposing her. I have had 20 contact me to support her.

9690,topic-id,612,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about one of the consequences of Donald Trump's refugee ban that has so far been ignored.  The day after Donald Trump issued his executive order to ban refugees and all citizens from seven Muslim majority countries, four children from El Salvador landed in Miami International  It is a short flight from El Salvador, but the children had been waiting a long time to come here. In 2015, they applied to come here through the Central American Minors program that was started in 2014 as a safe and legal way for a limited--a very small--number of children from Central  After submitting to DNA tests, screenings, and a long application process, they were finally given visas, and they were on their way here. However, after landing at Miami and passing through the Customs and Border Protection screening, and on their way to their connecting flight, they were stopped and pulled into a secondary inspection. For six long hours, these children were detained in a cold room without food or water.  These children had done everything right, and waited a long time to flee a very traumatic situation. They came here, and their first experience was to be treated like criminals.  This is just one example of how Trump's hasty, harmful executive order is undermining our American values. It is just one more reason why, instead of rewriting it, as he says that he is doing, he should rescind it altogether.  But, of course, these children are the lucky ones, the fortunate few who got a chance to come here legally.  Many of my colleagues will recall that, in the summer of 2014, thousands of children from Central America arrived at our southern border. Those children were fleeing gangs and violence. Many of them turned themselves in to the Border They were not trying to sneak in to our country. They were asking for asylum. They were asking for relief and protection.  We knew that if we were going to stop kids from making that dangerous journey to come here, some of them walking over 1,000 miles to our southern border, that we would have to tackle the root causes that compelled them to leave. So the leaders of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, with some help from General John Kelly, came up with a plan to bring some stability to those three countries. And Congress, working on a bipartisan basis, provided some financial support.  But even as we make long-term investments in the Northern Triangle, we need to deal with the fact that children from these countries still need our protection in the short-term. That is why the Obama administration created a few programs to help a very small number of those children.  Those children did what we asked them. They didn't come across our border. They didn't cross They waited in line as they were told, even if waiting in line meant staying in harm's way. Because of Donald Trump's executive order, those children now face a very uncertain future.  Lost in the media coverage of this order is the suspension of the refugee program, blockage of these vulnerable children as well. I am glad that the judge has stayed the order. I hope that the President will respect the judge's order.  But more than that, I hope that the President will take a real look at all the harm that he has already caused for so many people, including so many innocent children. I hope that he puts an end to his cruel, counterproductive executive order once and for all.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Since then, the ACA has helped millions of Americans gain access to affordable healthcare insurance.  We all know what is at stake in this Republican bill. It is a bill that actually has a big old tax in it called the age tax that makes our seniors pay more.  In addition to that, it prohibits Medicaid reimbursement for Planned Parenthood, and Republicans are actively working hard to make access to reproductive care even tougher for low-income women.  Let me tell you this about Texas: In 2014, Planned Parenthood had 34 centers that served over 120,000 women. Additionally, these centers in my home State of Texas provided birth control to over 93,000 women, conducted over 134,000 STD tests, 16,000 pap smears, and 16,000 mammograms.  These crucial services allow women across Texas to take control of their own health care and help them plan for a family when they are ready.  Republicans claim that their replacement plan puts patients first, but limiting a woman's ability to seek care when she seems fit directly contradicts that goal.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2333.txt,2166,IMPACT OF CABINET NOMINATIONS,2017.0,22.0,January

We also passed H.43, which is another step closer to restoring the rights of States to decide how to distribute title X funding for women's health care. The measures ensure that States are not forced to fund abortion providers like Planned  Based on its own annual report, Planned Parenthood performs the most abortions in the United It commits more than 320,000 abortions every year, 887 each day. Mr.Speaker, that is one abortion every 97 seconds. Three unborn children's lives will be taken by Planned Parenthood as I stand here this morning.  Recently, Planned Parenthood has begun attacking me as a supposed enemy of women's health care. Nothing could be further from the truth. All Missourians deserve quality health care, which is one reason I oppose taxpayer funding of Planned This organization does not provide general women's health or mammogram screenings. That is a fallacy.  In the State of Missouri, there are 12 Planned Parenthood facilities scattered across our 114 counties. However, Mr.Speaker, we are grateful to have 588 healthcare clinics that prioritize women's health and wellness. That is 49 healthcare clinics for every 1 Planned Parenthood health center.

Last week I joined my family in Yoder, Kansas, to celebrate the life and legacy of my grandma, Edna Yoder, who recently passed at the age of 105 years old.  I was very close to my grandma, as many of us are to our grandparents. She was a sweet and kind woman who could tell a good story, never met a stranger, and had an infectious laugh. I spent much of my childhood listening to her hum church hymns while cooking a country meal or quilting another masterpiece.  As one of 14 children, born in 1911, she grew up in another era, attending school in a one-room schoolhouse, a time without cell phones or television or even electricity and the other modern conveniences we take for granted today. Yet somehow she survived and had a remarkable life. She saw hard times from the Dust Bowl to the Great Depression to countless world events over the past century.  When she was born, women didn't have the right to vote in America; but even well past turning 100 years old, she was voting in local elections, even for President of the United She saw a lot of Presidents come and go--19, as a matter of fact.  She saw America progress from a country really still recovering from the deep wounds of our Civil War to the world's most indispensable, vital, and vibrant nation. She saw us defeat Hitler in Nazi She saw us bring freedom and peace around the globe to men, women, and children who had never experienced it before.  She was born less than 10 years after Orville and Wilbur Wright took off on their first flight at Kitty Hawk, and yet she would watch Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon while she was just in her fifties. But as the world changed around her, she quietly lived her entire life near Yoder, Kansas, where she raised her children on the same farm that I grew up on.  She worked tirelessly on that farm, milking cows at dawn and bringing in the Kansas wheat harvest in the hot sun. She didn't ask for much: food on the table, a roof over her head, and a better life for her children and grandchildren.  Mr.Speaker, we like to call them the Greatest She was a living embodiment of the values that help make America the greatest country in the world. She was guided every day by her faith in God, and she was truly blessed with more than a century of good health and good spirits in return. She loved her family and deeply believed in hard work and self-determination.  She and her husband, Orie, were married for 49 years, and together they raised their four children and nine grandchildren, and they even watched one of them make it all the way from that farm in Yoder, Kansas, to the United States House of Representatives here in Washington, D.Family always came first for her.  In her later years, she passed the time reading her Bible, playing in the bell choir, and, of course, quilting and playing lots of games. In fact, the last time I saw her recently, we played bingo together, and we wiped out the competition at her retirement home one last time. She was sharp into her final hours.  She was born into a home that did not have a telephone, but in her final days, we were also able to communicate from Kansas to Washington via FaceTime so I would have a chance to speak with her.  We recently had her services at the Yoder Mennonite Church, built just[[Page H2638]]after she born. This was the church she was raised in, was baptized in, was married in, and the church in which we laid her to eternal rest.  From 1911 to 2017, what a ride, what a remarkable life and unforgettable woman. Through it all, she stayed true to what was important to her and what makes America such a strong nation: her faith, her family, and her Kansas prairie values.  Grandma, we were so blessed to have so many years with you. You lived an amazing 105 years. I think if we look closely and we listen closely, you gave us a roadmap for a long and happy life. As you pass on to eternal life, please know that you are an inspiration to all of us every day.
