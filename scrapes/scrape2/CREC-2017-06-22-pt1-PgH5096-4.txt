         NEW JERSEY MAYORS UNDERSTAND COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I stand here proud to represent the 
New Jersey 12th Congressional District. I stand here proud that Mayor 
Eric Jackson of Trenton, Mayor Liz Lempert of Princeton, Mayor Francis 
Womack of North Brunswick, and Mayor Colleen Mahr of Fanwood led the 
charge in understanding that our global responsibility to combating 
climate change starts at home.
  By passing resolutions that pledge their commitment to the Paris 
climate accord, these cities understand that American exceptionalism 
means we lead from the front, not from the back. I consider myself very 
fortunate to have lived my entire life in a State that has so many 
progressive nonprofit organizations and individuals that are working 
every day to protect public health, our environment, and our quality of 
life.
  I commend these cities in my district and the elected officials, the 
business leaders, and the private citizens nationwide who have chosen 
to ensure the cultivation and preservation of this Earth for 
generations to come.
