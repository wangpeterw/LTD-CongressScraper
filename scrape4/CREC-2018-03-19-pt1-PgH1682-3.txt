       CONGRATULATIONS TO HOUSTON'S SUGAR LAND METHODIST HOSPITAL

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln used the term ``four score 
and 7 years ago'' at Gettysburg. If President Lincoln reappeared today, 
he might say: One score and zero years ago, a new Houston hospital, 
Houston Methodist, was brought forth in Sugar Land, Texas, a new 
hospital, conceived in medicine, and dedicated to the proposition that 
all Texans have the best care.
  Seven thousand patients in 1998 became 225,000 in 2017. Over the 20-
year score, Houston's Methodist Sugar Land Hospital scored numerous 
awards, like the best metro area hospital from Fortune magazine.
  There is a very simple reason for this amazing success, I CARE 
values: I, integrity; C, compassion; A, accountability; R, respect; E, 
excellence.
  As CEO Chris Siebenaler said in a recent interview in the Fort Bend 
Focus: ``Houston Methodist Sugar Land is committed to cultivate a safe, 
spiritual, and healing environment for every single patient.''
  Congratulations on 20 amazing years, 20 more to come
