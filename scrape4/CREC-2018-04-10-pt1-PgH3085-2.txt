          RECOGNIZING MARK JOHNSON ON WORLD DOWN SYNDROME DAY

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mark Johnson, a 
fellow Texan, a former marine, a father and a grandfather.
  On March 17 and 18, Mark completed a double Ironman race across the 
State of Texas.
  A double Ironman is a 53.2-mile run, 4.8-mile swim, and 224-mile bike 
ride. He began in Marble Falls in my district and ended in Lufkin, 
Texas.
  When asked why he chose to attempt the event, he answered swiftly: 
``For Wendy, my amazing sister who has Down syndrome.''
  In addition to honoring his sister and raising awareness, Mark 
Johnson has pledged all monetary donations to the National Down 
Syndrome Society. This is the leading human rights organization for all 
individuals with Down syndrome and where he sits on the board of 
directors.
  Today and every day, let us celebrate advocates like Mark, his 
sister, Wendy, and all individuals with Down syndrome and their 
families.
  In God we trust.
