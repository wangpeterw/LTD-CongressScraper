                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 2018

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., 
Thursday, March 1; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved 
to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later 
in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that 
following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and 
resume consideration of the Quattlebaum nomination under the previous 
order.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.
