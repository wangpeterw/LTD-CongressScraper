                           STOP THIS MADNESS

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, the American people have directly felt the 
cost of our Nation's interventionist wars, a cost borneby our Nation's 
sons and daughters who have served and by communities and people in 
every part of this country.
  We have spent trillions of dollars on regime-change wars in the 
Middle East while communities like mine in Hawaii face asevere lack of 
affordable housing, aging infrastructure, the need to invest in 
education, health care, and so much more.
  Our limited resources should go toward rebuilding our communities 
here at home, not fueling more counterproductive regime-change wars 
abroad. I have introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, legislation 
that would stop our government from usingtaxpayer dollars to directly 
or indirectly support groups who are allied with and supporting 
terrorist groups like ISIS and alQaeda in their war to overthrow the 
Syrian Government.
  The fact that our resources are being used to strengthen the very 
terrorist groups we should be focused on defeating shouldalarm every 
American. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation 
and stop this madness.
