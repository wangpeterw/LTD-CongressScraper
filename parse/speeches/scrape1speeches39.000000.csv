8490,topic-id,5236,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Scott Pruitt is the right person to run the Agency, and we need to confirm him.  Over the past 8 years, the political leaders of the EPA have taken actions that have undermined the American people's faith in the They have pushed broad and sweeping regulations that have hurt our economy and have failed to protect our environment. These regulations include the so-called Clean Power This is a rule that will kill job growth in States like Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, and my home State of These also include regulations defining the term ``waters of the United States.'' This was a classic example of Washington overreach. The Agency brought irrigation ditches, plowed farm fields, and even parking lot puddles under Federal control. With both of these rules, dozens of State governments have had to take Washington to court. Why? Well, to try to stop the crippling effects of these Washington-based regulations.  The Agency's outrageous actions have extended beyond these rules and have had real consequences for many American families. According to the chamber of commerce, since 2008 this regulatory rampage by the EPA has destroyed 19,000 coal-mining jobs nationwide. In Kentucky, nearly 4 out of every 10 coal-mining jobs have disappeared over the past 8 years. Ohio and Pennsylvania have each lost more than 1,000 fossil fuel electric power jobs during the same period. In West Virginia, 5,200 coal-mining jobs have vanished just since 2011.  The total cost of all of this new redtape from the Environmental Protection Agency is more than $300 billion. The leadership at the EPA has failed. It has failed because a lot of their regulations are bad ideas.  That is not the only way the political leaders at the Agency have failed; they have actually hurt people and damaged the environment directly. In 2015, more than 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater spilled into the river at the Gold King Mine in The government Agency charged with protecting our environment actually caused this spill and poisoned a river. This was a direct result of negligence on the part of the Environmental Protection This plume of toxic liquid flowed downstream to New Mexico and polluted the Navajo Nation's main source of drinking water and irrigation water.  In the final days of the Obama administration, the EPA then denied $1.2 billion in damage claims from the farmers, the Native American tribes, and small businesses impacted by the EPA's own negligence.  In Flint, MI, old pipes and improperly treated water caused lead poisoning in children. When the leadership at the EPA learned of the issue, they failed to respond in a timely manner. The regional EPA administrator actually resigned following the incident.  For the last 8 years, the political leaders of this Agency have been reckless, irresponsible, and arrogant. Change is badly needed at the Environmental Protection Agency and Scott Pruitt will be that change. Mr.Pruitt has served as attorney general in the State of Oklahoma since 2011--6 years. He has worked to protect the environment in his State, while also working for the benefit of all the people of  He has taken on polluters. He has worked across party lines to do it. When poultry farmers in Arkansas, a neighboring State to Oklahoma, were increasing phosphorous levels in the Illinois River that runs between the States, he worked with Arkansas' Democratic attorney general on a solution. They found a way to reduce pollution and establish permanent standards.  Former Arkansas Attorney General McDaniel, a Democrat, called Pruitt a ``staunch defender of sound science and good policy as appropriate tools to protect the environment in his State.''  Scott Pruitt also helped negotiate a water rights settlement between tribes in The deal will help preserve scenic rivers and lakes so they can be enjoyed for generations to come.  Scott Pruitt also stood up to industry when they caused pollution. That is why the entire Oklahoma congressional delegation has endorsed his nomination. He has been an advocate for the environment in Oklahoma, and he will be an advocate for the environment in  When the EPA overstepped its mission, Attorney General Pruitt led the charge to rein in Big Government Washington overreach. Time after time, Scott Pruitt worked with other States to challenge the Agency when it exceeded its authority. Under his leadership, this Agency will respect the rule of law.  Attorneys general from 24 States have endorsed Scott Pruitt as someone who can protect the environment while also protecting State decisionmaking. He has also won the support of small businesses and farmers around the country. Groups like the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Home Builders, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and many others have voiced their support for Mr. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I take the nomination process very seriously. Our committee thoroughly vetted Mr.We held a confirmation hearing that lasted more than 6 hours. That is by far the longest confirmation hearing for an EPA Administrator on record.[[Page S1231]]During this hearing, Attorney General Pruitt was asked more than 200 questions by Members of the committee. We had four rounds of questions--an unprecedented number. Our Democratic colleagues on the committee noted during the hearing how fair the process was. They said how much they appreciated the opportunity to ask so many questions. After the hearing, committee members submitted another 1,078 written questions to Mr.Pruitt to answer for the record. Again, this is the most ever for a nominee to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection His answers were thoughtful, and they were thorough. That is why I was very disappointed to see the Democrats on the committee decide to boycott the meeting to vote on the Pruitt nomination.  The minority complained that he didn't answer enough questions. Democrats have even complained that he has not been vetted thoroughly enough. That is ridiculous. Scott Pruitt is the most thoroughly vetted nominee we have ever had to lead this Democrats are using delaying tactics to slow down the confirmation of many of this administration's most important nominees. These boycotts and delay tactics do nothing to protect our environment or the health of Democrats are engaged in nothing more than political theater. They are wasting time while the Environmental Protection Agency needs a new  Attorney General Pruitt has protected the environment in his home He is endorsed by his peers, and he has been thoroughly vetted for the job. He will make an excellent EPA It is time for the Senate to confirm him.  Mr.President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following items in support of Mr.Pruitt's nomination: First are two op-eds I authored, one is from FOX News that is entitled ``For Eight Years, the EPA Has Made Life Hard for Too Many That's About to Change.''  The second is from USA TODAY, entitled: ``The Strong Leader the EPA Needs.''  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some other items: a letter from Dustin McDaniel, Democrat and Arkansas former attorney general. In the letter, he writes that he ``saw firsthand how Attorney General Pruitt was able to bridge political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as positive and historic.''  Another item for the Record is a letter from 24 State attorneys general who wrote in support of Mr.Pruitt's qualifications.  Also for the Record is a letter I received from J.He is the director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife In the letter, Mr.Strong directly refutes a New York Times article titled ``Scott Pruitt, Trump's EPA Pick, Backed Industry Donors over Regulators.''  Mr.Strong writes:       As a fifth generation Oklahoman and someone who has devoted      my career to natural resource protection, I take great pride      in the progress that has been made in improving Oklahoma's      land, air, water, and wildlife resources.  He goes on to say--       For the past six years, General Pruitt has been      instrumental in many of our successes and never asked me to      compromise regulatory efforts to benefit industry.  Also, I would like to include in the Record an op-ed by Ed Fite, the former agency administrator of the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers He writes:       Scott Pruitt is one who is committed to finding a balance      that protects and preserves our environment while at the same      time affords an opportunity for a robust economy to exist.      Achievement of one doesn't have to be exclusive of the other.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [FoxNews.com, 17, 2017]  Barrasso: For 8 Years the EPA Has Made Life Hard for Too Many                    That's About To Change                     (By John Barrasso, M.D.)       Seventy-five thousand dollars per day. That's how much the      Environmental Protection Agency threatened to fine a private      land owner in my home state of The crime: digging a      pond in his back yard.       This was an appalling overreach by the Obama      administration's EPA and its regulation of American's      property.       Sadly, this story is not unique.       For the past eight years, the EPA has abused and attacked      far too many hard-working American families.       A regulatory rampage by EPA has led to the loss of      thousands of coal mining jobs in Wyoming, West Virginia,      Ohio, Pennsylvania, and       Wisconsin is poised to lose more than 20,000 jobs in the      next decade because of the Obama administration's proposed      regulations on carbon emissions.       The misguided obsession of the EPA has created needless      economic burdens for It has, at the same time, put      people's health in danger.       Negligence on the part of the EPA resulted in more than 3      million gallons of toxic wastewater being dumped into a river      at the Gold King Mine in       The plume of toxic liquid flowed downstream to New Mexico      and polluted the Navajo Nation's main source of drinking and      irrigation water.       In Flint, Michigan, aging pipes and improperly treated      water caused lead poisoning in children. When EPA officials      learned of the pending disaster, they failed to respond.       The agency's misplaced priorities are harming state      governments as well.       North Dakota stands to lose more than $100 million in tax      revenue over the next four years because of the Obama      administration's ``clean power plan'' regulations. The state      will have to look to already-strapped families to make up the      difference or else cut back on services.       Disregard for the consequences of its actions has become      the trademark of the EPA for the last eight years. Policy      goals and talking points have consistently taken priority      over American families. This cannot be the case any longer.       As chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and      Public Works, I look forward to ushering in wholesale change      at the I will be doing it alongside a committed and      capable administrator.       President-elect Trump has named Oklahoma Attorney General      Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA and to overhaul the agency.      Attorney General Pruitt has seen the effects of over      regulation in his own state and has worked to stop them.       Pruitt has distinguished himself by challenging the Obama      administration on several of its most burdensome rules. He      stood up for Oklahomans against the EPA's extreme regulations      on greenhouse gasses, methane emissions, and cross state air      pollution. He took action against unworkable water rules and      air standards. He sued the federal government to make sure      that it was interpreting the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts      as Congress actually wrote them, not how it benefited      President Obama's political agenda.       Attorney General Pruitt is respected by his peers for the      work he has done. His work in Oklahoma protected the      environment and strengthened the economy by standing up for      states' rights. Attorneys general from 24 states authored a      letter in support of his nomination. They know he can and      will rein in       President-elect Trump has vowed that his administration      will overturn two federal regulations for every new one it      proposes. The administrator of EPA will play a vital role in      keeping that promise. He must make sure that the agency meets      its mission of protecting our environment--ensuring clean      water, air, and land--while allowing our economy to grow.       Our committee is taking up the nomination of Attorney      General Pruitt this week. I look forward to hearing more      about his vision for the agency and how he will help get      Americans back to work.       The EPA has made the last eight years hard for families in      Wyoming and across rural Today, there is reason to      be hopeful.       The status quo at the EPA is changing.                                  ____                   `The Strong Leader the EPA Needs'                           (By John Barrasso)       The Environmental Protection Agency needs reform.       Anyone who doubts the deterioration at this once-respected      agency should recall the summer of 2015, when the EPA spilled      more than 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater into a      Colorado river.       Last month, the EPA denied $1.2 billion in damage claims      from farmers, Native American tribes and small businesses.      This disaster followed the EPA's mishandling of the water      crisis in Flint,       The government agency responsible for protecting the      environment and the health of Americans has been endangering      the public's health.       The EPA has become a bloated regulatory behemoth that has      lost sight of the needs of the American people and the      environment. The agency's bureaucrats have been more      preoccupied with pushing punishing new regulations.       This red tape killed thousands of jobs in energy-producing      and manufacturing states such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania,      Kentucky, Indiana, North Dakota and my state of       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, President Trump's      nominee to lead the EPA, is committed to protecting the      environment--ensuring clean air, water and land--while      allowing the American economy to grow.[[Page S1232]]       Pruitt will be the strong leader the EPA needs. He has seen      the consequences of the agency's overreach, and he has worked      to restore its original focus. He negotiated a water rights      settlement with tribes to preserve scenic lakes and rivers.       He worked with Dustin McDaniel, a Democrat and former      Arkansas attorney general, to reduce pollution in the      Illinois River, which flows between their two states. He      stood up to oil and gas companies that polluted his state's      air and water. Pruitt has won bipartisan recognition and      support. McDaniel called him a ``staunch defender of sound      science and good policy as appropriate tools to protect the      environment.''       Scott Pruitt will be an excellent EPA administrator,      committed to reform.                                  ____                                                 State of Alabama,                               Office of the Attorney General,                                  Montgomery, AL, January 4, 2017.     John Barrasso,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, District of     Tom Carper,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, District of       Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: As the      attorneys general of our respective states, we write to      express our unqualified support for our colleague and the      Attorney General of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, as      Administrator of the U.Environmental Protection Agency,       As attorneys general, we understand the need to work      collaboratively to address threats to our environment that      cross state lines, as well as the importance of a federal      counterpart in the EPA Administrator who possesses the      knowledge, experience, and principles to work with our states      to address issues affecting our environment. We believe that      no one exemplifies these qualities more than Scott       As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt developed      expertise in environmental law and policy. He negotiated a      historic water rights settlement with Indian tribes that      preserved the ecosystems of scenic lakes and rivers; he      worked with his Democrat counterpart in Arkansas to reduce      pollution in the Illinois River; and he represented the      interests of Oklahomans in rate cases against utility      companies and in numerous actions against those who      contaminated his state's air and water.       Attorney General Pruitt is committed to clean air and clean      water, and to faithfully executing the environmental laws      written by He believes that environmental      regulations should be driven by State and local governments--     a notion endorsed by Congress in the Clean Air Act and Clean      Water When our nation is confronted with issues      affecting the environment that are not covered by a      particular statute, Scott will come to Congress for a      solution, rather than inventing power for his agency. He      wholeheartedly believes in a strong Environmental Protection      Agency that carries out its proper duties, providing a      backstop to state and local regulators as they develop      environmental regulations suited to the needs of their own      communities.       Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney      general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is      committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks      always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership      have been invaluable to us over the years.       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency      plays a critical role in our Nation's government.

Re Attorney General Scott Pruitt's Nomination To Serve as          Director of the Environmental Protection     John Barrasso,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Washington,     Tom Carper,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Dirksen Senate Office       Dear Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and Members      of the U.Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: My      name is Dustin I am an attorney in Little Rock,      I served as the Democratic Attorney General of the      Stale of Arkansas from 2007-2015. During that time, I served      for three years as the Co-Chair of the Democratic Attorneys      General Association, I am a member of the Democratic National      Committee and was a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton's      campaign for I am grateful for your work on this      committee. I believe in the core mission of the Environmental      Protection I believe that climate change is real and      overwhelmingly the result of human activity. I believe that      the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in      shaping climate policy. These challenges in a hostile      political environment will be acutely felt by the next      director of the       As you consider the nomination of my friend Scott Pruitt, I      respectfully ask that you enter this letter into the record      so that I may attempt to clarify what I believe to be unfair      criticisms of the historic agreement negotiated between      myself on behalf of the State of Arkansas and Attorney      General Pruitt on behalf of the State of Oklahoma regarding      water quality in the Illinois River watershed.       Prior to the elections of General Pruitt or myself,      Oklahoma grappled with Arkansas municipal water systems and      Arkansas industry, primarily poultry companies, over      increased phosphorous levels in the Illinois River watershed.      Pollution was substantially impacting the water quality in      one of Oklahoma's most scenic waterways. In 2003, an      agreement was executed that would require that the phosphorus      levels be reduced over the next 10 years to a level .037      parts per million. As a result, all parties on both sides of      the state line worked diligently to substantially improve the      water quality.       At the same time, then-Oklahoma Attorney General Drew      Edmondson filed suit using an out of state plaintiffs' firm      against Arkansas's poultry industry. Many criticized the      litigation as taking the focus away from the environment and      placing it on money damages. The State of Oklahoma's outside      counsel presented their case to U.District Court Judge      Gregory Almost all the claims were dismissed by the      court. The evidence was fully submitted to the judge in March      of 2010 on the remaining question regarding injunctive      relief. To this day, no ruling in that litigation has been      handed down,       As 2013, the ten-year deadline for the reduced phosphorus      levels, was approaching, two things were evident: 1.) despite      huge improvements in water quality, the phosphorus levels in      the river would not be at .037 parts per million before the      deadline, and 2.) research into the standard itself called      into question its origin and basis in hard science.       The States of Arkansas and Oklahoma were facing a point of      litigating against one another (again) over this issue to the      detriment of all concerned, I approached General Pruitt to      ask if we could reach a solution that would protect the      environment and demonstrate to our citizens that we were      committed to working together on their behalf rather than      litigating against one another using taxpayer dollars for      lawyers instead of scientists.       The resulting agreement reflects that Oklahoma enhanced,      not relaxed, its enforcement of environmental protections.      Scientists were appointed to establish the proper water      quality metrics, establish a binding standard, and at no time      were phosphorous abatement measures relaxed. It was an      historic moment that demonstrated that cooperation in pursuit      of environmental protection yielded better results than      litigation. The resulting report was recently released from      the commission and is available for your review, (See,      www.ok.gov/conservation/documents/IR%20      2016.12.19%20Final%20Report.pdf)       Recent press accounts regarding these efforts unfairly      mischaracterize the work that was done by General Pruitt and      his team, He was a staunch defender of sound science and good      policy as appropriate tools to protect the environment of his      state. I saw firsthand how General Pruitt was able to bridge      political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach      an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as      both positive and historic.       As I am sure that this committee will have questions about      this matter, I wanted to take this opportunity to add facts      and context to an accomplishment that should stand as a      credit to General Pruitt's career and qualifications for this      nomination.       I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit this      letter to you and to your committee and to be a part of the      record in these proceedings. I thank you for your service to      our nation,           Respectfully submitted,                                                  Dustin McDaniel.[[Page S1233]]                                       ____                                            Oklahoma Department of                                        Wildlife Conservation,                              Oklahoma City, OK, January 15, 2017.     Re Debunking New York Times article, ``Scott Pruitt, Trump's          E.P.Pick, Backed Industry Donors Over Regulators,''          January 14, 2017.     John Barrasso,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Washington,     Tom Carper,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Washington,       Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: Rarely do      I feel compelled to respond to a newspaper article,      particularly one that runs in a nationally renowned news      outlet like the New York I've learned over 23-years as      a State environmental regulator to value the media's role in      uncovering and exposing the truth, not to mention the wisdom      found in the quote, ``Never pick a fight with anyone who buys      ink by the barrel.'' However, the mistruths propagated by the      above captioned article undoubtedly caught the attention of      you, your fellow committee members, and many of your      respective constituents just days before Attorney General      Scott Pruitt's confirmation hearing for EPA Administrator,      and thus deserve a response from at least one of the      regulators that allegedly lost out to industry donors.       First, it's worth noting that I spoke with the New York      Times for nearly fifteen minutes laying out the facts from my      perspective as Oklahoma's former Secretary of Environment and      a plaintiff in the state's litigation against the poultry      industry, then later as Director of the Oklahoma Water      Resources Board--the agency responsible for establishing the      phosphorus standard referenced in the article. One would      think such experience deserves significant play in an article      of this focus, yet more column space was devoted to a retired      employee of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality      who was incorrectly listed as the leader of the agency's      Water Quality Division and wrongfully given credit for being      responsible for ``overseeing the poultry-related cleanup.''      The poultry industry and its related cleanup are governed by      our Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food &      Rather than insinuating that Mr.Derichsweiler retired out of      frustration with General Pruitt, instead of the fact that he      retired after 40 years of service to the State, the New York      Times should have at least divulged that Derichsweiler      currently serves as Vice Chair of the Oklahoma Chapter of      Sierra Club, an organization that has launched a campaign to      oppose General Pruitt's confirmation.       The facts that I shared in my interview with the New York      Times paint a completely different picture than the article      portrays. If I were writing the headline, it would read,      ``Pruitt Helps Deliver Water Quality Improvement in      Oklahoma's Scenic Rivers.'' At the end of the day, that has      been Oklahoma's goal in the Illinois River watershed for      decades, and that is what is happening during General      Pruitt's term as Attorney As I stated to the New      York Times, no State Attorney General can force a Federal      Judge to rule, or I'm certain former Attorney General Drew      Edmondson would have taken such action during his last two      years in office. Rather than beating his head against that      wall, Pruitt helped Oklahoma negotiate a new agreement with      the State of Arkansas that prompted not just a study of the      appropriate phosphorus level necessary to protect our shared      scenic rivers, which the article dismissed as trivial, but      more importantly provided for continued phosphorus controls      on wastewater and poultry facilities. For the first time in      my career, Oklahoma measured decreasing phosphorus levels and      water quality improvement in the Illinois River watershed      beginning in 2012. While many people on both sides of the      border deserve credit for this result, General Pruitt      definitely was a key player. This mere ``study'' ultimately      led to a recent agreement between the states of Arkansas and      Oklahoma wherein Arkansas committed to meet a more stringent      phosphorus standard--another shocking development for two      states that have quarreled for decades and quite the opposite      result one would expect from an Attorney General that is      being unfairly maligned as a shill for industry.       Rather than spend several more pages contesting the      inaccuracies found in the New York Times article, I will      leave you with this overarching truth. As a fifth generation      Oklahoman and someone that has devoted my career to natural      resource protection, I take great pride in the progress that      has been made in improving Oklahoma's land, air, water and      wildlife resources. For the past six years, General Pruitt      has been instrumental in many of our successes and has never      asked me to compromise regulatory efforts to benefit      industry. On the contrary, all of our projects and cases that      involved his office were given staff support at the highest      level and, more often than not, resulted in more stringent      environmental protections, Please do not confuse Pruitt as      being anti-environment because of his well justified (and      strongly supported by me) efforts to counter the EPA's      various attempts to second-guess or usurp State authority.      Rather, he has been a strong ally in defending our ability to      continue the great progress that we've made in protecting      Oklahoma's environment at the state level--progress that is      too often impeded by Federal overreach and interference.       If I can be of further assistance as you embark on your      important task of reviewing Mr.Pruitt's qualifications and      disposition to serve as EPA Administrator, please do not      hesitate to contact me. I've always found Mr.Pruitt to be a      man of great honesty and integrity, so you should have the      perfect opportunity in your hearing to gather facts before      making your final decision. If truth prevails, you will find      what most of us in Oklahoma know to be true: Scott Pruitt      stands for responsible, common sense, State-led environmental      protection efforts that generate positive results.

Environmental Protection As a conservationist and      riverologist, I have worked firsthand with Scott Pruitt and      know a good deal more about him than those nationally that      are attempting to malign him.       I have made it my life's work and my career to look after      our states designated Scenic As a state employee and      a resource facilitator (I cannot take care of these valued-     treasured water resources by myself), I always find myself      arguing for the middle ground, for the workable solution upon      which both sides of an issue can agree. I have looked and      worked for real solutions, and have implemented them with      help from all sides.       I have found that General Pruitt has always done right by      our Scenic He has done every constructive thing that      he told me he would do. Furthermore, for the first time ever,      he has gotten the State of Arkansas, which happens to have      portions of the streams we've designated as ``scenic rivers''      originating in and flowing through their state, to agree to      Oklahoma's Scenic Rivers Phosphorus Standard--an incredible      environmental accomplishment, the impact of which cannot be      understated. Instead of engaging in years of inter-state      litigation, he did this by negotiating an agreement with      Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, a practical and      economical approach that will yield enormous environmental      benefits.       To understand the magnitude of this agreement, one must      consider that Oklahoma and Arkansas have litigated over      Illinois River water quality for more than three decades. The      latest action brought by Oklahoma, about abating water      quality degradation from the land-application of poultry      waste in the Illinois River watershed, has languished for      more than six years in the federal district court. Many      thought that when General Pruitt took office he would abandon      this suit because he is also known for his staunch support of      farming and ranching communities. However, not only did      General Pruitt allow the case to be fully litigated, he      proactively sought this joint state solution to let science      determine the phosphorus standard for the Illinois In      the end, a study conducted by Baylor University reinforced      that the phosphorus standard Oklahoma sought to protect would      remain.       Last, I have not seen him advocate dismantling the      Rather, he has rightfully supported necessary laws but has      challenged the agency when they have written new rules      without Congress having given them authority to do so. An      administrative agency should not decide what the law is in      the absence of legislation.       And so, my middle-of-the-river view is that Scott Pruitt is      one who is committed to finding a balance that protects and      preserves our environment while at the same time affords an      opportunity for a robust economy to exist. Achievement of one      doesn't have to be exclusive of the other.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1230.txt,1881,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,16.0,February
8491,topic-id,9,I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ,CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1230.txt,1881,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,16.0,February
8542,topic-id,3075,"Mr.President, last year was the hottest year on record, and 16 of the last 17 years have been the warmest years ever recorded. Climate change science is some of the most thoroughly established and well-tested research in history, and 97 percent of the published research says climate change is real and caused by humans.  Climate change is an urgent threat to our health, our national security, and our economy. How we address it is what we need to debate, not whether it is real.  As I have said before, I will work with anyone in this Chamber--Republican or Democrat--to address this issue. That is appropriate because survey after survey of people in Colorado--a State that is a third Democratic, a third Republican, and a third Independent--demonstrates that they believe the science, no matter which party they belong to.  In a very welcome sign, just last week, a group of statesmen, including former Secretary of State James Baker III, former Secretary of State George Shultz, and former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, Jr.,--all Republicans--released what they described as a ``conservative climate solution.''  These distinguished leaders have come together at just the right moment--at the perfect moment--because our new President says that he is ``not a big believer'' in climate change. In fact, he claimed during the campaign that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese to make U.manufacturing noncompetitive.  Consistent with that view, the President's nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, recently said that the debate over climate change is quote ``far from settled.'' He wondered in December whether global warming is ``true or not,'' whether it is caused by humans and whether the Earth is cooling instead of heating. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sought to prevent the very Agency he has been nominated to lead from fighting climate change, suing the EPA 14 times.  It is important, I guess, to note that while it is rare for somebody in America to share these views, Attorney General Pruitt is not alone in his extreme views in the new President's Rick Perry, the nominee to be Secretary of Energy, wrote in his book that climate science is ``all one contrived phony mess'' and that the Earth is actually ``experiencing a cooling trend.'' Ben Carson, the nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said: ``It is not clear if temperatures are going up or going down.'' Rex Tillerson, the new Secretary of State, said: ``None of the models agree on how climate change works.'' Mr.Trump's CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, said: ``There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change.''  When the Pope was talking about the importance of addressing climate change, which he said was a very real threat, there was an American politician who said that the Pope should stick to religion and that he wasn't a scientist. In fact, the Pope studied chemistry. I am glad he is using his voice on this important issue.  To be clear, some nominees seem to have undergone a confirmation process evolution on climate, but this seems more an effort to hide their extreme views in an effort to be confirmed rather than a genuine conversion based on facts or science, and that is a shame because the world cannot wait for this administration to stop ignoring the science.  Over the past 150 years, human activity has driven up greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere higher and faster than at any time over the last 400,000 years. That is not surprising because we have pumped almost 400 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial As a result, carbon dioxide concentrations have risen from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history. That significant change over an insignificant period of time is dramatically changing the These emissions act like closed car windows: They allow light and heat in, but they don't allow most of the heat to ever escape.  Already, record heating has melted ice sheets as large as Texas, Georgia, and New York combined, adding billions of tons of water to our oceans every year. These rising seas have partially submerged cities in Florida and Georgia several times per year. They threaten 31 towns and cities in Alaska with imminent destruction. They are forcing a city in Louisiana to relocate its residents away from what is now an almost permanently flooded coast. By 2030, there won't be any glaciers left in Montana's Glacier National  While extreme events and natural disasters become more frequent, so do the effects climate change has on our daily lives. In my home State, 7 out of 10 Coloradans know that climate change is happening, and nearly half say they have personally experienced its effects. Shorter winters are already a threat to Colorado's $4.8 billion ski and snowboard industry and its 46,000 jobs.  Since the snow is melting sooner, there is not enough water for what are now longer summers. Colorado's farmers are forced to grow food with less water, a changing growing season, and higher temperatures. Our agriculture industry employs over 170,000 Coloradans and contributes more than $40 billion a year to our economy. These changes are not only threatening farmers' livelihoods, they are changing production and food prices at grocery stores.  Our beer industry is even weighing in. This week, I received a letter from 32 brewers from around the country, including three from Colorado, who oppose Scott Pruitt's nomination because they depend on America's clean water resources to brew their beer.  Hotter summers and the droughts they prolong cause wildfires that now burn twice as much land every year than they did 40 years ago. Together, State and Federal agencies are paying nearly $4 billion a year to fight those fires. Warmer waters and drought are hurting animals everywhere, like our cutthroat trout populations in That is not just a problem for the fish; in Colorado, rivers generate more than $9 billion in economic activity every year, including supporting nearly 80,000 jobs.  As warmer temperatures increase and spread across regions, so do incidents of vector-borne diseases like the West Nile virus and the hantavirus. And what do we do when we have longer, hotter summers? We crank up the air-conditioning, burning more fossil fuel and only perpetuating the problem.  I understand that sometimes it is hard to focus on climate change when the effects seem distant, but it should be impossible to ignore the immediate national security threat posed by climate change that is here today. Here in the Senate, in 2015, we passed a budget amendment with bipartisan support to promote ``national security by addressing human-induced climate change.'' That is what the amendment said. It got bipartisan support.  The former Secretary of Defense, the former Director of National Intelligence, and the former admiral in charge of U.Naval forces in the Pacific have all warned us that climate change is a threat to our national security.[[Page S1270]]  Around the world, climate change is increasing natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water, complicating American involvement and security. Climate change is linked to drought and crop loss and failure in southern Africa, leaving more than 6 million children malnourished by famine. It is increasing monsoons and heat waves in Pakistan, driving 11 million people out of their homes. It is even connected to water and food shortages that have intensified civil unrest from Egypt to  At home, climate change already has cost us billions to relocate and buffer military infrastructure from coastal erosion and protect military installations from energy outages. At the U.Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, VA, the largest naval installation in the world, sea levels have risen over 1 foot in the past 100 years. All the systems that support military readiness, from electrical utilities to housing at that base, are vulnerable to extreme flooding.  When the Department of Defense ``recognizes the reality of climate change''--those are their words--``and the significant risk it poses to U.interests globally,'' we should listen. When the Nation's most recent national security strategy says that ``climate change is an urgent and growing threat,'' we should act.  As a Senator from Colorado, I understand very well why people sometimes are frustrated when the EPA, for instance, does take action--or sometimes when it doesn't take action.  There are certainly some regulations that don't make sense, where a well-intentioned idea or an ill-intentioned idea--I think they are usually well-intentioned--from Washington ends up not making sense when it hits the ground. That is why I fought to revise EPA fuel storage tank regulations that hurt Colorado farmers, ranchers, and businesses in my home I supported an amendment making the Agency take a look at a new regulation that burdens families trying to remodel older homes. There are other regulations that I voted to get rid of. I supported, for instance, lifting the export ban on crude oil from the United States of America, a bill that we passed last year in connection with a 5-year extension of the tax credits for wind and solar energy, a great deal for the State of Colorado--both the lifting of the crude oil export ban and the extension of the tax credits for wind and solar.  I have also supported and fought for our coal community. In Colorado, working with my colleague Senator Gardner, I fought to keep a Colorado mine open to protect good-paying jobs in my I am proud to have a hard hat in my office bearing the signatures of the people who work at that mine.  I have to say tonight that the often-asserted claim that efforts to regulate carbon or more generally to protect our water and our air have significantly led to job losses in this country is false. This argument is a fraud perpetrated by politicians making promises that are broken from the start.  The reality--and it is important to understand the reality so we can remedy the situation--the reality is that free market forces and not mostly Federal regulation are transforming American electricity production.  American coal employment peaked in the early 1980s, long before we began seriously expanding natural energy. Natural gas has been gaining market share compared to coal since before 1990. Colorado, for example, has benefitted greatly from the natural gas boom. In almost every part of the United States, natural gas plants are now cheaper to build than coal plants. Facilities that were built when I became a Senator 8 years ago were built to import natural gas and are now being retrofitted to export natural gas to the rest of the world. That is good for our environment, and it is good for the geopolitical position of the United  Innovation is making renewable electricity more affordable for everybody. Between 2008 and 2015, the cost of wind power fell 41 percent. The cost of large-scale solar installations fell 64 percent. This has led to a 95-percent increase in solar deployment in 2016 over the previous year. The annual installation doubled in 1 year.  If we truly want to support our world communities, we should listen to Teddy Roosevelt, who once said that ``conservation and rural-life policies are really two sides of the same policy; and down at the bottom this policy rests upon the fundamental law that neither man nor nation can prosper unless, in dealing with the present, thought is steadily given to the future.''  The truth about the future is that there may be a lot of sound reasons to review, revisit, and even retire any number of Federal regulations, and I will bet there are, but cutting regulation will not reopen shuttered coal mines.  It is not about regulations or the EPA or about a War on Economic factors, market factors are driving the shift from coal to natural gas and renewables, and we need to recognize this shift and help coal communities adapt to a changing energy economy. They have contributed to building the economic vitality of this country. Their work helped us win World War We have to recognize the contribution; we can't just turn our backs. But we also need to acknowledge what is causing the changes that are occurring in our energy production because if we can't acknowledge the causes, we can't fix the problem; we can't make a meaningful difference for people in the communities that are affected by these changes; we can't fulfill what have become empty political promises instead of making real commitments on behalf of the American people.  We also have to take advantage of the changes in energy production to fuel economic growth and create new jobs. Already, renewable energy is creating jobs throughout the country. Energy efficiency employs 2.2 million Solar and wind companies employ more than 360,000 Americans, including more than 13,000 in my home State of Colorado now ranks first in the country in wind energy manufacturing. All together, clean energy employment grew 29 percent between 2009 and 2014 in  This isn't a Bolshevik plot, as I said on the floor before. These are American jobs. These are manufacturing jobs. These are plants where it is not just about the wind turbine but about all of the supply chain that goes along with it that can't be made in China and shipped to the United States and installed here. These jobs in this supply chain are American jobs. They are good jobs that pay a good wage, and they are meaningful to our economy. Last year, solar jobs grew 17 times faster than jobs in the rest of the national economy. They increased by 20 percent in Colorado in 1 year.  The expansion of natural gas, as I mentioned earlier, is also aiding our transition to a cleaner energy economy. Between 2005 and 2012, natural gas production grew by 35 percent in the United In Colorado, it expanded by 139 percent. Colorado now ranks sixth in the country in natural gas production as 10 of the Nation's 100 largest natural gasfields are now located in  These industries together create good-paying jobs that can't be exported overseas; and all of these changes, taken together, are beginning to address climate change. From 2008 to 2015, the American energy sector reduced its carbon emissions by 9.5 percent. We reduced our carbon emissions by almost 10 percent while the country's economy grew by more than 10 percent, and we are starting to see the same trend around the world. Global emissions stayed flat in 2015 while the global economy grew. Turning our backs on reality is not a recipe for job creation in this country, but embracing the reality is.  So I would ask this new President, after the campaign he ran and the promises he made, why he would promote policies that will kill American jobs and industries. Unfortunately--I regret to say this--even though 70 percent of Coloradoans say climate change is real and that humankind is contributing to it, the answer to my question about this administration's policies comes back to what it believes--to what it believes is a debate on climate change.  If we allow science to become debatable, we can contort our thinking to fit any fiction at all to support or undermine any public policy. We risk discarding facts we don't like and ignoring experts with whom we don't agree in favor of special interests, which[[Page S1271]]often dominate our political system. Our country needs more from us than that. Our national defense demands more than that from us.  When State Department analysts concluded with evidence, with science, that the Keystone Pipeline would not materially increase carbon emissions--facts lost in the phony debate here in Washington--I voted for it against intense opposition from my own party and many of my strongest supporters. That was a painful vote, one of the most painful I have ever taken and difficult to explain to many people I admire, but I was guided by the facts, not by politics, guided by the science, not by politics.  We have always drawn strength as a country from our belief in science, our confidence in reason and evidence. It is what Harry Truman called our ``unflinching passion for knowledge and truth.'' In school, we teach children to support theories with facts and look to science to explain the world. When it comes to climate change, we cannot allow the narrow limits of political expediency and special interests to cloud our sound judgment. That is not a lesson we should be teaching our children who need us to act on climate. That would set a horrible example for the people who are coming after us.  Our ultimate success in addressing climate change will rely on the same scientific method that sent us to the Moon and eradicated smallpox. If we surrender evidence to ideology, when it comes to climate change, we abandon the process of scientific inquiry. We leave ourselves completely unequipped to defend what we discover to be true. We loosen our grip on the science that allows us to understand that evolution is real and vaccines are effective; that something is true and something else is false. That, not doubt and denial, is the lesson we should leave our children; that we have the courage to confront this challenge without bias; that we have the wisdom to follow facts wherever they lead. That is what this Senate should do. That is what our country should do.  We have seen the evidence now. It is not theoretical anymore that we can grow our economy, the fact that we will grow our economy, that we can conserve energy while we do it, that we can create entirely new industries and technologies to power the most significant economy that human beings have ever seen in the history of the world, and that we can deal with climate at the same time. The two are linked.  Apparently, that is not what this President believes, and that is not what his nominee to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency believes. Because that is so far out of step with what Colorado believes and for all of the reasons I have talked about today and for the sake of our climate and for good-paying American jobs all over this country--but particularly in Colorado--I am compelled to vote no on the President's nominee to head the Environmental Protection  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

8610,topic-id,571,"Mr.President, as we continue to debate H.44, a resolution of disproval to nullify the BLM planning 2.0 rule, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an editorial published last week in the Grand Junction Daily It outlines many of the reasons we should oppose the repeal of the BLM planning 2.0 rule.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The Daily Sentinel, 1, 2017]                            Aligning Values       Colorado's biggest political guns are marching to the beat      of the same drum, proclaiming the Centennial State is the      perfect new location for the massive Outdoor Retailer Show      which is leaving Salt Lake City over the extreme stance      Utah's political leaders have taken on public lands.       Democratic John Hickenlooper and U.Cory      Gardner, a Republican, and Democrat Michael Bennet sent a      joint letter Monday to the Outdoor Retailer Show hailing      Colorado's bipartisan commitment to maintaining and      protecting public lands.       Considering that Utah is ground-zero for a movement to      transfer management of public lands from the federal      government to the states, it's not hard for Colorado to claim      that its values are more closely aligned with the outdoor      industry, which relies on public lands for its livelihood.       Colorado could enhance that claim if Gardner and Bennet      refuse to overturn the first major revision of the Bureau of      Land Management's land-use planning process in three decades.       Congress is seeking to overturn BLM's Planning 2.0      initiative under the Congressional Review The House has      already voted to eliminate the rule. If the Senate follows      suit, it will undo an effort to increase public involvement,      improve transparency and promote science-based decision-     making in public-lands planning.       Planning 2.0 is not without its critics. The Western      Governors' Association has asked Congress in a 10 letter      to ``direct the BLM to re-examine the final Planning 2.0      rule. Any revisions . . . should be crafted collaboratively      with western states.''       But there can be no revisions if the rule is repealed under      the CRA, which is a ``nuclear bomb'' of a legislative tool.      The CRA would not only overturn the rule, but block future      rulemakings that are ``substantially the same'' without prior      approval from       That means the BLM would be stuck with an antiquated      planning process, hobbling the agency in a way that      reinforces all the negative perceptions that already exist      regarding the way it manages public lands.       Sportsmen's groups, the Pew Charitable Trusts, conservation      groups and the Outdoor Industry Association all support      Planning 2.0. The WGA wants to keep it alive to improve it.       Public lands are the backbone of the outdoor industry,      which contributes $646 billion to the economy annually.       Gardner sponsored the Outdoor Recreation and Jobs Economic      Impact Act, which was signed into law by the president last      year. It requires the Bureau of Economic Analysis to      calculate the economic impact of the outdoor recreation      industry and requires the Commerce Department to provide      Congress with a full evaluation of the outdoor recreation      industry.       He obviously recognizes the importance of the outdoor      recreation industry as a jobs creator and an economic engine.      He should also understand that the industry equates killing      the rule with hampering growth.       The Senate vote may have not any bearing on whether the      Outdoor Retailer Show relocates to But supporting      2.0 is a show of good faith that our senators get what's at      stake.

8556,topic-id,444,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.244, as amended, would require the Department of Labor to establish a HIRE Vets Medallion Program to recognize and award employers with a HIRE Vets Medallion for their efforts to recruit, employ, and retain veterans, as well as their work to provide community and charitable services to veterans and their local communities.  While we still have work to do, it is important to note that the veteran unemployment rate has continued to decrease over recent years and, as of last month, was at the low rate of 4.5 percent. Again, we have more work to do. While many factors have led to the continued reduction of the unemployment rate for the men and women who have served, our Nation's employers in both the public and private sectors deserve a lot of credit, and it is important that we highlight the work that these companies have done and that we publicly recognize their commitment to hiring our veterans--hiring our true American heroes. I commend them so much.  With this idea in mind, H.244, as amended, would authorize the Secretary of Labor to create the HIRE Vets Medallion Program, which would recognize employers who hire and retain veterans as well as companies that provide support services to the veterans and their communities.  Employers would earn either platinum or gold status based on requirements that are related to the number of veterans hired each year, providing pay equity for guardsmen and Reserve employees who were called up to active military service and other requirements. Once these employers have earned HIRE Vets Medallions, they would be able to publicly display their awards to illustrate the work they have done on behalf of our veterans and the priorities they place on hiring veterans within their workforces.  As we work to continue to decrease the national unemployment rate among our men and women who have served, it is vital that we highlight and thank the employers who have stepped up and have recognized the benefits of hiring a veteran, and there are many benefits as their work ethic is outstanding--their dedication, their integrity. They are really outstanding people, and I am glad that our employers have stepped up.  I thank the staff of the Department of Labor and the Trump administration for working with us to make improvements to the legislation from what was passed last year.  I also thank Colonel Paul Cook of California for introducing and advocating for this bill, which, again, has my full support.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.244, as amended.

8538,topic-id,2169,"Mr.President, we are in a day--in fact, yet another day--of fast-developing, dramatic events. The news today that LTG Michael Flynn, who served until recently as National Security Advisor, may be culpable of lying to the FBI and therefore prosecutable for a Federal criminal violation adds urgency to the need for a special independent counsel to investigate all of the events surrounding his conversation with the Russian Ambassador and who knew what about it when and what was done.  The severity of this potential constitutional crisis--and we are careening toward a constitutional crisis--makes it all the more necessary that we have an objective and independent investigation, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions recuse himself, and the White House guarantee that documents are preserved--as we have requested in a letter sent by Members of the Judiciary Committee, including myself--today.  The severity of this potential constitutional crisis cannot be exaggerated. Still we are in the early days of a new administration but already the turmoil and turbulence throw into question almost all of the proceedings here on other issues, urgent and important issues--whether infrastructure, trade policy, job creation, economic growth, all of the pressing issues of our day. They also raise potential conflicts of interest on the part of other officials before us now, including the nomination of Scott News that we have also learned very recently, in this day of fast-developing events, increases the importance of deliberate and thoughtful consideration of this nomination.  Just within the last hour, a judge in Oklahoma has ordered the release of thousands of emails sent by this nominee, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, relevant to his dealings with oil and gas interests in his State and elsewhere on relevant legislative and litigation issues. This development really requires a delay in this vote so we can review those emails and know what those conflicts of interest were, what they may continue to be, and whether his answers to our colleagues in his testimony at his confirmation hearing were completely accurate and truthful. We need to delve into those emails, know their contents, examine the contents, in fairness to him and in fairness to an administration that may be appointing for confirmation yet another official like General Flynn, who was forced to resign just days after his appointment.  The interests of the Trump administration, as well as this body, would be well served by delaying this vote so we can review those emails. I call upon the Republican leadership to delay this vote, give us a chance to review the emails, and give the American public a chance to understand how those emails reflect on the qualifications of Scott Pruitt and the potential conflicts of interest that may disqualify him from serving in this all-important role.  I am here to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt, but whether we oppose or approve of this nomination, we owe it to ourselves--I say to my colleagues--we owe it to the United States Senate to delay this vote so the potentially explosive material and contents of these emails can be fully considered. If we fail to delay, we are, in effect, potentially confirming a nominee who may be compelled to resign after his disqualifying conflicts of interest are exposed to public view. We have an obligation in advising and consenting to be as fully informed as possible. If there were no such emails, if there were no such court order, there might be an excuse for rushing to judgment as we are on track to do now. There is no excuse for a rush to confirmation. Our obligation to advise and consent implies also an obligation to review these emails as comprehensively and fully and fairly as possible before we make this decision.  The President has nominated Scott Pruitt as the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to serve a mission, which is to protect human health and safeguard the environment. Even before disclosure of these emails, which involve his contacts with oil and gas interests, he came before us as perhaps one of the least-qualified people in the United States of America to serve in this position. I don't make this statement lightly. It may sound like hyperbole or exaggeration, but the fact is, anyone who studies Scott Pruitt's record as attorney general of his State--and I served as attorney general of mine so I know his position pretty well--can see that his record is antithetical and hostile to the mission and purpose of this  He is a potential Administrator who will take office at a critical juncture for our planet. Sea levels continue to rise, long-established weather patterns[[Page S1263]]have begun shifting, and the average global temperature is rapidly approaching 2 centigrades Celsius above preindustrial levels. That is an increase which many climate scientists believe may be a point of no return--no return for the planet, no return for us, no return for generations to come. We are at a historic moment.  The question will be whether Scott Pruitt will be dedicated to doing something about climate change, about the pollution of our air, streams, rivers, and oceans, whether he will be committed to enforcing the rules and laws that protect us against those dangers of degradation of our environment--degradation of the air we breathe, the water we drink, the open spaces we enjoy.  That is the same Scott Pruitt who was pressed by our colleagues during his confirmation hearing and could not name a single regulation designed to protect clean air or water that he supports--the very same Scott Pruitt, who was asked by our colleague Jeff Merkley whether he agreed with the statement, ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal,'' and he dodged and equivocated. When he was questioned about hundreds of thousands of dollars he has received in campaign contributions from energy companies, he basically refused to answer. He dodged the question. That is the Scott Pruitt who would become Administrator of the EPA, and it is the same Scott Pruitt who, as attorney general of Oklahoma, fought the tremendous progress made by the Obama administration at every turn, taking legal action against the EPA no fewer than 14 times.  While he was in office, he worked hand in hand with Oklahoma's largest energy companies to roll back regulations that are vital to the health and well-being of the American people, not just the people of Oklahoma, as bad as that would be, but of all Americans, all of our plant.  When he worked hand in hand with the Oklahoma energy industry, those common bonds of purpose and work would be well illuminated by these emails that today will be disclosed. In fact, maybe some of those conflicts of interest will be revealed and dramatized by those emails. That is why we must wait to have this confirmation vote.  He sued to try and block efforts to reduce nationwide emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas roughly 30 times more effective at trapping even carbon dioxide. He block the Clean Power He took three separate actions against the EPA's mercury and air toxic rule, targeting standards that the EPA estimates will save 45,000 lives. Those are three more actions, it should be noted, than he took to proactively promote clean air and clean water on behalf of the people of Oklahoma in his entire time in office. Why did he take those actions? Who helped him do it? How and why? The emails will help tell that story and answer those questions.  Taken alone, even without the emails, these actions hardly show a record of someone dedicated to promoting and protecting the environment. Not once during his confirmation process did Mr.Pruitt demonstrate to me a convincing willingness, let alone eagerness, to uphold the mission of the Agency he now hopes to run, nor has he shown an intent to be open and responsive with Members of this body. Most troubling of all, he has, in no uncertain terms, failed to give any indication that he will be a champion for our environment and that he will advance scientifically sound policies to protect the public's health.  The only thing Attorney General Pruitt has made abundantly clear is that he holds a derisively dismissive attitude toward the Agency he now seeks confirmation to lead. His nomination is an affront to the EPA, but even more, it is a threat to our health, a threat to our environment, a threat to the quality of our air and water, and a risky gamble on the world we will leave to our children and our grandchildren.  There is a very real concern about whose side Scott Pruitt will be on. The question is, Whose side will he be on when and if he is Administrator of the EPA? He has already shown a willingness to use the power of whatever office he holds to advance an extreme agenda and to malign opponents. Polluters do not need another champion in this administration, and our environment does not need another foe. We have enough foxes guarding henhouses as it is in this administration.  Mr.Pruitt's coziness with the firms that he will be required to regulate--again the emails will tell the story about his relationships with special interests. That is critically important, and, in fact, even on the record we have now, it should disqualify him from this position.  He doubts the effects of climate change and the extent to which our rapidly warming climate is as a result of human activity, calling this debate ``far from settled'' and placing himself well outside mainstream opinion. His denials are rooted in the promise of funds from corporations and interest groups that think it is far better for their bottom line to pretend that incontrovertible climate change simply doesn't exist.  He is a beneficiary of the denying corporations and special interests, and those contentions are not only regressive and fallacious but dangerous. If he is a prisoner of those special interests, as these emails may show him to be, my colleagues will regret voting for him--another reason that delaying his confirmation vote is appropriate and necessary now.  The scientific evidence of climate change and human involvement is overwhelming. You don't have to look hard to see it. Most of us in this Chamber would need to speak only with a handful of our constituents--the men and women who sent us here--to see the real impact this crisis is having.  My home State of Connecticut has experienced a major rise in storms that have cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as well as several lives. It seems that as soon as our State begins to rebuild from one storm, another wreaks havoc on many of the same devastated communities. These monster storms have become the new normal.  In Connecticut and around the country, weather disasters are rapidly becoming part of a way of life, tragically, for innocent people caught in their wake. In just 6 years, Connecticut has weathered the damage and destruction of a freak October snowstorm, Superstorm Sandy, and the force of numerous nor'easters. Severe storms like these, as well as other disasters--floods, tornadoes, droughts--are happening at a rate four times greater than just 30 years ago.  I am not here to argue climate change. I am here to argue that Scott Pruitt is unqualified to fight climate change because he denies it is a problem, and he denies the mission and purpose of the EPA as a vital purpose and mission of our Federal  The people of Connecticut understand climate change, and they get it. They understand that it is happening and that it is happening in their everyday lives. They see its effects. They know its causes, and they know the truth. It will get worse. We need to take action.  This body is on the verge of action that should be postponed so that we can consider vitally important information in those emails that reflects on conflicts of interest, ties to special interests, influence on Scott Pruitt, benefits to him in the past, and debts that he may owe, literally and figuratively, to those special interests that may impact his performance as Administrator of the  As attorney general of my State, environmental protection was a priority to me. I will be honest; I sued the Federal Government, just as Scott Pruitt did. I sued the Federal Government so that environmental protection would be made more rigorous and stringent and people would be protected, not to slow down the EPA but to speed it up to provide impetus for its action and, in fact, to compel it to carry out its mission and purpose.  Scott Pruitt has acted in exactly the opposite way, and the reasons for his antipathy and hostility to the EPA may well be illustrated even more dramatically and directly by these emails that we should consider.  I urge the Republican leadership to postpone and delay this vote so that we may, in fact, consider those emails.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

8413,topic-id,685,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Americans have always been a people known for taking ownership. We take ownership of our lives and livelihoods, working hard to provide for our families. We take ownership in our communities, setting standards of conduct. We take ownership in all our political process, voting for the right candidates. We have even taken ownership in our world, fighting evil actors and regimes to maintain peace.                              {time}  1230  H.1343, the bill we are discussing today, allows employees to take ownership in their companies. This is the American way.  Under SEC rule 701, private companies can offer their own securities to employees, enabling those employees to take a stake in the company. This is a great deal for both businessowners and employees. I doubt either side of the aisle would disagree.  Rule 701 allows employers to better recruit talented employees and pay them without having to borrow money or sell securities. For some companies, especially younger ones, compensating employees through equity is vital for survival.  These younger companies need the top talent but often can't pay the top salaries. Rule 701 allows them to offer potential recruits a tradeoff: accept a lower salary now for more equity in the company later.  By giving the employees a stake in the company, businessowners reward the employees for their continued hard[[Page H2642]]work and innovation. Workers have an opportunity to buy into the mission and future of the company. They have the opportunity to reap what they sow, making their work more meaningful and fulfilling.  Mr.Speaker, H.1343 simply raises the reporting threshold for companies who issue securities to their employees as compensatory benefits. Right now, any company that issues more than $5 million of securities in a yearlong period faces significant reporting requirements, including financial statements and disclosure of risk factors. These requirements cost small businesses time and money, making them less likely to issue stock as compensation for their employees. That is why this legislation moves the threshold up to $10 million.  The original $5 million threshold was added to rule 701 in 1999 and hasn't been updated since. By easing the threshold and indexing it to inflation every 5 years, we allow companies to increase the amount of stock they offer to employees. Additionally, raising the threshold will prevent private companies from having to disclose confidential financial information.  America is known for taking ownership, but we are also known for innovation. Our technology industry, especially, has propelled our economy and quality of life forward. But so many great tech companies started as small startups, struggling along from month to month before the financial rewards of their hard work could be achieved.  Thinking about the young companies right now that have grand innovative visions for improving our quality of life, this legislation will help them thrive. The employees already pour so much of their livelihoods into the venture. This bill will reward those workers with equity so that their perseverance and investment will pay off.  Mr.Speaker, before I close, I would like to discuss the broad support for this bill. I indicated earlier that both sides of the aisle can support this legislation, and I want to highlight that bipartisan support for the bill.  H.1343 has equal numbers of Republican and Democratic sponsors. Further, the bill passed out of the Financial Services Committee 48-11. A majority of the Democrats on the committee supported the bill. A similar bill passed with a bipartisan vote last Congress, with more than two dozen Democrats joining Republicans to pass the bill. And in the Senate, this same basic proposal passed the Senate Banking Committee by a voice vote just a few weeks ago.  Mr.Speaker, it is clear to see why this proposal is generating so much bipartisan support. With a higher threshold, companies can focus their time on innovating and creating jobs instead of filling out paperwork. Employees, meanwhile, can take a stake in their company and their own future. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

8427,topic-id,1289,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, we often talk about coming together in support of good policy. We all have friends on both sides of the aisle, and we routinely promise to work together on issues upon which we agree. Most of us speak in front of our constituents about our desire to work with the other party. However, we all know that Americans perceive us to be constantly engaged in partisan conflict.  It is unfortunate that we are not able to work together on good legislation more often. It is understandable that Americans feel disappointed by Washington's partisan sniping. But here before us today is a bill with wide bipartisan support. Not only has it already received numerous bipartisan votes, there were only two amendments offered to the bill. One amendment was withdrawn because it was not germane. The other amendment from my good friend from Colorado and the Rules Committee, Mr.Polis, is simply requiring a report.  Why is this bill so noncontroversial?  I believe it has to do with the process by which we received this legislation. The Committee on Financial Services held hearings as far back as 2015 in which problems with the SEC rule were raised by small-business owners.  The sponsor of this bill, Mr.Hultgren, worked with his Democratic[[Page H2647]]colleagues on the committee and introduced a proposal to reform the SEC rule. Chairman Hensarling held a full committee markup last month which allowed for full debate and amendment, and now we have the bill on the floor this week. Good process produces good policy. But perhaps equally as important, good process helps instill faith in this institution. When Americans see us take up an issue, hear their concerns, and work together to find a commonsense solution, they will trust us to tackle even bigger problems.  This may not be the largest legislative product that Chairman Hensarling and the Financial Services Committee produce in this Congress, but, nevertheless, it is an important work that is helping us solve problems faced by American small businesses. This legislation ensures that the employees of America's small businesses can take ownership in their companies and their jobs. It reduces regulatory encroachment on America's job creators and helps our small businesses expand and grow.  I thank Representative Hultgren for bringing this bill before us. I commend Chairman Hensarling for working with both sides of the aisle and for following a good process on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on the bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 240 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     1869) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to      provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination      in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other      purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed      with. All points of order against consideration of the bill      are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and      shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by      the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on      Education and the After general debate the bill      shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.      All points of order against provisions in the bill are      waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for      amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the      House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The      previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill      and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.1869.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an altemative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . .  [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with altemative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

8366,topic-id,611,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.83, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, America's workers deserve responsible, commonsense, regulatory policies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions. Let me say that again. America's workers deserve responsible, commonsense regulatory policies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions.  They deserve a Federal Government that holds bad actors accountable, and a government that takes proactive steps to help employers improve safety protections and prevent injuries and illnesses before they occur. Just as importantly, they deserve to know that Federal agencies are following the law.  For years, Republicans have called on OSHA to reject a top-down approach to worker protections and, instead, collaborate with employers to identify gaps in safety and address the unique challenges facing workplaces.  Unfortunately, under the Obama administration, our concerns usually fell on deaf ears. In fact, one of the administration's parting gifts to workers and small businesses was a regulatory scheme that reflects not only a backwards, punitive approach to workplace safety, but one that is completely unlawful.  Here's why. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers have long been required to record injuries and illnesses and retain those records for 5 years. The law explicitly provides a 6-month window under which OSHA can issue citations to employers who fail to maintain proper records; 6 months. It is written in the law. This approach helps ensure workplace hazards are addressed in a timely manner.  However, in 2006, OSHA took action against Volks Constructors for recordkeeping errors that occurred well beyond what the law allows, well beyond 6 months. The errors were from nearly 5 years earlier. That is why a Federal appeals court unanimously rejected OSHA's overreach. The opinion for the Court stated: ``We do not believe Congress expressly established a statute of limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to ignore it.'' Even President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Garland, agreed OSHA's action was ``not reasonable.''  What came next was an outright power grab. OSHA decided to take its unlawful action one step further. This time it would not only ignore the law, but rewrite it. The agency finalized the ``Volks'' rule, unilaterally extending the statute of limitations from 6 months to 5 years. OSHA undertook for itself the power that only this Congress has to write laws.  The agency created significant regulatory confusion for small businesses. Many would likely face unwarranted litigation because of unlawful regulatory policies. Of course, further judicial scrutiny also means hardworking taxpayers will foot the bill when OSHA is forced to defend its lawless power grab once again.  Simply put, OSHA had no authority to do this. We have a Constitution that grants Congress, not Federal agencies, the power to write the law. But that is not the only reason we are here today. We are also here because this rule does nothing to improve workplace safety.  Maintaining injury and illness records is vitally important and can help enhance worker protections. But that is not the goal of this rule. This rule only serves to punish employers. As we have said repeatedly, OSHA should, instead, collaborate with employers to help them understand their legal responsibilities and ensure safe measures are in place to prevent workplace hazards in the future.  Fortunately, Congress has the authority to reject this failed approach to workplace safety and block an abuse of executive power that began under the Obama administration.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I hope we can all work together to encourage a more proactive approach that prevents injuries and illnesses from happening in the first place.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1421.txt,2197,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR--,2017.0,1.0,February
8367,topic-id,414,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to read very briefly a quote from the court's decision: ``We find this statute to be clear and the agency's interpretation unreasonable in any event''--in any event.  There is no way to rewrite this regulation to comply with the law that is clear. There is no way for the agency's interpretation to become reasonable. It is unreasonable according to the court in any event.  My friend from Virginia talked about the fact that OSHA just updated the regulation to impose a continuing obligation. OSHA does not have that authority. Only this Congress has that authority. No agency can unilaterally decide to change a statutory provision that the court has said is clear. He said this applies to only a few categories of employers. It applies to nearly every category of employers that has 10 employees or more. So you could have an employer with 50 employees, and they are subject to this regulation. This applies to virtually any employer.  OSHA has 6 months to enforce this law--6 months--from any violation. Now, why 6 months? Because it is important to investigate these things quickly and determine whether there has been a violation because things get lost and people leave their employment. Congress made the decision for 6 months because that was a period of time in which OSHA could perform its duties reasonably, and we could get justice the way it ought to be done.  We can amend OSHA, but we have not chosen to do so. Until this Congress chooses to change OSHA, the agency has to comply with the clear wording of the statute as it has been passed by this The agency does not have the right to do this. It would be a waste of taxpayer money and time to force an employer to go challenge this in court when we already know what the result is going to be. It is not up to the committee or to the Congress to go back and review an agency interpretation we know, as a matter of law, is wrong.  So this is a responsible act to take, and I would suggest to the agency and to my fellow Members of Congress that if we want to reconsider a statute of limitations we do it on this floor and not in that agency.

8369,topic-id,1644,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia referred to continuing violations. There is no provision in this law for continuing violations.  Looking again at the court's decision. They said this: the statute of limitation provides that ``no citation may be issued . . . after the expiration of six months following the occurrence of any violation.''  They go on to say this: ``Like the Supreme Court, we think the word `occurrence' clearly refers to a discrete antecedent event--something that `happened' or `came to pass' `in the past.' ''  By any common definition, there was no occurrence; i.e., no discrete action, event, or incident, no coming about, and no process of happening within the requisite 6 months. You can't take that wording and slip into it a continuing violation requirement unless you change the statute. The agency can't change the statute.  The court, in its decision on the Volks rule, also looked at something very important, and that is: Why do we require this agency to do its work in a good period of time?  It says: ``Nothing in this statute suggests Congress sought to endow this bureaucracy with the power to hold a discrete record-making violation over employers for years, and then cite the employer long after the opportunity to actually improve the workplace has passed.''  In other words, we gave the agency 6 months to do its job, and it should do its job.  Now, other people have looked at this, people who are experts in workplace safety.

Our members      use injury and illness data to help them protect workers.      They expect no less of an effective       That being said, ASSE cannot support the requirement that      employers have a duty to record an injury or illness      continues for the full duration of the rccord-retention-and-     access period--five years after the end of the[[Page H1425]]     calendar year in which the injury or illness became      recordable--that OSHA proposes in its July 29, 2015 Notice of      Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) Clarification of Employer's      Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record      of Each Recordable Injury and Illness [Docket No: OSHA-2015-     0006]. ASSE respectfully opposes the adoption of a Final Rule      as proposed in this rulemaking for the reasons that follow.                          nature of violations       ASSE members do not look at the issues raised in this      rulemaking with the same viewpoint of the occupational safety      and health bar that, no doubt, will provide substantive legal      arguments against the case OSHA makes for addressing the      Volks II decision through this rulemaking. Rather, our      members' view is a practical one that comes from years of      experience on the job as the professionals charged with      meeting OSHA's recordkeeping requirements.       Our members know the inadvertent mistakes they themselves      can make in recordkeeping and reporting. They also know what      they typically find when they are hired by a company to help      improve workplace safety and health. As they assess the      workplace's risks and past safety performance to help them      develop safety and health management plans, the reporting      mistakes our members typically find are not very often the      worst cases that, unfortunately, seem to be creating this      rulemaking. The errors in reporting they see are, by far,      minor, isolated, and, if continuing, it is only in the sense      that a typo can be repeated day after day.       They also see mistakes that come from a widespread lack of      understanding of OSHA's detailed reporting requirements. When      seasoned safety and health professionals consistently use      ASSE's educational conferences, our social media, and      opportunities to meet with OSHA staff through the ASSE-OSHA      Alliance to get the best and latest information about OSHA      recordkeeping requirements, we know that, even for them, the      task of meeting those requirements can be too often      confusing. Given that the vast majority of employers report      to OSHA without the help of a safety and health professional,      it is not difficult to see that the significant increase in      records retention that OSHA is attempting to require of      employers here will not succeed in a significant impact on      safety and health among American workers.                        unintended consequences       No reporting error is excusable. But a company's errors to      which OSHA is determined to have access to for a period that      can be up to six years through this rulemaking will not very      often correlate to the risks facing workers, especially the      risks a safety and health professional is trying to address      for the company in the present. The statements OSHA makes      about the value of data collected through current injury and      illness recordkeeping are merely conclusory and are counter      to our members' experience.       Measured against our members' belief that the additional      data will provide little help to them or OSHA, they are      particularly concerned that this rulemaking can only succeed      in driving more employers towards greater expectations that      safety and health professionals will focus energy and      resources on collecting and reporting the lagging indicators      that OSHA requires, taking them away from risk assessment and      management tasks and their efforts to move their employers      towards performance measurements based on leading indicators      that we know can better measure a company's safety and health      performance.       Many of our members, especially those who work in or for      mid-sized and small companies, face a difficult uphill climb      in selling their employers risk management and moving from      lagging to leading indicates. We know OSHA values these      approaches also. But when OSHA uses its limited resources to      focus on measures that do not reflect cutting-edge safety      principles and push our members' efforts backwards, OSHA is      making their job more difficult. Our members value OSHA but      want an OSHA that works with them to advance the best ideas      for advancing workplace safety and health. Requiring this      data to be available for OSHA's use for nearly six years does      not meet our members' hope for an effective                             direct burden       ASSE is also concerned that the OSHA's estimates of the      direct burden this rulemaking will place on employers are      inadequate. The economic analysis states that there will not      be a new cost burden. This was based on a 2001 analysis that      it takes 0.38 hour to record an injury or illness, with a      total cost per case of $17.75. From an informal survey of      involved ASSE members, a more realistic estimate is that an      hour is needed for each case over the five-year period,      taking into account the variety of tasks involved, including      determining if there was medical treatment beyond first aid,      verifying lost and restricted day counts, and adjusting for      changes in the status of a case. An updated economic analysis      is needed, which we urge OSHA to conduct before a Final Rule      is proposed.                        a measure of the problem       Related to our members' concern over the rulemaking's      direct burdens on employers is OSHA's failure to discuss in      the NPR why OSHA faces such difficulty in obtaining adequate      data from employers. No doubt, employers are responsible for      meeting OSHA's reporting requirements. Our members suspect      that OSHA's reporting rules and. deadlines are not effective      and cost employers unnecessarily.       Before requiring more extensive reporting, it would be      helpful both to OSHA and the safety and health community to      know more about why employers do not report. How many      employers blatantly disregard the requirements and how many      are simply making errors? What do employers and their workers      not understand about the requirements? What training or level      of expertise would help fill the gaps in reporting that OSHA      believes exist? We urge OSHA to examine these issues as an.      extension of its economic analysis. With more knowledge,      there may be better ways to address recordkeeping that can      support better employer reporting.                               conclusion       As we say above, our members want a strong and effective      OSHA, But their view of an effective OSHA is an OSHA that can      embrace the best our members already understand about how to      achieve safe and healthy workplaces. An OSHA injury and      illness prevention plan standard that is truly risk-based      would help make OSHA more effective. Greater reliance on      control banding to achieve better protection limits, as we      have recently suggested to OSHA, would. Establishing      professional competencies to define ``competent person'' in      OSHA standards would. Finding a better way to update      consensus standards in OSHA's standards would. Rethinking      OSHA's reporting requirements to help move employers towards      leading indicators and more advanced ways to measure safety      performance certainly would. The areas where OSHA and our      members agree on making OSHA more effective are many. Adding      lengthier reporting burdens that will do little to help OSHA,      employers or occupational safety and health professionals      better manage workplace safety and hcalth will not.       As always, ASSE is more than willing to discuss these      concerns further. Thank you for listening to our members'      views.           Sincerely,                                             Michael Belcher, CSP,                                                         ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1421.txt,2197,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,1.0,February

At its core, the Volks Rule is an extreme abuse of      authority by a federal agency that will subject millions of      American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,      while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety.      Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend      to five years the explicit six month statute of limitations      on recordkeeping violations in the Occupational Safety and      Health (OSH) Act of 1970. This regulation simultaneously      represents one of the most egregious end runs around      Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to      the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from      exceeding its authority to interpret the law.       In 2012, citing the unambiguous language in the OSH Act,      the U.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held      that OSHA could not sustain citations against an employer for      alleged recordkeeping violations that occurred more than six      months before the issuance of the citation because, as the      employer asserted, they were outside the six month statute of      limitations set forth in the OSH The court was      unequivocal in its rebuke of Judge Janice Rogers Brown      expressed particular concern on the issue of the agency's      overstepping its authority: ``we were rightly troubled by the      notion of being asked by an agency to expand that agency's      enforcement authority when Congress had evidently not seen      fit to do so.'' Judge Merrick Garland, in his concurrence,      plainly rejected OSHA's rationale for issuing the fines,      ``the Secretary's contention--that the regulations that Volks      was cited for violating support a `continuing violation'      theory--is not reasonable.'' The Volks decision has since      been endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision,      issued in December 2016, where the court found ``its      reasoning persuasive.''[[Page H1426]]       In response to the Court of Appeals ruling, OSHA      promulgated this regulation specifically to negate the Volks      case ruling and extend liability for paperwork violations      beyond the six month window permitted under the OSHA      issued the final rule in the waning days of President Obama's      Administration with an effective date of January 19, 2017.      Although the regulation was issued in December, it was not      submitted to Congress until January 4, meaning that the      window for CRA consideration is for a regulation that has      just been issued, and is therefore shorter than if it was      being considered under the ``reset'' provisions of the       We urge you to help put a stop to OSHA's abuse of its      authority and support swift passage of a joint resolution of      disapproval for this burdensome, unlawful rule. Because the      final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language      and two U.Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be      allowed to stand.

Re AGC Key Vote--Support Joint Resolution Disapproving of          ``Volks Rule.''     Paul Ryan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Associated General      Contractors of America (AGC) and its 26,000 commercial      construction company members, I strongly urge you to support      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of      disapproval to stop the Occupational Safety and Health      Administration's (OSHA) expansion of the statute of      limitations for recordkeeping violations in the ``Volks      Rule.'' AGC will score this vote as a key vote for the      education of its members on its congressional candidate      scorecards.       This resolution repeals a rule that was issued by OSHA as a      challenge to the judicial branch and congressional authority.      Section 9 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act      subsection (c) says ``No citation may be issued under this      section after the expiration of six months following the      occurrence of any violation.'' That seems pretty clear and      the courts agreed. In 2012, the U.Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit held in AKM LLC dba Volks      Constructors v. Secretary of Labor that section 8(c) of the      OSH Act (the section that requires accurate recordkeeping)      does not supersede 9(c) and therefore does not permit a      continuing violation for paperwork errors and that the agency      is overstepping its authority. Additionally, in 2016 the      Fifth Circuit endorsed the Volks decision in Delek      v. Occupational Safety & Health Review When OSHA      issued its rule, it deliberately and specifically designed      the rule to counter the ruling in the Volks case. Because the      final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language      and two U.Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be      allowed to stand.       The rule is designed to be punitive. It is a regulatory      attempt to expand opportunities to cite companies for      paperwork violations. It was issued in the waning days of the      Obama Administration as an attempt to get around the existing      statute of limitations for recordkeeping violations and      expand that limitation to sixty-six months. It creates no new      recordkeeping requirements. It does not change the data      required under recordkeeping requirements. It does not exempt      smaller companies from this regulation or these      investigations. It does not create any new, safer work      practices. The rule tells OSHA inspectors and company      employees to fix typos from years ago rather than walking the      jobsite, providing safety training or otherwise preventing      tomorrow's accidents. We take worker safety very seriously      and, unfortunately, OSHA's rule would require a colossal      misallocation of resources. That is why we urge you to      support the Congressional Review Act resolution.       Thank you for your consideration of this request.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and      Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade      association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000      chapter members, I am writing to express our strong support      for H.83, introduced by Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.),      which would block implementation of the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration's (OSHA) ``Volks'' final rule. Also      known as Clarification of an Employer's Continuing Obligation      to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable      Injury and Illness, the final rule extends the time period in      which an employer may be cited by OSHA for recordkeeping      violations from six months to up to five years. ABC urges you      to vote ``yes'' on H.83 and will consider this a KEY      VOTE for our 115th Congressional       Currently, the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act      clearly states the statute of limitations for recordkeeping      violations is six months. The D.Circuit Court of Appeals      also unanimously issued a decision holding OSHA could not      issue a citation for a recordkeeping violation beyond the      six-month statute of limitations, and it was later endorsed      by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Delek case. The      Obama administration's final rule not only contradicts the      clear statutory language of the OSH Act, but also two federal      appeals courts.       Nullifying the ``Volks'' rule does not remove an employer's      obligation to record injuries or illnesses. OSHA still has      the right to cite employers for a recordkeeping violation      under the OSH ABC members understand that safety and      health practices are inherently good for business; however,      this rulemaking does nothing to improve workplace safety and      is simply a paperwork burden. OSHA's promulgation of this      rulemaking is a clear overstepping of its authority and a      contradiction of the OSH Act and U.Court of Appeals      decisions.       We urge you to SUPPORT H.83 and we thank Byrne      for introducing this important resolution and look forward to      working with Congress to restore the rule of law.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan:  On behalf of the more than 140,000      members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),      I write in strong support of H.Res 83. This important      legislation will disapprove OSHA's Volks Rule, which is      nothing more than a regulatory end run around Congress and      the courts. If this rule is not disapproved, small businesses      will be subject to recordkeeping paperwork violations that do      nothing to improve worker safety. NAHB is designating support      for passage of H.Res 83 as a KEY       Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend      to five years the explicit six-month statute of limitations      on recordkeeping paperwork violations in the Occupational      Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970. Subsequent court rulings      have affirmed applicability of the six-month statute of      limitations; nonetheless, the Agency proceeded with its      rulemaking. This regulation is an egregious end run around      Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to      the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from      exceeding its authority to interpret the law.       Given the vast overstep the Volks Rule represents, one      might expect significant gains in worker health and safety as      the result. Unfortunately, that is simply not the[[Page H1430]]     case. The Volks regulation only changes the window during      which OSHA can issue a citation for recordkeeping paperwork      violations. Employers will have the exact same obligation to      record injuries as they always had, and OSHA will have the      exact same opportunity to issue a citation as the statute has      always permitted.

Re Key Vote Alert!       To the Members of the United States Congress: The U.     Chamber of Commerce supports H.83, which would      invalidate the regulation issued by the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration (OSHA) entitled ``Clarification of      an Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an      Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness,'' and      will consider including votes related to it in our 2017 How      They Voted scorecard.       The rule would have the effect of extending to five years      the statute of limitations on recordkeeping violations that      the Occupational Safety and Health Act sets at six months. It      was OSHA's attempt to negate a 2012 decision from the D.     Circuit Court of Appeals involving a construction company      known as Volks The decision blocked OSHA from      sustaining citations for recordkeeping violations that      occurred beyond the six month statute of limitations      specified in the Occupational Safety and Health The      court's unanimous 3-0 ruling included Judge Merrick       The court unequivocally rebuked OSHA, expressing particular      concern on the agency's overstepping its authority: ``We do      not believe Congress expressly established a statute of      limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to      ignore it . . . The Act clearly renders the citations      untimely, and the Secretary's argument to the contrary relies      on an interpretation that is neither natural nor consistent      with our precedents.'' The Volks decision has since been      endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision, issued      in December 2016, where the court found ``its reasoning      persuasive.''       OSHA's Volks Rule will improperly subject millions of      American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,      while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety. It      simultaneously represents a usurpation of Congress' power to      write the laws and a direct rejection of the judicial      branch's authority to rein in an agency when it exceeds its      authority.

Because we have a right to expect in this country that these regulatory agencies that Congress sets up will do their job with the significant sums of taxpayer money that they are provided by this Congress, the money that comes from the people of America to do their job in a timely fashion. And this agency comes forth and tries to act like it doesn't have the money or the authority to investigate violations and enforce the law within 6 months of a violation. That is balderdash. The American people have a right to expect more from these agencies than that.  But more to the point, the reason we are here today is really simple. We are here today to overturn a rule that is blatantly unlawful. We are here to put a stop to a rule that does nothing--I repeat nothing--to improve workplace safety. We are here to put a check on the very top of executive overreach the Congressional Review Act sought to address.  By blocking this punitive and overreaching rule, we will affirm Congress' commitment to proactive health and safety policies that help prevent injuries and illnesses before they occur.

On March 3, Gary Petersen retired from over a half-century career of private and public service supporting scientific achievement and advocacy for the people of my home State of Gary has worked tirelessly to support the Hanford cleanup and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, and has undoubtedly bolstered our Nation's security during the 52 years that he has lived and worked in the Tri- Gary and I have collaborated closely many times over the years on many projects. Most recently, he played a key role in organizing the energy workforce roundtable held at PNNL with Department of Energy Secretary Moniz in August of last year. Gary has been a steadfast advocate for cleaning up the Hanford site, funding for the world-class research and development at PNNL, and for the continued growth of the Volpentest HAMMER Training Center at the Hanford site. I am confident that Washington State, and especially the Tri-Cities, would not be as well positioned to tackle our Nation's future energy challenges if not for over 50 years of Gary Petersen's tireless work.  Originally from Omak, a small city located in Okanogan County, Gary joined the Army and was stationed in the Tri-Cities in January 1960. After a duty station transfer to Korea, Gary returned and graduated with a communications degree from Washington State Shortly after graduation, Gary started with Battelle, a company that had a contract for a research and development lab located at That lab provided crucial services during the Cold War and is now known as Gary went on to work for Westinghouse on the Fast Flux Test Facility, the Washington Public Power Supply System, and spent time with the International Nuclear Safety Program, a cooperative nuclear energy safety effort between the U.and Soviet After retiring from Battelle in 2002, Gary served on the Tri-City Development Council, TRIDEC, an organization dedicated to improving the economic health of the Tri-Cities area.  During his 14 years at TRIDEC, Gary has been a relentless supporter for DOE's missions at Hanford and PNNL and a champion for the larger Tri-City community and our State by ensuring important projects received needed Federal resources. Gary is the type of constituent every member hopes to have in their communities back home--a very involved citizen. He has been a strong advocate for the issues that matter to the people of Washington while also understanding the importance of communicating with his political representatives. My relationship with Gary has been invaluable, and he has been instrumental in many of my proudest career accomplishments.  Gary shares my vision for why establishing the Manhattan Project National Historical Park was so important. We worked together for many years to champion and ultimately see the creation of the Manhattan Project National Historical The legislation I authored preserved the central landmark of the Hanford site and the park, the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production nuclear reactor ever built and a tremendous technological achievement for its time. The park also includes the Bruggemann Agricultural Warehouse, the White Bluffs Bank, the historic Hanford High School, and the Hanford Irrigation District's Allard Pump Visitors from 70 countries have already visited the B Reactor, demonstrating the uniqueness of the park and the curiosity people have about this chapter of American and world history. We all owe Gary a debt of gratitude for the establishment of this park.  Today the Tri-Cities is home to a vibrant agricultural industry, some of the best healthcare available, two colleges that are training workers to meet the varied needs of the region's businesses, increasing wine tourism, and a newly expanded airport. Gary has touched all of these projects and many more.  I am incredibly proud to have worked with Gary and to call him a friend. Gary, thank you for all of your years of advocacy for the Tri-I join Washingtonians in thanking him for his longstanding service and wish him and his wife, Margaret, all the best in the future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2149-2.txt,172,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1343, ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE",2017.0,30.0,April

8503,topic-id,1175,"Mr.President, for the last 47 years, the EPA has enforced science-based environmental policies that have resulted in cleaner air and water, the cleanup of some of our Nation's most contaminated lands and waters, and has improved our understanding of our changing climate. All of this has led to a healthier  Bipartisan Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency--everybody from the great Washingtonian Bill Ruckelshaus to most recently Gina McCarthy--took on the role and responsibility as EPA Administrator, knowing that it was their responsibility to protect existing environmental law and to let science be the guide on research and new policies. They took the EPA mission to heart, and they fought to protect human health and the environment.  I have questions about whether the nominee, Mr.Pruitt, follows those same values, and I come to the floor to oppose his nomination to be the Administrator of the  Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly attacked needed EPA regulations, and he supports polluters at the expense of the environment and health laws. He doesn't believe the scientifically proven causes of climate change are real.[[Page S1241]]  Less than a year ago, then-Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, working in their State, wrote: ``Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.'' That was written in the Tulsa  When questioned by my colleagues during the hearing process, he said: ``The climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner'' but the degree of that contribution is ``subject to more debate.''  The reason I raised these issues is that this issue of climate and climate impact is so real in the State of It is already happening, and it is already affecting our industries.  As EPA Administrator, Mr.Pruitt would have the responsibility for setting the Agency's agenda, including how to respond to climate change, yet the fact that he doesn't support the existing climate change science puts him in a role where I think he would not protect the economic interests of our  We cannot have a lackadaisical attitude about these issues. It is not a hypothesis. It is here. It is happening.  In the Pacific Northwest, it is altering our region's water cycle, putting Washington's farming jobs and our $51 billion agriculture economy at risk. Wildfire seasons are longer and more severe than ever before. It is costing our Nation billions of dollars.  Warmer water temperatures in our streams and rivers have degraded salmon spawning habitat, led to massive die-offs, and certainly our shellfish industry has been very challenged.  With 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions being absorbed by our oceans, it is raising the acidity level, and that is impacting the chemistry of Puget Oceans and their absorption of carbon dioxide emissions and these acidic conditions are making it hard for our shellfish industry to do the type of seeding that needs to take place. It is severely impacting the Pacific Northwest's $278 million shellfish industry. Ocean acidification has been found to dissolve the shells of important prey species, and the ocean acidification effects then carry up the food chain, if they are not addressed.  If we have an EPA Administrator who isn't going to work to cut down on carbon emissions and thinks that it is only part of the impact, aren't there a lot of Northwest jobs at stake? For example, our maritime economy alone is worth $30 billion, so I would say there is a lot at stake.  In looking at the record of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, he fought EPA regulations that protect public health, including the cross-state air pollution rule, the regional haze rule, the clean air standards for oil and gas production sites, and the clean water rule.  Despite this issue of repeatedly suing the EPA, he recently told Congress: ``I do not expect any previous lawsuits to adversely affect my performance as EPA Administrator.''  Well, I have serious concerns about how Mr.Pruitt's past lawsuits will influence his aggressive attitude as EPA Administrator in not fighting for the things that are going to protect the jobs and economy in Washington State that count so much on a pristine environment.  A letter was sent by 773 former EPA employees who served under Democratic and Republican administrations, stating: ``Mr.Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest that he does not share the vision or agree with the underlying principles of our environmental statutes.''  His record does not give me the confidence that he is the right person to lead this Agency at this point in time.  But there are other issues. During his time as Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt planned the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil This summit brought together energy industry executives with attorneys general to strategize against EPA, and they specifically discussed EPA's overreach, as they put it, regarding a very important issue called the Pebble  The Pebble Mine is an attempt by some who want to actually establish a gold mine in the very place of one of the most successful salmon habitats in the entire world: Bristol Bay,  The EPA followed the letter of the law in their multiyear, science-based assessment of Bristol They basically made sure that everybody understood what was at risk: that Pebble Mine would destroy up to 94 miles of salmon spawning streams; it would devastate anywhere from 1,300 to 5,350 acres of wetlands; and it would create 10 billion tons of toxic mine waste, which is nearly enough to bury And all of this would occur in the headwaters of the greatest salmon fishery on Earth, where half of the sockeye salmon on the planet spawn.  So the notion that this is how this nominee would spend his time--as I said, the mine itself is a direct threat to the $1.5 billion salmon industry in Bristol That is 14,000 jobs just in the Pacific The importance of making sure that the mine is not located there is of the utmost importance, I say, to the salmon fisheries of the entire Pacific  I want to make sure we are putting someone in place who is going to fight for the laws that are on the books and to show leadership, not spend time trying to undermine the Agency, the organization, and its existing authority.  If Scott Pruitt allowed Bristol Bay to go forward, it would be devastating to our It would be voting in favor of these polluters instead of making sure that we are protecting science and environmental law.  I have very serious concerns, and that is why I am opposing this nominee. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will realize that these economies--the ones that depend on clean air and clean water, safe salmon spawning grounds--are dependent on our doing the right thing to protect what is really our stewardship of this planet that we are on only for a very short period of time. I hope my colleagues will consider all of this and oppose this nominee.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

8619,topic-id,523,"Mr.President, we had a chance earlier today to talk about this Congressional Review Act resolution before us that I urge my colleagues to turn down. This resolution basically would negate a very important aspect of a rule that was put in place to help the public have more input on public lands.  The rule was pretty straightforward--common sense--to make sure that there was a lot of increased public input to bolster the decisionmaking process and to ensure that there are 21st century management policies in place.  There is nothing in this rule that was implemented in the last administration that erodes or takes away from the States' and local governments' planning processes and the decisionmaking they do.  So it is very important to me that we continue to have the transparency and openness and sunshine in our public planning. I think one editorial from the Post-Register from Idaho said it best. So I will read from it.       Resource management planning. Sound boring? But if      you are a Westerner, it definitely shouldn't be.       Resource management planning (RMP) affects how you can or      can't use the vast swaths of public lands outside your back      door for things like hunting, camping, four-wheeling, hiking,      fishing, and rock climbing--a lot of the things you probably      love about being a       With a new Republican presidential administration in power      and the GOP-controlled Congress rubbing its hands together in      delight, ready to implement part one of its grand scheme for      public lands--cashing in on[[Page S1625]]     those resources--RMPs should get a whole lot more interesting      to       Since 2014, BLM officials have been toiling away,      rebuilding the current rules for land use planning in a      significant way for the first time since 1983. . . .       One important change is that Planning 2.0 would let the BLM      take into account local impacts from the beginning.  Going on to read from the editorial:       The Republican-controlled House has already passed a      resolution to strike Planning 2.0 from the books once and for      all. The Senate will vote within days on whether or not      they'll use the same sledgehammer--the Congressional Review      Act (CRA). It's an especially diabolical weapon.       Once the CRA is used on Planning 2.0, it will be gone      forever. It prevents future BLM rules for planning land use      from being introduced if they are ``substantially the same.''       The utterly confounding part is why this rule is being      picked on in the first place. . . .       Planning 2.0 actually mandates more local control, gives it      more often and is a smarter, more elegant solution to sharing      use of our public lands.  I couldn't say it better than that editorial. Local communities are watching. They want more sunshine. They want more input. They want a smoother process. They don't want lawsuits that take forever. They want us to work in a collaborative fashion, guaranteeing the public input of local governments, States, and our citizens in how we manage our Federal lands.

8493,topic-id,1166,"Mr.President, I am here to address an issue that I think is of great importance to this country and to this administration; that is, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the new EPA  We are nearly 8 years removed now from what we consider--many of us, I think, particularly as we look back--the great recession. However, many American workers, their families, and their communities have yet to feel the benefits of any kind of a recovery. A key component to a slow recovery--the[[Page S1235]]slowest recovery since World War I--is the regulatory overreach coming out of this city--Washington,  Since the end of the recession in June 2009, Federal agencies have burdened a weakened economy with thousands of pages of new rules, costing consumers billions of dollars. Tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. The EPA has perhaps become the poster child for this overreach, from restricting carbon emissions without the direction of Congress--and according to the clean air direction of Congress of what is important--to federalizing every stream, every pond, every wetland under the waters of the United States rule, to unilaterally banning virtually Appalachian coal mining by obstructing the permitting process and pursuing ozone standards that the vast majority of the country cannot meet. The vast majority of the country is still trying to meet the ozone standards that were established under the last regulation.  I support the mission of the EPA in protecting human health, in protecting our air and our water, but there has to be a balance. There has to be a balance between growing the economy and preserving the environment. Over the last several years, we have seen that balance very disrupted. This disruption is at odds with the law and the well-being of many of our working families.  This has been acutely felt in my State of West Virginia where we have lost more than 35 percent of our coal jobs since the year 2011. That is more than 7,000 jobs eliminated in a relatively small State like West Virginia, and many of these jobs are very high-paying jobs.  As a nation, we have lost more than 60,000 coal miners in the same timeframe. This has hurt our workers, our families, our communities, and our  The loss of good-paying jobs means less commercial activity. It means less tax revenue to support our education, our county school systems, our county ambulances, our county sheriff's departments, and our law enforcement. For example, little old Wayne County in West Virginia has lost 88 percent of its coal severance taxes between 2013 and 2016. This year, our Governor and our legislature are struggling right now with a $500 million budget deficit, largely due to the loss of our coal jobs.  Patching that shortfall could mean significant tax increases, painful cuts in public services, or both, which could further hurt and cripple our local economy. It will be a long road undoing the legal and economic damages suffered over the last several years.  Voters in my State and across the country have made it clear that fixing Washington includes meaningful reforms for the way that the EPA operates and has been operating.  So what do we have before us? We have a great nominee for EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is presently the attorney general of another energy-producing State--Scott is committed to returning the Agency to its core mission of protecting our air, our water, and our land without undercutting the economy. At least, we know that he will listen to the other side and try to be reasonable.  He will ensure that the EPA abides by congressional intent, and he will be an active partner with State and local stakeholders in the rulemaking process.  Going back to the stream buffer rule and the reason that fell apart--and I am so pleased that the President is going to be signing the CRA on that today--the EPA invited States to come in and speak about the rulemaking process. Within months, it became very apparent to the States that are charged with protecting the water that this is just window dressing. They realized: They are not listening to us, and they don't really want us to buy in. Eight of those States left.  So as the attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, he has held industry to account as well protected lakes and streams in his I asked him in the committee: If the State or local government doesn't intervene in what looks to be an environmental issue--not just a crisis, but if they are not doing their job in protecting the air and the water--what would you do as the EPA Administrator? He said: That is where we should be stepping in. That is where we should be helping those States meet those standards, helping those States get the right information.  So I think he is going to be unafraid to take on the EPA when it is set to ignore a State's sovereignty.  Mr.Pruitt is the most thoroughly vetted candidate for this position in history. He fielded 6 hours' worth of questioning before the Committee on Environment and Public Works, where I serve. During that hearing, he assured me that he will engage directly with the State of West Virginia and visit our We could never get the EPA Administrator to visit our State and listen to our side. He will visit our State, listen to our side, and reform the rulemaking process to prevent another open assault on our economy by unelected bureaucrats.  He also committed to me that he would pursue full implementation of the bipartisan Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a bill on which we joined together--Republicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle, with President Obama--to modernize our toxic chemical regulations in terms of water.  This is important to me. I was talking to my colleague from Michigan about this issue. We had a water crisis in West Virginia where we had a large chemical spill. This bill, under Scott Pruitt's leadership and my pressing for the implementation, as others will be, will help us in situations like this.  Beyond the over 200 questions he answered in the hearing, he answered more than 1,000 followup questions. He is the most thoroughly vetted nominee for Administrator in the history of the I am confident--very confident--as he assured me in committee and in personal meetings, and I have watched him in action in terms of questioning the overreach in the court systems. He has worked with our attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, to be the leader in this.  I have confidence that he embodies the leadership that we need to restore the balance and accountability to the EPA in a way that will benefit the public health and benefit environmental preservation, as well as restore much-needed economic growth that needs to be a part of the balance that we want to see restored back to the  With that, I yield the floor.

8529,topic-id,2437,"Mr.President, I take this time to explain to my colleagues why I will be opposing the nomination of Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection  I first want to start by saying I had an opportunity to visit with Attorney General He is a person who wants to serve our country, and we very much appreciate that. He has a distinguished career in public service, and we appreciate his willingness to continue to serve at the national level.  My reason for opposing his nomination is that he has opposed most of the missions of the Environmental Protection Agency as the attorney general of He has filed numerous lawsuits that would compromise the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to protect our environment.  I come to this debate acknowledging that there are national responsibilities to protect our environment. The United States must also be engaged in global leadership as it relates to our environment. The people of Maryland want clean air. The people of Maryland want clean water. No State can guarantee to its citizens that its air will be clean or that its water will be safe. These issues go well beyond State boundaries. They go beyond national boundaries. It is for that reason that we need an Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who will lead our Nation both in the appropriate controls and regulations to protect our air and water but also work for our country in regard to the global efforts to protect our environment for future generations.  Let me talk about the issue of climate change. Climate change is one of the greatest threats of our times. We know that this year, according to NASA--they looked at the temperature rise in 2016 and found it to be the hottest year ever recorded. We know something is happening in regard to global climate change. It is affecting so many different areas. We have eroding shorelines that our constituents see. We have major military installations located along our coast that are at risk as a result of rising sea levels from ice melt. We have populations that are at risk in the United  Let me give one example, if I might. Smith Island, MD, is a very proud community. It is a community that historically has been one of the strongest in regard to watermen and dealing with the fruits of the Chesapeake It is a proud community, and it is in danger of disappearing because we have sea level rises resulting from ice melting from climate change. We know there is a problem developing that we need to deal with. It is affecting our economy.  In my State of Maryland, the seafood industry is concerned about the future of the blue crab crop. They know that juvenile crabs need sea grass in order to be able to be protected and mature into full-blown blue crabs. With water becoming warmer, the future of sea grass is challenged, putting the blue crab at risk.  That is just one example. There are many more examples I can give about how it is affecting the economy of my It is affecting our ability to enjoy our environment, the recreation itself, and it is certainly providing a real risk in regard to the real estate. We have some very nice real estate located right on the coast or on barrier islands that is at risk of being lost as a result of climate change. We see more and more major weather events occur on a much more regular basis, causing billions of dollars of damage and putting lives at risk.  We know climate change is here. It is happening. The science is pretty clear. When we asked Attorney General Pruitt his view about the science of climate change, his answer was ``far from settled.''  The science is well understood. What we do here on Earth--the release of carbon emissions--is causing an abnormal warming of our climate. There are activities that we can do to reduce that effect on our climate. We know that. That is what science tells us. We know we can affect the adverse impacts of climate change if we take action. That is what scientists are telling us.  The world came together on this issue in I was proud to head a delegation of 10 Members of the U.Senate as we went to Paris to make it clear to the international community that the United States wanted to be part of a global solution to climate change. Not any one country can reverse the trendline that we are on that is catastrophic; we need all nations to do everything they can to reduce the impact of climate change by reducing their carbon and greenhouse emissions. That is what the global community needs to do, but we have been unable to get the global community for all countries to live up to their responsibilities.  Under President Obama and our leadership, we were able to get the world community--over 190 nations--to come together in Paris, in COP21, for every nation to take responsibility to reduce their carbon emissions so that we all can benefit from that effort.  I am concerned as to whether Mr.Pruitt, if confirmed as the EPA Administrator, will continue that U.leadership. He has not been at all committed to U.programs on dealing with climate change, let alone our international responsibilities to lead other countries to do what they need to do. I will give one example. Part of our way of showing the international community that we are serious about the climate issue was the powerplant rule issued under the Obama administration. Attorney General Pruitt joined a group in opposing that powerplant rule through filing suit against the implementation of that particular law.  We need someone who is going to lead on this effort in America and understand that we have responsibilities to lead the international community. We are at great risk from the impact of climate change, and that needs to be understood and recognized by the leader of the Environmental Protection I am not convinced Attorney General Pruitt would do that.  I want to talk a little bit about clean air. Maryland has taken pretty aggressive steps to improve the air quality from emissions within the geographical boundary of the State of That is what every State should do. But here is the challenge: Maryland is downwind from many other States' emissions, so we are seeing days in which our air quality is below what it should be, not because we haven't taken action but because we don't have a national policy to protect our clean air.  The health of Marylanders depends on the Federal Government being aggressive in guaranteeing that all citizens of this country--that steps are taken to protect the air they breathe. I can tell you the number of children who have asthma who suffer when the air quality is not what it should be. It is not only wrong from the point of[[Page S1257]]view that we have an obligation to our children to make sure we give them the healthiest air to breathe, it is also costing our economy because every day that child stays home, a parent cannot go to work. The child loses their time in school; they are being disadvantaged. If they have to take a day off from summer camp, the parent has to stay home, and it is wasting resources in this country.  For many reasons, we need an Administrator of the EPA who is committed to a national effort to make sure the air we breathe is clean and healthy.  Likewise with clean water. Some of us remember when the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. We know that pollution was so bad, you literally could set our rivers afire. We took steps. And it was not partisan--Democrats and Republicans came together with the Clean Water We recognized that the Federal Government has the responsibility to protect the quality of our water so that we have safe, clean water in  I think we have been working to improve the Clean Water Act consistently on a nonpartisan basis, but now we have Supreme Court decisions that challenge what water the Federal Government can regulate. Congress has not taken steps to clarify that. The administration took efforts to try to clarify that under the waters of the United States, only to see a Court action to put that on hold in which Mr.Pruitt joined as the attorney general of Oklahoma, once again slowing down our effort to protect the clean waters of  I have spoken numerous times on the floor of the Congress about the Chesapeake Bay and how proud I am to be a Senator from Maryland, one of the six States that are in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, along with the District of  We know that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. It has been so designated by many Presidents of the United It is the latest estuary in our hemisphere. The watershed contains 64,000 square miles, has over 11,000 miles of shoreline, and 17 million people live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed--150 major rivers, $1 trillion to our economy. It is part of the heritage of my State and our region. We are proud that it is part of our life. It is part of why people like to live in this region. They know the Chesapeake Bay makes their life so much more enriched and so much more valuable.  The Chesapeake Bay is in trouble. I could talk about it from a technical point of view. It doesn't flush itself as quickly as other water bodies. The historic oyster population is not what it has been. We have to, therefore, make special efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Over 30 years ago, almost 40 years now, while I was in the State legislature, when I was speaker of the house, I worked with Governor Harry Hughes, and we developed a State program to deal with the Chesapeake  We did it the right way. We started at the local levels. We got all the stakeholders together: the farmers, the developers, the local governments, the private sector, our local governments, the State government. We worked with Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is where the Susquehanna River flows, and that produces most of the fresh water that goes into the Chesapeake We worked with Delaware, Virginia, New York, and West Virginia, and we developed the Chesapeake Bay Program that is worked from the local level up. We get together to determine what is reasonable: What does science tell us we can do?  We have all the stakeholders sitting around the table as we develop these plans. They all sign up. Our farmers recognize that clean water will make their agriculture more profitable. They recognize that. Developers understand that we need a clean Chesapeake Bay as part of our ability to develop profitable real estate in our community. These are not inconsistent. A serene environment, clean agriculture, a strong agriculture, a strong economy are all hand in hand together.  It is not a choice between one or the other. We recognize that. That is why the Chesapeake Bay Program has never been partisan in We have had Democratic and Republican Governors who supported the Chesapeake Bay We have had legislators lead this effort from both parties. Senator Mac Mathias, who served as the U.Senator from Maryland, was the champion of bringing the Federal Government into the Chesapeake Bay The program is working. It is making the bay safer today, but we still have a long way to go.  We enforce it through the TMDL, the Total Maximum Daily Loads, so we can monitor that we are making the progress we said we could make, based upon best science. And that is what the local stakeholders have signed up for.  When we did our TMDL's, it was challenged. It was challenged in the courts. Mr.Pruitt was one of those who brought a challenge against the TMDL Program in I am thankful that the Third Circuit upheld the legal right of the TMDL, and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision by the Third So we won the legal case.  But it troubles me that a program that is from the ground up, from the local governments up, in which the Federal government is a partner--why it would be challenged when it was supported by the local communities. To me, that case should never have been challenged.  We need the Federal Government to continue to participate with us. The Chesapeake Bay Program is supported through the farm bill, through the Water Resources Development Act, through the Clean Water Act, and through annual appropriations. So we need continued support at the Federal level for the Chesapeake Bay And we need a champion in the Environmental Protection Agency that will help us in that regard.  I want to talk briefly about the Safe Drinking Water Safe drinking water is critically important. We know that in recent years, we have found too much lead in drinking water. We all know, of course, the story of Flint, I could take you to Baltimore where our schools have to cut off their water fountains because of the unsafe levels of lead in the drinking water, if they were permitted to drink from the water fountains.  We can tell you about so many communities in the Nation that have a desperate need to clean up their safe drinking water so that we can protect our children from lead poisoning. I hope my colleagues understand that there is no safe level of lead in the blood. It robs children of their future. It poisons them. I think most people are familiar with the Freddie Gray tragedy in Freddie Gray was a victim of lead poisoning when he was young.  We owe it to our children to make sure we do everything we can so they are not exposed to lead. I asked questions about that during the confirmation hearing of Mr.The answers were less than acceptable and showed his lack of real information about the dangers of lead.  Every Congress should look at their responsibility to build on the record, to leave a cleaner and safer environment for the next generation. The EPA Administrator should be committed to that goal. I do not believe Mr.Pruitt will be that type of leader. For that reason, I will vote against his confirmation.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

8492,topic-id,1477,"Mr.President, I just want to follow up on the comments of my friend, the chairman from Wyoming, and I note that Scott Pruitt has responded to more questions than anyone in EPA history since Gina McCarthy, the past Administrator who responded to more than 1,400 questions, and she actually responded to them completely, not evasively and not indirectly. She needed more time, given the volume of questions, and more time was granted so she might more fully answer the questions that were raised. I just wanted to add that if I could.  Mr.President, I come to the floor to share with you and with our colleagues the reasons I oppose the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the EPA Over the last month, we have had a number of President Trump's nominees come before the committee and be debated on the Senate floor, as you know.  We have had multiple confirmation hearings in a single day, with Members[[Page S1234]]running to and from hearings trying to learn more about nominees and get important questions answered. So I understand if some of my colleagues who have attended back-to-back hearings have not yet delved into Scott Pruitt's record as deeply as we have on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and that is why we are here today.  As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I, along with my colleagues on the committee, have scoured Mr.Pruitt's record to the best of our ability with the somewhat limited information the nominee has provided.  We sat through his nomination hearing, where we asked him fundamental questions about his views on the role of the EPA and what he would do to protect our environment and public health. We submitted additional questions we had for the record and read through all of Mr.Pruitt's responses. We have done our due diligence with the information we received, and I want to share with my colleagues and all of those watching exactly why, based on this review, I cannot support Mr.Pruitt's nomination.  First, I think it is important to revisit just why the EPA is still so critical. This Agency was created 46 years ago by a Republican President named Richard Nixon with the support of a bipartisan Their task was implementing our Nation's most important clean air, clean water, and safe chemical laws. The EPA is required to use sound science to protect both our environment and our public health, and, by and large, the EPA has done it successfully--not perfectly but successfully for decades while our economy has continued to grow. Many people may not remember a time before the EPA, a time when States had to work individually to protect citizens in the communities in which they lived, a time before the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act were signed into law, a time when businesses operating throughout the United States were faced with a myriad of conflicting State and local laws affecting our health and environment. The choking smog and soot of a half century ago seems unfathomable now. Rivers on fire and deadly toxic plumes sound like something almost for another world, impossible in our United States of  Today we have the luxury of largely forgetting these frightening circumstances, thanks to the efforts of the EPA and its employees, in partnership with State and local governments and with countries and companies and businesses across The EPA and its many partners throughout the country have been so successful that it is easy for some of us to forget why this Agency is so critical. Some may presume there is not much more for this Agency to do. That could not be further from the truth.  The environmental threats we face today are real. They don't respect State boundaries. Over time, my State of Delaware has made great strides in cleaning up our own air pollution, but our work only goes so far.  In Delaware, like many States on the east coast, we sit at the end of what is known as America's tailpipe. Ninety percent of the pollution in Delaware comes from outside the First State, from plants hundreds of miles away in places like Kentucky, Ohio, my native West Virginia, Indiana, and throughout the  As Governor of Delaware, even if I had eliminated every source of air pollution within our State by stopping every combustion source and ordering every motor vehicle off our roads, Delawareans would still face deadly doses of air pollution. Should Delawareans be forced to live with consequences of decisions made by polluters hundreds or even thousands of miles away from us? I don't think so. I don't think so. That is not the Golden Rule I know.  Fortunately, the EPA has recently implemented something called the good neighbor rule to make sure all States do their fair share to clean up our air. Every citizen in this country has a right to breathe clean air, regardless of where they live, whether they live in a downwind or an upwind That is why we have the  We have known for decades that most of the mercury in our fish comes from air pollution that is emitted from the dirtiest coal plants and then settles in our waterways. We know mercury is a powerful neurotoxin that accumulates in our body over time, threatening the health of this generation and generations to come. The EPA recently issued public health protections to clean up the toxic air pollution from our dirtiest coal plants, allowing families in Danville, where I grew up alongside the Dan River, and thousands of other communities that can once again eat fish from our rivers, lakes, and streams without concern of mercury poisoning. That is why we have the  Too often, when States and local communities are pinched for cash, they try to save money by shortchanging clean air and water protections. Improvements to infrastructure are often ignored, corners are cut, and solutions are adopted that may save dollars now but inflict costly unnecessary damage later.  As we have seen most recently in the city of Flint, MI, these cuts can have a terrible and even tragic impact on the health of the most vulnerable in our society, especially on the youngest among us. Today, the citizens of Flint still lack clean drinking water, and a new generation in that city which has been exposed to high levels of lead faces an uncertain future. That is why we have the  Many people don't know it, but Delaware is the lowest lying State in our The highest point in the State of Delaware is a bridge. Back home, the reality that our climate is changing is not up for debate. Families and business owners face the stark realities of climate change almost every single day. Tackling that challenge is not just the right thing to do or what is best for Delaware's economy, it is a matter of survival. Our little State alone cannot stem the flow of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere that is largely causing our climate to change, our seas to rise, and our coastlines to retreat. Every State--every State--must do its fair share to safeguard our climate and their neighbors. That is why we have the  Examples of the air and water pollution produced by one State and fouling the air and water of others can still be found in too many parts of America, like the runoff from Pennsylvania that degrades the waters of the Chesapeake Bay or the haze exported from other States that oftentimes shrouds the Smoky Mountains and degrades visibility at the Grand That is why we have the  Throughout my years in the Senate and as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have had the opportunity to consider the credentials of five different nominees to serve as EPA Administrator--individuals put forth by both Democratic and Republican I have supported candidates in the past because they were able to clearly demonstrate their commitment--candidates like former New Jersey Republican Governor Christine Whitman and former Utah Governor Mike I was proud to support them both, proud of their service, and proud of their role as head of But I have supported candidates like them because they clearly demonstrated their commitment to advancing the mission of the EPA--the mission to protect human health and to protect our environment. Never have I been forced to consider a candidate to lead the EPA who has been so focused throughout his career on crippling the Agency he now seeks to lead or so hostile to the basic protections to keep Americans and our environment safe.  So, with that, I am going to close, and I will come back many times in the hours to come as we continue the consideration of this candidate's nomination.  I yield the floor.

8513,topic-id,859,"Mr.President, I would like to follow up on something our friend from Mississippi was just saying. I want to make it clear that I am not really interested in obstructing. I am not interested at all in obstructing. What I am interested in is getting to the truth about this nominee and others.  Two years ago, an organization called the Center for Media and Democracy petitioned, under the Oklahoma open records law--it is a FOIA-like law at the State level--they asked for access to thousands of emails that were sent from or to the attorney general's office under Scott That was 2 years ago. They have repeatedly renewed that request over time, and it has not been granted.  Why might emails be germane? Well, they are germane because many of the emails were with industries that have differences with the EPA and in some cases are involved in lawsuits, a number of which were sponsored by or joined in by Attorney General  Two years after the request to see those emails was submitted to the attorney general's office, they had not seen one of them. A lawsuit was filed earlier this month asking the court--I think it is called the district court of Oklahoma, a State court--asking to see the emails and asking that the court intervene so that the Center for Media and Democracy would have access to the emails.  The Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee wrote to the judge, and we shared our voice because we have been making the same request of the attorney general's office--of the attorney general--as part of the nominations process. He has declined to provide the emails to the Congress, the Senate, and we have let the judge know that we appreciate her attention to this matter and hope she might even expedite it. Well, an expedited hearing is called for this afternoon on the sharing of these emails that have been blocked, stonewalled, for 2 years.  What we did as Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee is I met with the majority leader, and nine of us wrote to the majority leader, and we said: With all due respect, we suggest to give the judge time to make a decision, and if the judge says the emails should be opened up, allow us to have until a week from this coming Monday to look at the emails to see if there is anything inappropriate or untoward that could be revealed.  That request to the majority leader--he was very nice about it, but he basically said: We are not going to do that.  I renewed the request here yesterday on the floor, and he said: No, we are not going to do that.  I am generally one who thinks it is very important for us to communicate, collaborate, cooperate around here, as I think most of my colleagues would attest, but in this case, I don't think we made an unreasonable request of the nominee. And I think to block access to these emails--even when petitioned under the Oklahoma FOIA law, backed up by our support--for nothing to happen is just wrong. That is just wrong.  So hopefully when the judge has this hearing later this afternoon--actually, in 2 hours--we will find out a bit more as to whether the AG's office is going to be asked to turn these emails over and make them public with that information. I hope the answer will be yes. We will see.  I asked Mr.Pruitt 52 questions on December 28 and asked they be responded to by January 9. January 9 came and went, and we were told maybe we would get the responses at the hearing we were going to have on January 18. We had the hearing on January 18, and some of the specific questions were answered, some not, but we submitted as a committee some 1,000 additional questions for the record. That is a lot of questions. I suggested to the committee chairman he give the nominee a reasonable amount of time to respond to those questions. The chairman, in the interest of moving things along, I think, gave the nominee 2 days, which is, in my view, not nearly enough.  If we go back several years ago, the last EPA Administrator was a woman named Gina She was asked a number of questions. She was actually asked more questions, I think 1,400 questions, which is several hundred more than Scott Pruitt but a lot of questions. She did not have enough time to answer the questions, and a little extra time, maybe a week or so, was granted. She answered the questions, as I understand, fully, completely, and directly. I will read some of the questions we asked of Scott Pruitt later today, later tonight, with examples of the kind of answers he provided. Some were reasonably complete, but too many were evasive, indirect, or just nonresponsive. Maybe that is because the chairman only gave him a couple days to respond. That is not the way we ought to be about the business.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

8526,topic-id,1755,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to speak in opposition to the nomination of the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency which we all know as the  My concern--I have a number of them, but the principal concern of Mr.Pruitt's nomination is rooted in his record, which I believe is totally inconsistent with the mission of the That mission is to protect human health and the environment. We know the EPA achieves this core goal through the development and enforcement of standards to protect children and families from exposure to dangerous pollutants in our air and water.  Protection of human health means ensuring that our children have clean air and clean water, tackling climate change, which leads to the kind of food insecurity that causes malnutrition in children throughout the world.  I have to say that as a Pennsylvanian, I think I have an obligation to not only speak about these issues but to fight on behalf of policies that will advance the knowledge and mission of the EPA but will be consistent with the directive I am obligated to follow in my State's constitution. In Pennsylvania, if you go back to the founding of Pennsylvania forward, we had many generations, especially through the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, throughout most of the 1800s and into the 1900s, until about the midcentury point, where we didn't do a very good job of protecting our air and water and human health because we let one or another industry pretty much do whatever they wanted until the modern era. Fortunately, since that time, Pennsylvania has made a lot of progress. One of the measures of that progress and something I am bound by is a provision of the State's constitution, article I, section 27, that says people shall ``have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment.''  That constitutional provision goes on to talk about each of us as citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania being trustees of the environment--especially and ever more so if you are a part of State government, and I would argue the Federal Government as well. To say I feel an obligation is a major understatement. I think I am bound by that, and that enters into my determination and analysis of Mr.Pruitt's record.  We know in recent years the EPA, acting under the authority it is granted through laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, has developed a number of important standards to advance these priorities--rules like the mercury and air toxics standards, the cross-state air pollution rule, the ozone rule, the new source performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry, the Clean Power Plan, which is meant to obviously focus our policy on climate change, and other policies to reduce exposure to pollutants like methane, volatile organic compounds, mercury, and carbon pollution itself.  According to the American Lung Association's ``State of the Air 2016'' report, these rules reduce the likelihood of premature death, asthma attacks, lung cancer, and heart disease. I would hope that if you have a series of measures in place that reduce the likelihood of asthma attacks, lung cancer, heart disease, and premature death--I would hope we would not only advance those policies but make sure they are not destroyed, undermined, or compromised. It is just common sense to make sure we regulate pollutants like lead, mercury, arsenic, and acid gases, just by way of example.  Yet Mr.Pruitt, who is the attorney general of Oklahoma, filed 14 lawsuits against the EPA to halt the regulation of these pollutants that threaten our children's health. Mr.Pruitt has stood up for the interests of oil and gas companies but has failed to defend, in my judgment, the most vulnerable members of our society, or at least not defend them to the extent that I would hope he would, not only as attorney general of Oklahoma but as the EPA Administrator were he to be confirmed.  When asked during his confirmation to name one clean air or clean water regulation he supported, he couldn't name one.  I believe his record is clear. He fought to dismantle the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, anti-pollution programs to target ozone and mercury in the air, the agreement to clean up the Chesapeake Bay--which I will get to in a moment--and has even denied the science of climate change. Suffice it to say, I have a number of basic concerns about his record and what he would do were he to be confirmed.  One example of the concerns I have involve the Chesapeake Bay with regard to impact in Although Pennsylvania doesn't border the Chesapeake, the Pennsylvania Susquehanna River is the bay's largest source of freshwater. Improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay requires a sustained, coordinated commitment from all of the States in the watershed. I have repeatedly written to the U.Department of Agriculture for increased funding and technical assistance for farmers in Pennsylvania so Pennsylvania can continue to improve the health of the Susquehanna River and the bay.  Pennsylvania has made great strides in addressing the issue of nutrient and sediment runoff into the Chesapeake Bay, but there is more to be done, and Pennsylvania is far from meeting its 2005 Chesapeake Bay pollution reduction goals.  Ensuring that all States in the watershed are coordinated and meeting their commitments is exactly the type of role the EPA should be filling. Mr.Pruitt called the EPA's Chesapeake Bay TMDL standard ``the culmination of the EPA's decade-long attempt to control exactly how States achieve federal water quality requirements under the Clean Water Act, and marks the beginning of the end of meaningful state participation in water pollution regulation.''  Well, I disagree. We don't have time to outline all the reasons, but I strongly disagree with that assessment of the EPA's actions with regard to the Chesapeake Bay, but we do have a long way to go to make sure that we keep it clean. So on clean water, I think we have to insist that neither the EPA Administrator nor anyone in Congress does anything compromising when it comes to clean water.  Climate change. This fall I had an opportunity to spend time in Pennsylvania with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, one of the leaders in the Senate on the issue of climate change. We did a tour, and one of the places we went was the John Heinz National Wildlife It is America's first urban refuge named after one of my predecessors, Senator Heinz, who tragically died in 1991, but his work on the environment is remembered in places like this wildlife refuge. This is a public space that allows us to enjoy wildlife, outdoor recreation, and environmental education opportunities right outside of a major city--in this case, And this refuge also plays a vital role in climate change resiliency.  Marshes help to filter pollutants from water and can absorb water during heavy rain events, thus helping to reduce the magnitude of flooding. However, the refuge is facing a number of environmental stressors.  Sea level rise could have serious consequences for this fresh water marsh. Not only would rising sea levels lead to the loss of undeveloped dry land and habitat for wildlife, but increased salinity could change the plant makeup of this marsh at the wildlife refuge.  According to EPA, Pennsylvania's climate has warmed more than half a degree Fahrenheit in just the last century. Sea level has also risen nearly 1 foot over the past century, according[[Page S1253]]to NOAA, measured by the tidal gauge in That means that significant portions of the city of Philadelphia could be underwater, including the Philadelphia International Airport, if we fail to act.  We know that 2016 was the warmest year on record for a third year in a row. Also, climate change is not some distant possibility in Pennsylvania or throughout the Nation; it is real, and we are already feeling the effects of climate change.  I will close with one story from one mother who talks about air quality, or the impact of bad air quality and the issue of climate change itself. Jacqueline Smith-Spade, a mother from Philadelphia, recently wrote to me about her 6-year-old son Jonas's struggle with asthma and the emotional and financial toll it takes on her family:       Every time there is an extreme or irregular climate shift,      I can pretty much predict that my son is going to end up in      the emergency room due to the effect of air quality.  She goes on to say later in the letter:       I routinely check the air quality to help predict what type      of day my son and my family might have: With or without      nebulizer?       The physical toll on Jonas also creates a financial burden      on my family. The emergency visits cost $100 each time we go;      $30 copays for each specialist visit; $15 copays for each      pediatrician visit.  She goes on to say:       This is not cheap; however, my insurance greatly helps to      reduce the costs.  She worries, of course, about what might happen on healthcare, but I will not read all of those portions.  She concludes this part of the letter this way:       A reduction in air pollution and climate change will make      life for my 7-year-old son, Jonas, much easier. His reactions      to those changes will be reduced. It will also save my family      countless dollars, stress, and panic attacks.  So said one mom about her son  What we must do, and especially what Mr.Pruitt must do, were he to be confirmed, is to answer her questions--to answer her questions, Jacqueline's questions, and the concerns she has about her son She is not only a taxpayer, but she is someone who will be impacted directly by the actions and the policies that come from this administration as well as the EPA itself.  So I believe that Mr.Pruitt, if he were to be confirmed, must meet the expectations of Jonas and his mother. He works for them, or will work for them, were he to be confirmed.  I know I am out of time. I will just conclude with this: There are a long series of reasons, some of which I wasn't able to get to today, that undergird and form the foundation of my decision not to support the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the next EPA  With that, I yield the floor.

8559,topic-id,396,"I thank Mr.Bilirakis for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, as a combat veteran, I am deeply concerned that the men and women of our Armed Forces continue to struggle to find jobs upon their return to civilian life. These individuals have not only displayed great courage in serving their country, but have acquired certain skills that make them ideal candidates for employment.  I am not going to go over many of the things that were said about how the program is an incentive, as I think that has already been covered. I just want to underscore the fact that this is a problem. It is not a new problem. You can have the statistics, but one has to ask oneself: Why do we have a lower percentage of veterans who are getting the jobs?[[Page H1111]]  As was already mentioned, I am a product of the Vietnam war; and the veterans who were getting out there, a lot of people were afraid to hire them. They didn't know whether they would be recalled back into the service, and they didn't know whether they had post-traumatic stress disorder. They were not going to take a chance on them, and that was sad. That was many, many years ago, but the stats don't lie.  I am very, very supportive. I get passionate about these programs because the bottom line is we have to make sure that we take care of the troops, and this is a bill that, with the cooperation of private industry, has those incentives built in there. I am optimistic. We had bipartisan support the last time. We went all the way up there and were waiting the last time for the Senate--holding our breath. Everybody knows you don't always get what you want. I am not going to give up and neither will the people who have been supporting this bill because we are all very, very passionate about veterans.  I thank Chairman I thank Ranking Member Walz for his great support and military service. I thank Representative Tulsi Gabbard for, once again, being the original cosponsor of this important legislation and for always being there for the veterans and the military. I also thank Congressman Bilirakis for his great support.  Once again, this passed out of the House last November and had unanimous support. I urge my colleagues to once again vote in favor of this bill.  ",CREC-2017-02-13-pt1-PgH1109.txt,2103,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,13.0,March

8540,topic-id,1120,"Mr.President, I want to initially begin by thanking my colleague from Oklahoma for graciously allowing me to proceed first ahead of him. He is, as ever, a terrific colleague. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from I, too, led a bipartisan delegation--two Republican House Members and two Senate Democrats--to Eastern European in August and observed many of the same issues and concerns that she just raised and have joined her, along with 10 Republican Senators and 8 other Democratic Senators, in the legislation she mentioned. I think this is an important issue on which all of us should focus.  Mr.President, let me turn to the matter at hand, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the director of the I thank my colleagues, many of whom have come to the floor to speak about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, and most essentially, my senior Senator and friend from my home State of Delaware, Tom Carper, ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who has ably led this fight.  I am glad to be able to join my colleagues to make clear why, in my view, someone who does not believe in a core Federal role in protecting the environment is not the right person to lead the Federal Agency charged with just that mission. It is possible that we in this Chamber have now forgotten why the Environmental Protection Agency was created in the first place. The idea of Federal protection of our environment really started to take hold when the Cuyahoga River caught fire, again, in June of 1969. The public outrage that rightfully followed this near-spontaneous combustion of a river helped lead to the EPA's creation in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Air Act the same year and the Clean Water Act in 1972.  Now, nearly a half century later, it is precisely because these laws and others like them have been successful in making us healthier and safer that it is easy to forget why we need them.  Institutions like the EPA don't run themselves. The environment does not protect itself, and big oil and gas and coal companies certainly don't police themselves. That is why the EPA exists. You would certainly hope that at the very least the Administrator of that Agency would support that core mission. Yet this evening we are considering the nomination of someone whose main experience with environmental protection at the Federal level is filing lawsuits against the Federal Environmental Protection  In fact, he has filed 14 of those lawsuits in just 6 years as attorney general of the State of That is not all he has done. Scott Pruitt, in his confirmation hearing, refused to recuse himself from consideration of future cases which he brought against the EPA if confirmed.  Mr.Pruitt has also suggested that Senators who want more information about the details of his record should file FOIA requests rather than providing that information voluntarily. He has described himself as ``a leading advocate against the Federal EPA's activist agenda.'' Scott Pruitt has not been able to name in confirmation hearings one single environmental protection statute he supports. In my view, that is unacceptable for a State attorney general let alone someone nominated to be our Nation's highest ranking environmental protection official.  Mr.Pruitt's disdain for the core mission of the EPA leaves me without a doubt that he is unfit to take on this important role, but that is not all. Scott Pruitt either ignores or is ignorant of the core and important science of climate change, mercury, lead exposure, ocean acidification, to name just a few of many topics uncovered in his confirmation hearing.  Mr.Pruitt acknowledges the climate is changing but says the role, the influence of human activity is ``subject to debate.'' I am here to say this evening, that is simply not true. Only in an alternative universe, based on alternative facts, is the human impact on climate change still subject to debate. That is like saying that Scott Pruitt is fit to lead the EPA is subject to debate. I think after an exhaustive confirmation hearing and a review on the floor of the facts, it is not. It is simply not true.  Scott Pruitt also led a lawsuit against EPA rules that would reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired powerplants. He argued it was too expensive, too burdensome, but he also questioned whether mercury itself was[[Page S1267]]harmful to health. On that issue, the science is clear. Mercury has devastating effects on the development of the human nervous system.  Does Mr.Pruitt not get that or does he not care? Those are pressing questions for me. During his confirmation process, Mr.Pruitt was confused about ocean acidification, a process explained by very basic science. A question I was left with was whether Mr.Pruitt just did not get it or just did not care.  In that same hearing, he made statements that indicated he was unfamiliar with the Federal standards regarding lead in drinking water. I had to ask myself whether he simply has not heard of Flint, MI, or was not concerned.  My office alone has received nearly 1,000 calls and emails from Delawareans expressing concern about Scott Pruitt and the future of the EPA under his potential leadership, expressing concern and opposition. Delawareans have reached out to me saying they are worried about their kids with asthma; they are worried about clean drinking water for their families; they are worried about protecting our rivers, our wetlands, and other outdoor spaces in Delaware and around the country.  With Scott Pruitt potentially at the helm of the EPA, they are right to be worried. Let me end by sharing a brief excerpt of a letter from one of my constituents who lives in my hometown of Wilmington, She wrote:       Please vote against Scott Pruitt as leader of the Our      children's future, their health and well-being, and their      right to inherit a world we have not irreversibly destroyed      may depend on it.

I intend to vote against Scott If my colleagues in the Senate really want to stop pollution, we can start by keeping Scott Pruitt from going to lead the  Our environment should not be for sale, should not be neglected, and should not be turned aside from being the core mission of the Environmental Protection I think we all should stand firm against the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead that important  I yield the floor.

8527,topic-id,1910,"Mr.President, today is February 16, 2017. President Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2017.  For the past several weeks now, we have come to the floor and talked about the slow pace at which the Senate has considered and voted on the President's nominees for his Well, there is good reason for that because one of our roles is to consider and vote on advisers selected by the President, regardless of political party, and to help this new administration lead the country.  President Obama, to his credit, after the election, sat down with President-Elect Trump and said he was committed to a peaceful transition of power from his administration to the Trump administration. But, apparently, some of our colleagues didn't get the memo. We continue to slog along at the slowest pace since George Washington to vote on nominees to the President's  The reason it has gone on so slowly is clear by now. It is because our friends across the aisle are still upset and have not yet reconciled themselves with the results of the election on November 8. They just kind of can't get over it. Yes, they are being encouraged by the radical elements of their party who don't want us to fulfill our responsibilities, who don't want a new President to have the Cabinet that he needs in order to govern the country. Yes, there are some who want to halt our work in this Chamber and perpetuate dysfunction. They don't want us to focus on legislating because they want to keep us tied up in the confirmation process.  I will just interject right here, as I have said before, that we know these nominees will be confirmed because, thanks to the nuclear option under Senator Reid, the previous Democratic leader, all it takes is 51 votes to confirm a nominee to a Cabinet post. But the fact is, the country needs a functioning We need a functioning executive branch.  So I hope our colleagues across the aisle will understand soon that if they want to be effective--if they want to actually move the needle and help those who have entrusted them with the future of this country--then we need to turn from gridlock to action.  Last Congress, even under President Obama in the White House, we did not let partisan dysfunction keep us from working together. There is a difference between elections and governing. But, for some reason, too many people want to keep relitigating the election and not allow us to actually govern.  Of course, during the Obama administration, Republicans had many points of departure from the Obama administration, and we used the tools available to us to provide the oversight and ask the critical questions that the American people demanded. But our friends across the aisle are now being tempted to shut down the government, to run away from policy debates, and point fingers. Why? Because it is always easier to throw stones than it is to actually accomplish something--roll up your sleeves, focus on the task, and turn to legislating.  Yes, it may be easier just to criticize and to obstruct, but it is not the right thing for the American people. Our colleagues across the aisle know that, but, as I said earlier, they are being unduly influenced by some of the radical elements in their political base who will not let them do it or who say that if you do cooperate on a bipartisan basis and actually do your job, then we are going to recruit people to run against you in a primary.  Well, that is part of the risk we all take. We didn't come here to appease a portion of our political base and neglect our most basic duties as Members of the U.Again, I would point to last Congress and the work we did together on a bipartisan basis, I might add, as evidence of what you can accomplish when you try to do that.  The 114th Congress, after the 2014 election, saw a new majority, a new Republican leadership, and we did our best to help restore order to this Chamber and get it working again after years of dysfunction. Under the previous regime, Members of both the majority and minority parties were actually prevented from coming to the floor and offering legislative ideas in the form of amendments and getting votes on them, but that backfired when some of our colleagues who were running for reelection in 2014 realized that they had very little to show the voters by way of accomplishment--even those in the majority party, the Democratic Party, at that time. So one would have thought that there would be some lessons learned there.  In the last Congress--in the 114th Congress that began 2 years ago--we voted on legislative ideas from both sides of the aisle with more than 250 rollcall votes. That represented a sea change from the previous administration and the way Senator Reid ran things.  We were able to get the Senate functioning as the Founders intended, and that led to big results for the American people. We took care of big, intractable problems that had trouble getting anywhere during the previous For example, we passed a transportation bill--the highway bill--to help Americans deal with safety on the roadway, to deal with concerns about pollution due to congestion and people in gridlock, and we helped our economy in the process. That was a big, important bill. That was the first time we had been able to pass a long-term highway bill in about 30 different, separate attempts where we had patched the funding mechanism for 6 months or a year, which made it nearly impossible for our highway departments across the country to actually plan. It actually ended up being more expensive and less effective than it would be with a multiyear highway bill, which we[[Page S1254]]passed. So that was a big bipartisan accomplishment.  We also made great progress in reforming our public education system by passing, again, on a bipartisan basis, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which went a long way to devolving power from here in Washington, DC, back to the States, back to local school districts, back to parents and teachers--something that, fortunately, we were able to agree upon on a bipartisan basis. That change was applauded by my constituents back home, and, I believe, people around the country.  We also made great headway in making our country safer and our government more just by taking up and passing legislation to support victims of abuse and violence and to craft laws to better equip our law enforcement to handle growing threats.  For example, we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act 99 to 0. Some people say that nothing ever gets done in Washington; well, 99 to 0--it is hard to beat that, except by maybe 100 to 0, but we will take it.  That law was signed into law by President Obama 2 years ago, and it is helping victims of human trafficking get the healing and recovery they need, while also providing help to law enforcement to help root out the people who patronize modern day slavery, which is what human trafficking amounts to.  We also, on a bipartisan basis, reauthorized the Justice for All Act to strengthen victims' rights in court and increase access to restitution and services that can help them recover. It helps reduce the national backlog in untested rape kits, forensic evidence collected after a sexual assault that is necessary to identify the assailant through the use of DNA testing. That was really important, after we heard the horror stories of as many as 400,000 untested rape kits in laboratories or evidence lockers--evidence which was critical to identifying the assailant; many times they were serial assailants. In other words, they didn't just attack one time, they attacked multiple times over the years--and to get them off the streets. That type of evidence is also very important in exonerating the innocent because if we can exclude someone from one of these terrible assaults, that means a person who is innocent of the crime will be free.  We also passed a bill called the POLICE Act, signed into law last summer, so our first responders and law enforcement officers can learn the latest techniques to deal with violence so they are ready to face the unimaginable or previously unimaginable threats in our communities.  I could go on and on, but I will just mention a few more. We passed bipartisan legislation to combat opioid abuse and heroin addiction, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery We passed laws to make our government more transparent so it is more accountable to the public and to voters. We helped capitalize on our God-given natural resources by lifting the crude oil export ban, for example--something important not only to domestic producers and job creation here but also to our friends and allies around the world who frequently depend on a single source for their energy. Unfortunately, people like Vladimir Putin in Russia have discovered you can use that sole source of energy as a weapon by threatening to cut it off.  The reason I mention some of these accomplishments is to make the point that nothing happens in Congress, nothing happens in the Federal Government, unless it is bipartisan.  It is one thing to fight hard in an election and try to win the election so you can gain the privilege of actually being in the majority or having the White House, but after the election is over, our responsibilities shift to governing. Right now, our friends across the aisle are continuing to obstruct and drag their feet and make it impossible for the President to get the Cabinet he needs in order to get the government up and running.  We need to return to the pattern we established in the last Congress, to work together, to build consensus, to help make America stronger, our citizens safer, and our laws a better service to all the people. I would plead with our colleagues across the aisle to stop the dysfunction, stop wanting to relitigate the outcome of the election. You can't. It is over. We know what the outcome was. They need to move on, and we need to move on--not just for the political parties we are members of, not just for the benefit of those elected here in Washington but for the benefit of 320-some-odd million people whom we have the responsibility of representing. Instead of foot-dragging, obstruction, and dysfunction, let us fight, as we always have, for those people we represent and work together to find common ground where we can to put forward legislation that serves them well.  I hope our colleagues across the aisle would remember those lessons they learned in the 2014 election; that dysfunction is bad politics. It does not help their political cause. I understand the temptation of wanting to yield to the most radical elements in a political party, but we are elected to the Senate for 6-year terms to be that cooling saucer, to try to have debate and deliberation, to try to work out the hard problems. That is our responsibility, and just to blindly obstruct when you know you can't change the outcome--particularly when it comes to the President getting the Cabinet he has chosen and he deserves--makes no sense whatsoever.

8468,topic-id,384,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.1365, the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation  When the Department of Homeland Security was established in 2002, it was understood that the mission of safeguarding the American people would be[[Page H2308]]a complex one. Today, 15 years later, the ever-changing nature of the terrorist threat and its landscape has demanded that DHS be more innovative. In the past 3 years, the Department has actively worked to carry out its procurement process in new and innovative ways.  The Acquisition Innovations in Motion program, launched in 2015, is a framework for coordinated industry engagement in which opportunities, challenges, and strategies are discussed to identify acquisition solutions and foster greater efficiency and effectiveness.  A key component of this program is a Procurement Innovation Lab called PIL is a virtual testing environment that experiments with innovative techniques to assess whether they can be effectively integrated into DHS' procurement process. To date, PIL is credited with reducing award times, the integration of existing flexibilities that are in use in other portions of the Federal Government, and improved acquisition training.  Results, case studies, and lessons learned from the PIL process are regularly shared throughout DHS through webinars and the internal web portal. These activities facilitate a continuous learning culture that enhances the DHS mission of support.  I introduced this bill, H.1365, to institutionalize DHS' acquisition innovation efforts by authorizing such activity by the Under Secretary of Specifically, my legislation authorizes robust testing, development, and distribution of best practices and acquisitions throughout the Department, as well as performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of such efforts.  Enactment of this bill will help ensure that this successful acquisition management technique continues. This bill was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month.  Mr.Speaker, DHS' approach to acquisitions not only accommodates the Department's unique mission, but it supports our responsibility to the management of taxpayer dollars.  This bill codifies a pathway to developing and implementing innovative approaches that serve the Department's acquisition challenges through collaboration and efficiency.

8501,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I recently read a story in the Wall Street Journal that I thought was so alarming it demanded action. Here is the headline: ``Marathon Pharmaceuticals to Charge $89,000 for Muscular Dystrophy Drug After 70-Fold Increase.''  Yes, that is $89,000 a year, and, yes, that is a 70-fold increase--70-fold, as in 7,000 percent.  For those of you who have not read the article, here is the story. There is a rare disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It affects about 12,000 young men in the United Most of them, unfortunately, end up dying in their twenties and thirties because of it.  We don't have a cure yet for Until recently, there was not even a treatment with FDA approval. So, for many years, patients and parents have been importing a drug called deflazacort, a steroid, from other countries. Even though it is not a cure, it at least helps treat symptoms and has been a welcome relief to many families.  Well, technically it is illegal to import a drug that doesn't have FDA approval. But there is a catch. The FDA does not quite enforce the ban against all unapproved drugs. In fact, it has issued regulatory guidance saying that you can get an exemption and buy an unapproved drug from overseas if you meet five conditions. First, you have to have a serious illness for which there is no other treatment available. Second, you can't sell the drug. Third, you can't pose an unreasonable risk to your health. Fourth, it has to be for you and you alone. Fifth, you can't buy more than a 3-month supply.  All of that sounds fair enough. But if someone comes along and gets FDA approval for their version of the exact same drug, the exact same chemical composition of the drug that is being imported, then you cannot buy it overseas anymore. That is exactly what happened here.  This was not a new drug. This was not a medical breakthrough. This was not a scientific advance. This was, plain and simple, an arbitrage opportunity. Other people had already gone to the trouble of making a drug that worked, but if you paid the expenses of getting FDA approval, you would essentially buy for yourself monopoly pricing power. That is what other companies missed, and now, to cover the costs of going through that approval process, Marathon is increasing the price from roughly $1,500 a year to $89,000 a year.  I don't think it is an overstatement to say that this turn of events is nothing short of outrageous. It defeats the very purposes of our FDA laws. The reason we offer people the chance to create a monopoly is to encourage innovation and medical breakthroughs, to generate new drugs that are going to solve diseases or illnesses.  What we are saying is, if you go to the pain and expense of developing a new treatment, we will give you the sole rights to sell it for a number of years so you can recover your costs, and, therefore, we will encourage more medical breakthroughs to alleviate the pain and suffering of the American people. In other words, monopoly rights are not merit badges. They are not a reward for business smarts. They are supposed to serve the interests of patients. They are supposed to expand access to treatment. But in this case, what we see in our system is, in fact, restricting access and driving up the price for that coverage.  I understand that many people with Duchenne are happy that Marathon has done this because now that the drug has FDA approval, insurance companies will likely cover it--unlike before when people had to pay out of pocket, meaning that poor kids didn't get access to deflazacort, whereas upper middle-class and rich kids typically did.  I also know that Marathon has promised to increase spending on research on a new drug and to help people of limited means afford that treatment. That, too, is all to the good.  I am not casting aspersions on anyone's motives here, but let's be real. Someone has to pay the full price of this drug at $89,000 a year. We have a drug that used to be available for $1,500 a year, and now it is $89,000 a year. Whatever happened, that is a systemwide failure. We as a Congress have to address it.  There is simply no getting around the fact that this story should never have been written in the first place because it should have never happened in the first place. We should be channeling peoples' ambition and entrepreneurial spirit into finding cures, not finding new and clever ways to make a profit. That is what our food and drug laws are designed to do. That is what they have clearly failed to do in this instance.  I just want to say that I am not going to let this story disappear.

Republican amendments at the committee markup strengthened the underlying bill by encouraging DHS to obtain feedback from the private sector and incorporate this feedback into future efforts.

8496,topic-id,1852,"Mr.President, I rise again to speak about the epidemic of gun violence in the city of Chicago and across  The American Medical Association has declared gun violence as a public health crisis in Every day, almost 300 men, women, and children are shot in this Gun violence touches every American community, but no community has suffered more than the city of  I am honored to represent that city. I love it, and I think it is a great city. I spend a lot of time there to get to know the people who were born there and live their lives there and call it home. It is a great honor to call it part of my State that I am honored to represent.  The stories that are coming out of the city of Chicago are heartbreaking stories--and none worse than this week. This week there was a slaughter of the innocents. In a 4-day period earlier this week, three beautiful children under the age of 12 were fatally shot.  On Saturday night, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes, sitting in her mom's car, was shot in the head and killed. A 19-year-old suspect in custody has been charged. He reported that he was shooting from across the street at rival gang members, and a stray bullet hit She died on Tuesday morning.  On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was shot while playing basketball in the West Englewood neighborhood. She passed away just yesterday.  On Tuesday at 1:30 in the afternoon, 2-year-old Lavontay White was shot and killed while sitting in the car with his pregnant aunt and uncle. Lavontay's uncle was also killed. His aunt was wounded.  These shootings are senseless, devastating, and heartbreaking. Already this year there have been over 400 shootings in Chicago--so far this year. That is after there were more than 4,300 shootings last year.  My thoughts and prayers, of course, go to the victims and their families. I have attended so many marches and parades, funerals, and memorial services. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need to do something to reduce this epidemic of gun violence. There have been too many funerals, too many families who have lost that baby they loved, too many children who suffered the physical and mental trauma of gunshot wounds and witnessing violence. Many of these shootings could have been prevented, but it is going to take changes in our laws and changes in our attitude for that to happen.  We have absurd loopholes in our gun laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on guns. We have obvious gaps in our gun background check system. We have inadequate Federal laws to stop gun trafficking and straw purchases of guns. These factors allow a flood of illicit guns to come into Chicago from other towns and States, from gun shows in neighboring States where there is no background check. These drug gangs drive over to these locations and fill up the trunks of their cars with guns to take them and sell them in the neighborhoods to kids who shoot and kill one another day in and day out.  We have gun dealers--federally licensed gun dealers--who look the other way when someone comes in to make a straw purchase. That is the purchase of a gun that the purchaser is not going to use but is going to give it to somebody who is prohibited from buying a gun.  In light of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, Congress should be working around the clock to fix these gaps in our Federal law. But the Republican-controlled Senate is doing nothing to address gun violence in Chicago or anywhere else. Instead, look at what we just did yesterday. Just yesterday, this Senate, on this floor, voted to weaken the gun background check system instead of strengthening it. It is hard to understand how the Republican Party can have its priorities so wrong when it comes to gun violence.  We can respect Second Amendment rights of individuals. We can respect the rights of people to own a gun for self-defense, for sporting and hunting purposes. I have gone hunting. I have used a firearm. I complied with every law in the books, all of them. The hunters who were with me did too.  Why is it so hard to ask before we sell a gun to someone whether they have a criminal record, whether they are buying it for another person who might have a criminal record, or whether they have a history of mental instability, which would disqualify them from owning a gun?  We are facing a crisis in Chicago and across the Nation because of this violence. We in Congress have a responsibility to do everything we can at the Federal level to protect our constituents, our neighbors, from getting shot. We can't ignore this responsibility, and we certainly shouldn't be weakening gun laws as the Senate did yesterday.  We also need the Federal Government to be an engaged partner with cities like Chicago to help reduce violence and expand economic options in depressed neighborhoods. You can pick out three neighborhoods in the city of Chicago that account for almost 50 percent of gun violence--three neighborhoods. I visited some of them. They warned me: Don't get out of the car. They are right. Random gunfire is a reality of life in those neighborhoods. We know where they are. We know where the shooters live. We know where the victims are. We can do more.  President Trump sends out a lot of tweets. He likes to tweet about Chicago, and I am not quite sure why. Tweeting doesn't save lives. Saying that you are going to send in the Feds may be one of those short tweets that is catchy, but it doesn't mean a damned thing to the people who are being shot and are dying in the city of  Last week I joined my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth, and we sent a letter to the President asking him to do more than tweet when it comes to  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     President Donald Trump,     The White House,     Washington,       Dear President Trump: During the 2016 presidential campaign      and in numerous tweets and comments since the election, you      have lamented the recent surge of gun violence in Chicago and      said the federal government could help stop the violence.      While the level of shootings and homicides is clearly      unacceptable, tweeting alone will not fix it. Tweeting does      not break cycles of violence; tweeting does not help lift      people out of poverty; tweeting does not save lives. We urge      you instead to provide a surge in federal support and      resources for Chicago to reduce violence and expand economic      opportunities for neglected communities.       Public safety is primarily a local responsibility, but the      federal government must be an engaged partner in public      safety efforts alongside local officials, law enforcement,      and community stakeholders. There is much the federal      government can do to help.       Instead of tweeting, you could begin by directing your      Administration to enhance U.Department of Justice (DOJ)      programs that improve community policing, such as the COPS      Hiring Program to help local police departments put more cops      on the beat, and the Byrne-JAG grant program to enable local      law enforcement to purchase or upgrade equipment. We note      that in his first year in office, President Obama pushed for      a surge in COPS and Byrne-JAG funding through the Recovery      Act and the appropriations process that provided Chicago with      $13.256 million in COPS Hiring funding and $35.637 million in      Byrne-JAG finding. This is more than four times the amount of      COPS funding and 15 times the amount of Byrne-JAG funding      that the City received last year. You could push for a      similar funding surge.       We also urge you to direct DOJ to promote mentoring and job      training programs for youth and the formerly incarcerated. We      are ready to work with you to strengthen the Office of      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to improve      mentoring and violence prevention initiatives and to boost      funding for recidivism reduction programs under the federal      Second Chance We urge you to direct DOJ to abide by its      commitment to help implement policing reforms[[Page S1239]]     recommended by the Department's Civil Rights We      also request your support for legislation to close gaps in      the FBI gun background check system and in federal firearm      laws that enable straw purchasers and gun traffickers to      flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns.       Federal efforts must also transcend law enforcement and      criminal justice programs to focus on causal factors,      including the lack of economic opportunity. We urge the U.     Department of Education and the U.Department of Labor to      prioritize important career and youth training programs that,      if properly funded and expanded, would address the role that      poverty plays in the violence epidemic facing Chicago and      other communities around the country.       Before you send your next tweet, you could request a surge      in additional federal resources for these public safety and      economic development efforts in But so far, your      Administration has refused to commit to spend any additional      resources to combat Chicago's violence and has actually      threatened to cut federal funds for the Now is not the      time for the federal government to abandon its support for      Chicago and its people.       This week, you reportedly attributed Chicago's crime      situation to the presence of undocumented immigrants. This      coincides with your January 25 executive order that makes up      to eight million immigrants priorities for deportation and      seeks to create a mass deportation force by tripling the      number of immigration agents. The vast majority of immigrants      in our country are peaceful and have strong family values,      and studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to      commit serious crimes than native-born individuals. We are      aware of no evidence that undocumented immigrants are      responsible for any significant proportion of the murders in      Chicago, and claims otherwise do nothing but distract from      efforts to meaningfully reduce the City's recent increase in      violence.       We note that you have urged Congress to fund the      construction of a wall on the Southern border that would      reportedly cost at least $21.6 billion, even though the wall      would not fix our broken immigration system and even though      Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800      miles of the border, has said ``building a wall is the most      expensive and least effective way to secure the border.'' If      your Administration were to take even one percent of this      funding and devote the resources instead to help Chicago's      public safety efforts, it would make a dramatic difference in      reducing Chicago's violence. We urge you to reprioritize      federal resources that you would request for wall      construction and commit those resources instead to reducing      gun violence in Chicago and other violence-prevention efforts      around the nation. Doing so could save many more lives than      tweeting.       Thank you for your consideration on this important issue.           Sincerely,     Richard Durbin,       U.    Tammy Duckworth,       U.

I rise today in support of this resolution because it will reverse an unlawful power grab and restore responsible worker health and safety policies.  Article I of the Constitution is clear. It is the Members of this body--the legislative branch--who write the law. Why? Because we are closest to the people and, therefore, more responsive to the needs and demands of those we serve.  It is the responsibility of the executive branch to enforce the laws--not write them. Unfortunately, the previous administration failed to abide by this founding principle. President Obama boasted about his days teaching constitutional law, yet his administration tried time and time again to rewrite the law unilaterally through executive fiat.  The Volks rule is just one example of this unprecedented overreach. Under Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations, employers are required to record injuries and illnesses and retain those records for 5 years. This information has long been used by safety inspectors and employers to identify gaps in safety and enhance protections for workers.  To ensure hazards are addressed in a timely manner, the law explicitly provides a 6-month window under which an employer can be cited for failing to keep proper records--6 months. But never one to let the law stand in the way of its partisan agenda, the Obama administration decided to unfairly target a Louisiana construction company for recordkeeping errors from nearly 5 years earlier.  That's right, 5 years. Not even remotely close to what the law passed by Congress permits. The consequences of this unlawful power grab were predictable. Employers large and small faced significant regulatory confusion and legal uncertainty. Fortunately, a Federal appeals court unanimously struck down this power grab as my colleague from Alabama has cited. Even President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick Garland, referred to OSHA's action as unreasonable.  How did the Obama administration respond to this judicial rebuke? It completely ignored the court's ruling. The agency doubled down on its abuse of power and tried to rewrite the law extending the threat of penalty from 6 months to 5 years.  Again, it is Congress that writes laws, not government agencies. That is precisely why we must support this resolution. By supporting H.83, we will provide more certainty for small businesses and uphold the rule of law. Just as importantly, we must demand a better approach to worker health and safety. To be clear, this rule does nothing--I repeat nothing--to improve the health and safety of America's workers.  Instead of shaming employers, OSHA should collaborate with employers and develop a proactive approach that will keep workers safe. That is exactly what Republicans have demanded for years, and we will continue to demand so in the years ahead no matter which party has the  As my colleague from Alabama has said, this is exactly the appropriate way to block this unlawful rule, not only because the agency has no authority to do what it did, but because it is why we have the  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to block an unlawful rule by voting in favor of H.83.

I know the thought of public health risks like these sound preposterous today, but this was all the case back before the It took parents and regular citizens standing up and demanding better to finally force action. In 1970, President Richard Nixon and a Democratic Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to create the  Let me be clear. The EPA is not perfect. There are many instances when I have stood up to the Agency because I felt its actions were not in the best interests of That said, since the creation of the Agency, the EPA has significantly improved our public health and our environment by cleaning up our air and cleaning up our water.  We still have a lot of work left to do. Yet we are now faced with a President and an EPA nominee who want to gut the Agency and reverse the progress we have made. President Trump has repeatedly attacked environmental protections and the He has called to ``get rid of'' the And during an interview with FOX News, Candidate Trump said of the EPA: ``What they do is a disgrace.'' And now he is in a position to try to implement his stated goal of gutting the EPA--gutting the EPA, that is right. He wants to slash critical public health and environmental safeguards, and to do this, he handpicked Mr. Mr.Pruitt intends to prevent the EPA from protecting public health and the environment by reducing the budget by two-thirds. Trump transition team member Myron Ebell made these plans clear. Mr.Pruitt will cut and then cut some more and then cut some more, until the Agency we trust to keep us safe is no bigger than it was when Richard Nixon was  So what exactly should we cut? Which aspect of public health and our environment is in need of less protection and research? Well, let me tell you about some of the things the EPA has accomplished since its creation.  The EPA helps protect us from toxins. From 1948 to 1988, 30 million homes were treated for termite infestation with two related, very longlasting chemicals: heptachlor and chlordane. These chemicals are among the 12 worst known persistent organic pollutants--a rogues' gallery called the dirty dozen. A long-term study found that millions of Americans have these chemicals in their blood and in their fat and that the higher the levels, the more likely a person is to suffer from dementia, type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, breast cancer, or lymphoma.  The problems arising from heptachlor and chlordane are still with us, but at least they are not getting worse. Why? Because hard work by EPA scientists helped expose the risks of these chemicals and led them to be banned in the United States in 1988. The world didn't catch up to the protection offered to the American people by our EPA until an international ban came into effect in 2001.  The Agency also determined that lead in our paint and lead in our gas caused terrible public health problems, and they got the lead out. In the 1970s, 88 percent of American children had elevated levels of lead in their blood. Now the number is less than 1 percent.  However, we know that the battle against old toxins is far from over, as the disastrous lead poisoning in Flint, MI, tragically reminds us. We also know that new risks appear every year. That is why Congress recently passed bipartisan legislation to allow the EPA to take action on the most concerning toxic chemicals, including asbestos. Slashing the EPA budget endangers future progress and will not make us better off, will not make us safer, will not make our children safer.  The EPA has also made our air cleaner. Thanks to the EPA, we have reduced air pollution--like smog and ozone and particulate matter--by more than 70 percent since 1970, thus preventing millions of asthma attacks, hospital visits, lost workdays, and more than 100,000 premature deaths every year. At the same time, the American economy has grown 240 percent.  The Agency was also instrumental in the phaseout of harmful substances responsible for depleting the ozone layer. The ozone layer shields us from harmful ultraviolet radiation that leads to sunburns or, worse, skin cancer. Thanks to the work of the EPA and other Federal agencies in cooperation with the international community, ozone depletion has now stopped and the layer has begun to regenerate.  The EPA has also made our water cleaner. The Agency invests billions in drinking and wastewater infrastructure every year through the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving These funds are particularly important to rural communities.  What is more, the EPA is actually saving consumers money. Take the fuel efficiency standards that require car companies to manufacture vehicles that go farther on a gallon of gas. These standards both reduce air pollution and save people money. Thanks in part to the EPA, from 1975 to 2013, the average fuel economy of a car sold in the United States more than doubled. Further increases in fuel economy standards under the Obama administration mean that if you buy a new car, you can expect to save an average of $7,300 on gas during the lifetime of that vehicle. As a whole, Americans will save $1.7 trillion at the pump.  This is just a small subset of what the EPA has accomplished over the years to protect public health and the environment. And I didn't even mention cleaning up toxic waste sites or testing foreign products for lead and mercury. But if Mr.Pruitt is confirmed to lead the EPA, all this progress and continued work is at risk.  As the attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt put the will of his corporate donors above the public interest time and time again, suing the Agency 18 times--suing the EPA 18 times--to block clean air and clean water protections. Now Mr.Pruitt wants to run the EPA, but he refuses to say that he will permanently recuse himself from those lawsuits that are still pending. Thus, he would be both the defendant and plaintiff in those cases. This is a bizarre world nomination. We cannot allow this type of conflict of interest at the  As attorney general, he failed to take environmental protections seriously. He dismantled the environmental protection unit within the AG's office, and in particular Mr.Pruitt's record shows a disdain for protecting the air we breathe. He filed three lawsuits to block EPA health standards for smog, soot, mercury, arsenic, lead, and other air pollutants. His actions directly threaten those who suffer from asthma and other lung conditions. We can't go back to the air we had in the 1970s. We can't afford the air Beijing has today.  Mr.Pruitt is so ideologically driven to protect the interests of oil, gas, and other polluters that he even gets in the way of clean energy projects that would create jobs. Take for example the Plains & Eastern Clean Line, a high-voltage transmission project that President Trump has identified as an infrastructure priority. It will bring clean wind power from the heartland to power-hungry cities. As Oklahoma attorney general, Mr.Pruitt did everything he could to kill that very same project.  Even more concerning to me is Mr.Pruitt's years of opposition to the renewable fuel standard, the This program is vital in our fight against dirty air, and it also greatly benefits Minnesota's rural economy. It is certainly better to drive our cars on[[Page S1261]]biofuels from the Midwest than on oil from the Middle I know that Mr.Pruitt pledged during his hearing to honor the RFS, but this same law provides him with an important loophole: The RFS permits the head of the EPA to reduce the congressionally mandated levels of biofuel production. I, for one, do not trust an avid opponent of the RFS to now be responsible for its implementation.  During the confirmation hearings, my Democratic colleagues pushed Mr.Pruitt on climate change. His answers were not reassuring. Unlike our new President, Mr.Pruitt did not call climate change a ``hoax.'' Instead, he was more subtle, repeatedly saying: ``The climate is changing, and human activity impacts are changing climate in some manner.'' Those words are intentionally deceptive. They are meant to sound reasonable but also to excuse inaction. If we look at Mr.Pruitt's record, it shows that he has been steadfastly against action on climate change, including a suit to block the first requirements for powerplants to reduce their carbon emissions. Let me remind you that these requirements are based on Supreme Court rulings from a conservative majority Court at that.  In a 2007 decision, Massachusetts v. the EPA, the Supreme Court found that the EPA had authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air It also directed the EPA to assess whether climate change endangers public health, which the Agency correctly determined it does. The Court further ruled that because of this hazard, the EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gases.  During his hearing, Mr.Pruitt made clear that all he wants to do is transfer more environmental protection duties to the States, but there are two major problems with that. First, 50 States each implementing different requirements is both inefficient and likely to lead to a race to the bottom. There are many States that will be tempted to trade away the long-term public health of their citizens for the quick financial rewards that will come if they are able to lure businesses from other States with the promise of lax environmental regulations.  All Americans deserve a clean environment. If States want to innovate, free them to do better than our national standards, but there needs to be an EPA that can make sure they don't do worse than our national standards.  While my State of Minnesota has been a leader in environmental protection, the second problem with the State-by-State approach is that pollution doesn't respect State boundaries. The people of my State should not suffer ill effects of pollution from States upwind.  Mr.Pruitt also implied during his hearing that the EPA's regulations are killing jobs, suggesting we must either choose employment and economic prosperity or public health and environmental protection, but this is a false choice. We know we can and must in fact have both. Addressing environmental challenges like climate change will not only help prevent unprecedented damage to our economy but will also spur economic growth and innovation.  My home State of Minnesota has shown how we can do this. In 2007, under a Republican Governor, we established a renewable energy standard that produced 25 percent of our power from renewable sources by 2025. We established an energy efficiency resource standard requiring utilities to become a little more efficient every year. We established an aggressive target to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050, and we are national leaders in biodiesel blending requirements. These policies have not led to economic ruin in They have led to economic development--rural economic development--as we harvest the wind and Sun and convert our biomass into energy. We are investing in clean energy technology not only because it cleans up the air but because it creates thousands of jobs. In fact, a clean energy economy now employs more than 50,000 people in Minnesota, and it will continue to grow.  In 2005, 6 percent of Minnesota's electricity came from renewable sources. Today it is almost 25 percent, and we continue to go higher. In addition to good jobs for Minnesotans, this transition brought a 17-percent decline in power sector greenhouse gas emissions during a decade when the population of Minnesota increased 7 percent. It is clear that an EPA led by Mr.Pruitt will not move us in the direction Minnesota is going.  Americans expect and deserve clean water, clean air, and a hospitable environment. Although EPA is far from perfect, the Agency has shown that a cleaner environment is compatible with economic growth. In fact, cleaning the environment helps drive economic growth. We cannot afford to entrust the EPA to Mr.Pruitt or anyone else who has a history of putting polluters' interests above the public's and above the economy as a whole. We cannot afford to entrust this Agency to someone the President has handpicked to slash its budget and to prevent it from carrying out its mission. Mr.Pruitt represents a step backward, not a step forward. He is maybe the last person who should be the next leader of the I will oppose this nomination, and I call on my colleagues to do the same.

This is about our brothers and sisters in uniform--from different generations--who have been honored and thanked for their service in uniform but who, unfortunately, are often forgotten about when they lay that uniform down. Most people aren't aware that every single day roughly 500 veterans are transitioning from military life to civilian life, joining more than 2.9 million veterans who have returned home since 9/11 alone. Through their service and training, these are men and women who are highly trained, who have experience in leading, in making decisions under pressure, in acting and working well as members of a team, and in accomplishing the mission.  Data show that veterans are civic assets in our communities. They have higher rates of voting, of engaging with local governments and community organizations, of participating actively in community service, and more. Together, these qualities make our veterans especially valuable to employers, whether it be in the private sector, in the public sector, or in the nonprofit sector.  Unfortunately, for them, returning to a civilian job market is not as easy as it should be. They often face an unfriendly job market or even an unfriendly culture that doesn't fully understand them and what they bring to the table. Many people don't understand that our veterans are not seeking pity or a handout but are simply looking for an opportunity to continue to serve--to continue to contribute to our communities and to our country.  This legislation is focused on encouraging employers to hire more veterans. We have seen different programs and initiatives in my home State of Hawaii and in States across the country that focus on recruiting and retaining veterans, but the fact is that there are still more than 400,000 unemployed veterans across the country. We need to do more.  This legislation, the HIRE Vets Act, gets directly at this need by setting up an incentive system to encourage employers to hire and retain veterans. It creates a standard of recognition for employers who go the extra mile to recruit and retain veterans and provide services that support our veteran community.  We came together at the end of last year and passed this legislation unanimously. I am hopeful that my colleagues will once again stand and pass this important legislation and move it along through the Senate and to the President's desk for his signature.

8528,topic-id,2378,"Mr.President, there are few things that I enjoy more than bragging about my hometown. I live in a little town called Yuma, CO, out in the Eastern It is a town of about 3,500 people. If maybe you overexaggerate a little bit, it reaches 4,000. It is out in the middle of the High Plains of Colorado, 4,000 feet in elevation, 40 miles or so from the Kansas-Nebraska border. It is a farming community, 100 percent farming. Everything related to the town is farming. Even the clothing stores are related to farming because if you don't have a strong agriculture economy, nobody is buying blue jeans, nobody is going up to the car dealership to buy a pickup if the bushel of corn isn't priced right. So everything we do in that town is related to agriculture and farming.  My family comes from a background of farm equipment business and started a business--101 years old this year--by my great-grandfather. My time working in the dealership started roughly when I was in seventh, eighth grade. They let me do some very complicated tasks, high-skill tasks they let me perform: cleaning the bathroom, sweeping the floors. I did that throughout my time in eighth grade, high school, and college. If I go back today, I am sure they would let me do the same job, clean the bathrooms and sweep the floors. Part of that is because I was selling the wrong parts to a lot of farmers who would come into the dealership. Maybe they were just keeping me off the parts counter for the time being. In fact, maybe that is why people voted for me, to get me off the parts counter and quit selling the wrong parts.  Over my time working at the dealership, we witnessed a lot of good times in agriculture. I can remember one time going into my dad's and granddad's office and saying: You know what, the economy is really good. The price of corn is really high right now. We ought to order a whole bunch of farm equipment--a whole bunch of pieces of implements, tillage equipment, tractors, combines--and have them on the lot so we can take advantage of the good times in agriculture.  My granddad paused and looked at my dad and said: No, I don't think we should do that because I don't think times are going to be good next year.  They were right. This was back in probably the mid-1990s. They had seen it coming because of their experience in the business, the ebbs and flows of agriculture, the good times and the bad times. They were able to recognize, through their own experience, what different economic indicators meant to them and how they could forecast, using their experience, what was going to happen in the farm world the next year. So they decided not to order all that brandnew equipment. They decided not to order the tractors, the combines, and the tillage equipment. It was a good thing because the next year wasn't that great. If this 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid would have had his way, we would have had a whole lot of iron[[Page S1255]]we were paying interest on that year without being able to sell it.  Colorado is pretty blessed, with 4,000 companies involved in agriculture, 173,000 jobs in Colorado directly involved in agriculture. The State has more than 35,000 farms and 31 million acres used for farming and ranching. If we look at the Colorado business economic outlook, the net farm income of ranchers and farmers in 2016 is estimated this year to be the lowest it has been since 1986, and the projections for 2017 are even lower.  I grew up as a kid in the 1980s, watching perhaps the hardest times agriculture in the United States had faced in decades, watching a lot of people I knew my whole life going out of business, people having to sell the farm because of what was happening in the 1980s, leading to a banking crisis in agriculture in the 1980s, watching banks I had grown up with close.  I am concerned in this country that we are going to see the same thing again, beginning in 2016, into 2017, and then into 2018 next year. I am very worried that those tough times we saw in the 1980s, and some of the tough with the good times we saw in the 1990s, and some really good years a few years ago are going to seem like distant memories come later this summer and into next year if we don't do something.  I had the opportunity to visit with the Colorado commissioner of agriculture in my office last week, a gentleman by the name of Don Don Brown is from my hometown of Yuma, It has done pretty well for itself, 3,000 people. The State commissioner of agriculture is from my hometown. The previous commissioner of agriculture, a gentleman by the name of John Stoltz, was from my hometown of Both of them grew up in agriculture in that area, understanding what it is like on the High Plains, understanding what it is like to live through good times and bad times. Both of them today I think would tell you, they are very concerned as well about what happens over the next year, the next 2 years.  It wasn't that long ago when we saw some of the highest priced commodities this country has ever seen, at least in a very long time--the golden years of agriculture, some people said--where corn and wheat were priced high. People were able to pay their bills and buy new equipment. Commodity prices don't always stay that high though. The one thing a farmer will tell you is, the price of a piece of farm equipment stays high, the price of fertilizer seems to stay high. When prices come down on their commodities, the other prices--the inputs--stay high, and they find themselves in significant trouble.  The price of corn today is estimated to be about $3.15 per bushel. That is what it was in 2016, less than half of the 10-year high price of corn of $6.86 in 2012, just a few years ago. To put that in historical context, the price of corn in 2016 at $3.15 is lower than the price of corn in 1974, the year I was born, when it was $3.20. The price of corn in 2016 was 5 cents lower than it was the year I was born, 1974. It is the same story across the board for Wheat prices are down more than $1 from 2015 to 2016 alone and down more than 50 percent since 2012. I can guarantee, even though I may have sold a lot of wrong parts at the implement dealership, those wrong parts didn't come down in price 50 percent.  The livestock industry has seen similar trends, with cattle prices at their lowest level since 2010. In farming and agriculture, a lot of times we might see a year where the price of corn is high, but the price of cattle is low or the price of other commodities are high where the price of cattle is low, but when cattle are high, maybe other commodities are low. Farmers who have a diverse operation are able to offset the lows and the highs with a diverse operation--but not this year, and it looks like that may be the case next year.  Declines in States' agriculture economy are not unique to According to the U.Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, revenues have decreased for agriculture nationwide by more than 10 percent since 2014.  Recently, the Wall Street Journal wrote this, and I will show the headline of the Wall Street Journal piece just a couple of weeks ago. The Wall Street has an article entitled ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us.''  We have had a lot of debates on this floor. We have had debates about Cabinet members. We have had debates about resolutions of disapprovals. We are talking about a lot of things, but there is a lot of suffering beginning in the heartland of America right now. A lot of farmers and ranchers are suffering. They are worried about how they are going to survive, not just into the next year but how they are going to survive into the next couple of months. The telltale signs of difficult times are all around us in agriculture. This article, ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us,'' begins to tell the story. Here is what the Wall Street Journal said:       The Farm Belt is hurtling toward a milestone: Soon there      will be fewer than two million farms in America for the first      time since pioneers moved westward after the Louisiana            Across the heartland, a multiyear slump in prices for corn,      wheat and other farm commodities brought on by a glut of      grain world-wide is pushing many farmers further into debt.      Some are shutting down, raising concerns that the next few      years could bring the biggest wave of farm closures since the      1980s.  The article highlights the story of a fifth-generation farmer from Western I mentioned my hometown is 40 miles away from It looks very similar to the Eastern Plains of Colorado where I live. Here is his story:       From his father's porch, the 56-year-old can see the      windswept spot where his great-grandparents' sod house stood      in 1902 when they planted the first of the 1,200 acres on      which his family farms alfalfa, sorghum and wheat today. Even      after harvesting one of their best wheat crops ever last      year, thanks to plentiful rain and a mild winter, Mr.Scott      isn't sure how long they can afford to keep farming that      ground.  There is a lot of work we need to do to make sure Mr.Scott and farmers who live in my community around the Eastern and Western Slope of Colorado will be able to survive over the next year--steps so we can help to make sure we are addressing this crisis head-on, before it begins and develops into a full-blown farm crisis like we saw in the 1980s. We must have serious regulatory reform.  In a letter I received from the Colorado Farm Bureau, the letter read:       Colorado Farm Bureau recognizes that a major impediment to      the success of American agricultural industries and the      national economy is rampant federal regulation and the      associated cost of compliance.  We have to allow U.agriculture to flow to markets around the world, so in addition to that regulatory reform--some of which we are undertaking now through resolutions of disapproval by peeling back the overreach of government, we have to allow farmers access to more markets. That is a concern we all should share: What is going to happen with our trade policy in this country? Because if we decide to shut off trade in this country, if we decide to close access and avenues to new markets, the first people who are going to be hurt are those farmers and ranchers in Colorado and Kansas and throughout the Midwest of the United We have to have the opportunity to be able to send that bushel of wheat to Asia, that bushel of corn around the globe to make sure we are providing value-added opportunities for the world's best farmers and ranchers. Opening up new markets for Colorado and American agriculture is a clear way we can support rural economies.  Let's be clear. What I said at the beginning of these comments--there are farm communities that have diversity in their economic opportunities. A farm economy may not be 100 percent dependent on farms or ranches. Maybe they have tourism. Maybe they have some recreational opportunities. Maybe they are close to a big city where people can live there and commute. But there are a lot of towns across the United States that are solely, 100 percent committed to agriculture. They don't have access to anything but farming and ranching. When the price is down, the town is down. When the town is down, Main Street erodes. When Main Street erodes, it affects our schools and our hospitals and our relationships and our families. And somebody has to be looking out for our farmers and ranchers because the next American farm bust is upon us.  We have to take the necessary steps to pass a farm bill that gets our policies right when the new one expires. The current one expires in 2016, and these discussions are just now underway. If we have regulatory reform, if[[Page S1256]]we open up new trade opportunities for agriculture and we give farmers certainty--those are three things we can do to help address this crisis before it becomes a full-blown crisis.  We have to make sure that we support our farmers and ranchers, that we have their backs in good times and in bad times. Giving farmers certainty through a farm bill, through a regulatory landscape that provides certainty and relief, is important.  I talked to a family member of mine the other day who talks about his fear that he sees conditions similar to what we saw in the 1980s. The final relief we can provide is relief from financial regulations that are stifling the ability of banks to provide workout opportunities for farmers and ranchers when they need it.  Four things we ought to be doing for our farmers and ranchers: provide them certainty, regulatory relief, new trade opportunities, and targeted financial relief on regulations that are preventing workouts through our banks and our communities.  We have the opportunity now to prevent this country from seeing what it saw in the 1980s, but let's not be reactionary. Let's do what we can to get ahead of this before we start seeing what Secretary-designee Perdue told me the other day. One of the customers of his agricultural business took his life because he didn't know what was going to happen to his farm, and his three kids are now left wondering what they are going to do.  I hope this country understands how supportive we are of American agriculture and the actions we need to take to stand with them when times get tough.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

This February, Gary Schneiders will be leading his 12th group of students to France and Belgium for a 12-day trip ``To Experience, To Learn, To Honor, To Remember.'' This is the theme each year for his AP Euro trip. Mr.Schneiders leads the students along World War I's Western Front starting in Verdun, His students experience the battlefields and trenches of the First World They visit some of the great museums and monuments honoring the soldiers who fought in the war. Most importantly, they go to many of the cemeteries and memorials to the many soldiers who fought for the various countries in that Great At the American memorials and cemeteries like Flanders Field and the Meuse Argonne, the largest American cemetery in Europe, the students lay flags and roses at each Iowa soldier's headstone. They also lay a wreath at the memorial itself, where Taps and the National Anthem are played. Because World War I is little remembered these days, the American cemeteries see very few visitors from the United The administrators of these memorials and cemeteries are excited to see Mr.Schneiders each year with his fresh class of students.  During the latter part of the AP Euro trip, Mr.Schneiders takes his students to the beaches of He shows the students firsthand what difficulties our soldiers had in taking the beaches. On their last day in Europe, Mr.Schnieders takes his students to Omaha Beach and the Normandy American Mr.Schneiders takes his students down to Omaha Beach so they can see the distance our soldiers had to cover while carrying heavy packs and under constant fire. The students then go up to the top of the beach where the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is located. The students again put American flags and roses at each soldier from They also take the sand they brought from Omaha Beach and wipe it over the name on each headstone so the name of the soldier and the State of Iowa becomes easily visible. The students again lay a wreath and Taps and National Anthem are played throughout the cemetery.  Two weeks after returning home, Gary Schneiders and his students put on a presentation for the local veterans and community. The students set up various multimedia exhibits to share the experiences from their trip. This has become a great event each year for local veterans and the community.  To conclude, I was told that Gary Schneiders' dedication to his school, veterans, and his students has been invaluable to his community. If Gary Schneiders has anything to do with it, his students will continue ``To Experience, To Learn, To Honor, To Remember'' our veterans.

I know she is looking down on us today, and knowing my mother, she is probably saying: Kamala, what on Earth is going on down there? We have to stand up for our values.  So in the spirit of my mother, who was always direct, I cannot mince words. In the early weeks of this administration, we have seen an unprecedented series of Executive actions that have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good, hard-working people, all by Executive fiat.  By fiat, we have seen the President stick taxpayers with a bill for a multibillion-dollar border wall, without regard to the role of the U.Congress under article 1 of the By fiat, we have seen a President mandate the detention of immigrants, both documented and undocumented, creating a dragnet that could ensnare 8 million people. By fiat, the President has ordered the creation of what essentially will be a 15,000-member deportation force. By fiat, he wants to take away State and local authority by making local police officers act as Federal immigration officials. By fiat, the President wants to slam the gates of freedom by instituting a Muslim ban--a ban which was as carelessly written as it has been incompetently enforced.  In recent days, we have seen an increased severity in immigration raids sweeping across this country, including the arrest of a DREAMer in Seattle and a domestic violence victim in And we have seen an administration violate court orders, attack the First Amendment, bully Federal judges, and mock Americans exercising their right to freely assemble.  I rise today to discuss how these actions impact my State of California and our country. In particular, the State of California, I believe, is a microcosm of who we are as In California, we have farmers and environmentalists, welders and technologists, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and the largest number of immigrants, documented and undocumented, of any State in the  I rise because the President's actions have created deep uncertainty and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities. I rise on behalf of California's more than 250,000 DREAMers, who were told by the Federal Government: If you sign up, we will not use your personal information against you. I rise to say the United States of America cannot go back on our promise to these kids and their families.  I rise today as a lifelong prosecutor and as the former top cop of the biggest State in this country to say that these Executive actions present a real threat to our public safety. Let me repeat that: The President's immigration actions and Muslim ban will make America less safe.  As a prosecutor, I can tell you it is a serious mistake to conflate criminal justice policy with immigration policy, as if they are the same thing. They are not. I have personally prosecuted everything from low-level offenses to homicides. I know what a crime looks like, and I will tell you, an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. But that is what these actions do; they suggest all immigrants are criminals and treat immigrants like criminals.  There is no question, those who commit crimes must face severe and serious and swift consequence and accountability. But the truth is, the vast majority of the immigrants in this country are hard-working people who deserve a pathway to citizenship.  Instead of making us safer, these increased raids and Executive orders instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will be deported or have to give up information resulting in the deportation of their family members. For this reason, studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 9-1-1 when they have been a victim of crime. This climate of fear drives people underground and into the shadows, making them less likely to report crimes against themselves or others--fewer victims reporting crime and fewer witnesses coming forward.  These Executive actions create a strain on local law enforcement. Any police chief in this country will tell you that they barely have enough resources to get their job done. So when you make local law enforcement do the job of the Federal Government, you strain the resources for local law enforcement and that hurts everybody's safety.  Let's consider the economic harm this order will cause. Immigrants make up 10 percent of California's workforce and contribute $130 billion to our State's gross domestic product. Immigrants own small businesses, they till the land, they care for children and the elderly, they work in our labs, they attend our universities, and they serve in our military. So these actions are not only cruel, but they cause ripple effects that harm our public safety and our economy.  The same is true of this Muslim ban. This ban may as well have been hatched in the basement headquarters of We handed them a tool of recruitment to use against us. Policies that demonize entire groups of people based on the God they worship have a way of conjuring real-life demons. Policies that isolate our Muslim-American communities take away one of the greatest weapons we have in the fight against homegrown extremism.  Here is the truth. Imperfect though we may be, I believe we are a great country. I believe we are a great country. Part of what makes us great are our democratic institutions that protect our fundamental ideals: freedom of religion and the rule of law, protection from discrimination based on national origin, freedom of the press, and a 200-year history as a nation built by immigrants.  So this brings me to my message today. We have a responsibility to draw a line with these administrative actions and say no. This is not a question of party. This is about the government of coequal branches, with its inherent checks and balances. This is about the role of the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world. I know, having spent now a few weeks in this Chamber, that we have good men and women on both sides of the aisle--men and women who believe deeply in our immigrant communities and who understand that nationalism and patriotism are not the same thing.  I know that it was the junior Senator from the State of Texas who said: ``It is an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression, because you realize how fragile liberty is and how easily it can be taken away.''  It was the junior Senator from the great State of Kentucky who said: ``We must always embrace individual liberty and enforce the constitutional rights of all Americans, rich and poor, immigrants and natives, black and white.''  It was the senior Senator from the great State of Arizona who said: Undocumented immigrants should not be ``condemned forever'' to a twilight status.  So, yes, we have good people on both sides of the aisle. I say that we must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals because the critical hour is upon us.  I yield the floor.

8515,topic-id,1188,"Mr.President, I rise today, honored to speak after my colleague from New Hampshire and joining my other colleagues in opposing the nomination of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Our beautiful natural resources define my home State of New From the White Mountains to the Seacoast, to our pristine lakes and our forests, our natural resources are critical to our economy, our environment, our way of life, and protecting these resources plays a critical role, as well, in protecting public health.  However, we are already beginning to see the real impacts of climate change in New Hampshire, and these impacts threaten to have major consequences for our natural resources and families and businesses in every corner of my Recognizing that fact, members of both parties have come together in New Hampshire to enact commonsense bipartisan solutions to take on climate change and to grow and maintain our State's renewable clean energy sector. We have worked to protect our land, our air and water, and the health of our citizens.  Unfortunately, it is clear from Mr.Pruitt's opposition to the Agency he will be tasked to lead, his record of working to weaken critical environmental protections that our citizens need to thrive, and his unwillingness to fight climate change, that he is unfit to serve in this position.  The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency begins with protecting our environment and the health of all of our citizens. The EPA does critical work to protect the water we drink and the air we breathe.  In recent years, the EPA has used sound scientific evidence to take strong measures to protect our environment. Unfortunately, President Trump has made clear that he does not support this critical Throughout his campaign, the President has repeatedly attacked the EPA, calling for its elimination and saying that our environment would be ``just fine'' without it. The President has doubled down on his hostility toward this Agency by nominating Mr.Pruitt to serve as its  As attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has been a vocal critic of the very Agency he has now been nominated to lead, and he has been involved in over 20 legal actions against it.  According to the Washington Post, Mr.Pruitt has ``spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead.''  On social media, Mr.Pruitt has referred to himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' He has questioned the role of the Agency, stating that ``the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  When asked by one of my colleagues if there were any clean air or clean water EPA regulations in place today that he could support, Mr.Pruitt declined to name a single one.  The foundation of a future where all Americans have an opportunity to thrive starts with a healthy environment and healthy families. The EPA serves an important role in protecting the health of our people. We must do better than having an Administrator who has fought so tirelessly to undermine the work that this Agency does.  I am also concerned by an EPA Administrator who has consistently voiced skepticism about the clear facts on climate change. Throughout my time in office, I have always fought to protect our environment and have been a strong supporter of curbing the impacts of climate change. As a State[[Page S1247]]senator, I sponsored legislation that allowed New Hampshire to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and I helped pass the State's renewable portfolio standard to maintain and grow New Hampshire's clean renewable energy sector.  During my time as Governor, I worked with members of both parties to strengthen and build on those efforts, signing legislation to update the renewable portfolio standard and to maximize the benefits of the Regional Greenhouse Gas  I am proud that my State has long led efforts to cut carbon emissions, and it is crucial that other States follow our lead and take responsibility for the pollution that they cause. That is exactly why I am a strong supporter of measures like the Clean Power  I also strongly support the Paris agreement on climate change and believe that the United States must take action to implement the agreement while also ensuring that our international partners fulfill their obligations.  Mr.Pruitt, however, has been a consistent skeptic on the role of climate change and the role that it has had on our environment.  Mr.Pruitt has stated that we do not know the extent of human impact on climate change and has called climate change a natural occurrence. He has said that climate change is ``one of the major policy debates of our time.''  And he continued:       That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to      disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and      its connection to the actions of mankind.  Scientists are clear in their understanding of the climate change science. The American Association for the Advancement of Science says the scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.  The American Geophysical Union says that humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years.  The American Meteorological Society says it is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half a century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and human influence on the climate system is clear.  The EPA is a science-based organization, and it is unacceptable for the EPA Administrator to be at odds with the well-established views of leading scientists. As the Agency's own website says:       EPA is one of the world's leading environmental and human      health research organizations. Science provides the      foundation for Agency policies, actions, and decisions made      on behalf of the American people. Our research incorporates      science and engineering that meet the highest standards      for integrity, peer review, transparency, and ethics.  Mr.Pruitt disagrees with well-established climate science. Simply put, that disqualifies him from leading an agency where ``science provides the foundation for . . . policies, actions, and decisions.'' If you refuse to believe research from the world's leading scientists, you cannot lead a science-based agency.  From protecting our environment to protecting public health, the EPA plays a critical role in protecting the health of Granite Staters and all We know that a cleaner environment plays a key role in the economy, for the economy of New Hampshire and our entire country. We should be building on the critical efforts the EPA has taken to combat climate change and protect public health, not rolling them back.  Mr.Pruitt's hostility to the basic functions of the Environmental Protection Agency and his work to undermine protections for clean air, land, and water make clear that he should not serve in this role.  I will vote against Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

8603,topic-id,271,"Mr.President, as cochairs of the Rare Disease Caucus, Senator Klobuchar and I have worked hard to bring more hope to patients and their families who are coping with rare diseases on a daily basis.  Today 1 in 20 individuals worldwide is living with one or more of the more than 7,000 rare diseases, 95 percent of which do not have an effective treatment. While the incentives provided by the Orphan Drug Act, first championed by me in 1983, has led to the approval of nearly 600 orphan drugs, much more needs to be done.  Many patients living with rare diseases rely on the FDA to evaluate and approve treatment options for their conditions. That is why it is so important for the FDA to use its authority to accelerate the evaluation and approval of drugs for treating rare diseases and for Congress to ensure that proper incentives exist for research to discover and make affordable treatments and cures available for this community.  To address this issue, Congress passed the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, which refined and strengthened the tools available to FDA to accelerate the evaluation and approval of new drugs targeting unmet medical needs for rare conditions. I have been paying close attention to how this new authority translates into advances for patients suffering from conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, Bertrand-N-glycanase deficiency, and other rare diseases.  In light of these changes over the past few years, I ask my friend from Minnesota whether the current approval process is achieving its goals of safety and efficacy without hampering the development of new therapies.

I have also contacted the FDA frequently during the past year to encourage the agency to listen to the voices of patients during the agency's evaluation process.  When the Senate considers the nominee for FDA Commissioner, I will continue to stress the importance of incorporating a balanced and flexible approach when weighing risks, benefits, and outcomes, especially when dealing with small patient populations with such rapidly progressing prognoses.  Patients with limited or no treatment options are depending on FDA to utilize the flexibility outlined in This law, which provides full and fair review of new drug therapies in a timely manner, gives hope to patients suffering from life threatening diseases and, of course, their families as well.

8506,topic-id,1496,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues today to recognize that the environment is critically important. One of the true issues States face is getting back to the promises of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act to make sure States enjoy primacy, and I think that is a critical component that is not being discussed today as we look at guaranteed clean water and clean air--making sure that those closest to those issues have the ability to have the input that was anticipated by almost every environmental statute. So I would remind my colleagues that when we focus many times on Federal issues and Federal appointments, one of the most important things that we can do is focus on the fact that these Federal agency heads need to work cooperatively with State organizations.  Scott Pruitt, who is a soon-to-be former attorney general, understands the State role, and I think that is a critical qualification and an important distinction to make.                               Ex-IM Bank  But I didn't come to talk about the appointment of Scott I came to talk about something we could all agree on, and in fact the President and I agree on this, and I think everyone agrees on this almost unanimously, which is that American jobs matter. Putting Americans back to work in manufacturing is one of the most critical things that we can do in the Senate, making sure that our people have an opportunity to succeed, participate, and have an opportunity to produce goods and services that can be exported and can grow the wealth of our country and grow the economy of our country.  Last week I joined President Trump in a small bipartisan lunch. We had a chance to talk about a variety of issues. There are very many issues that divide us, but this issue unites us. I specifically talked with the President about the need to get the Export-Import Bank up and running. I also talked to him about the Export-Import Bank in December and talked about the importance of enabling this institution to function for the American manufacturing worker. The great news is that President Trump agrees, and he informed me that we can in fact say he supports the Ex-Im Bank and that he would be nominating someone soon to serve on the Export-Import  That led off a rash of discussion among the usual naysayers with the Ex-Im Bank, mostly driven by ideology and not fact. So I think it is important to come once again to reiterate the importance of the Ex-Im  I certainly appreciate the President's interest in making American workers a priority. He will be at Boeing in South Carolina on I don't know if he will make any announcement about nominating someone to the Ex-Im I hope he does.  There has been a lot of talk about supporting the economy and boosting American manufacturing jobs, but all that talk falls on deaf ears if we don't take action on the simple issues when we can accomplish those goals, and that simple issue is enabling the Export-Import Bank to function. For decades the Export-Import Bank has leveled the playing field for American workers and businesses. Yet heavy politics is enabling one Senator to put political ideology before the jobs and well-being of thousands of American workers across our country.  We worked very, very hard in 2015. We knew that we were going to be challenged to get the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized. In June of 2015, the Export-Import Bank expired and did not have a charter. It was not authorized for the first time in its more than 80-year history. I fought very hard to reauthorize it, as did a number of my colleagues. Finally, in December 2016, 6 months later, the Bank was given a charter, given an authorization. I want to point out something because I think way too often we think what stops this endeavor is partisan politics. Guess what. Over 70 percent of the House of Representatives voted for the Ex-Im Bank and over 60 percent of the Senate voted for the Ex-Im This is not a partisan issue. There is bipartisan support. Yet there is a narrow group of people who would rather put ideology ahead of American jobs. It is wrong on so many levels.  Despite the fact, unfortunately, that we finally authorized the Ex-Im Bank over a year ago with overwhelming support, we do not have a Bank that can authorize any credits over $10 million. That is because it requires a quorum of Bank board members to make that decision. We only have two out of the five members of the board. That means that we don't have a quorum. So what has been happening is that there is $30 billion--think about that, $30 billion--of American exports waiting in the queue, waiting for approval, hoping desperately to get the[[Page S1243]]Ex-Im Bank up and running so those exports can receive the credit they need and receive the guarantees that those exports need and get people back to work.  Do you know what else has been happening since we haven't had a quorum on the Bank? Thousands of American jobs have been transported to places like France and We are losing thousands of jobs.  When I hear people say the Ex-Im Bank is the bank of Boeing or the bank of GE, trust me, I do not bleed for the executives of I do not bleed for the executives of They will do fine. In fact, they know how to get around this problem. They just move those manufacturing jobs to a country that will recognize the exports and will provide that export credit. That is what is happening. But guess what is happening to the American worker and families across these manufacturing facilities? They are getting pink slips. Why? Because this body refuses to give us a quorum on the Ex-Im  The President understands this. The President understands how important it is to get these American workers back together. Now I want you just to think about what $30 billion of exports is worth to American employment. If we use the numbers that extrapolate, it is hard to know, but it is over 170,000 jobs. Think about the fact that 170,000 jobs are waiting in the wings for us to do the right thing. When we move forward with the Ex-Im Bank, I think we will have a good day--a good bipartisan day when the President of the United States joins with those of us who care about workers and manufacturing in this country--and we will get the Ex-Im Bank up and running. I think if we fail to do it and if we fail to send the signals that help is coming and that the Ex-Im Bank is going to be an effective institution that will once again play a role in American manufacturing and will be in that tool chest of trade opportunities--if we don't do it--then they are going to give up all hope, and they are going to find some other place to manufacture the products that will allow them to access the credit, that will allow them to sell their products overseas. So it is critically important.  I want to leave with one statistic. The Peterson Institute recently estimated that the United States is losing $50 million in exports for every day that a nomination is not confirmed--$50 million of new wealth creation for our country. It is a travesty.  Of all of the things I have seen here--the callous things--that sound so bureaucratic when you talk about the Ex-Im Bank, when you pick up the curtain and you look underneath, what we see are American jobs and American families and American opportunity and new wealth creation for our country and economic growth for our country. And because some institution that could give you a black mark in a political campaign says ``We don't like it,'' it doesn't get done. Shame on us.  Thank you to the President for agreeing to help us move the Ex-Im Bank forward. Thank you to all of my colleagues--64 in the last Congress--who stood with us to get the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized and the over 70 percent of the House of Representatives, on a stand-alone vote, who voted for the Ex-Im Bank, who know how critically important this is. We can get this job done, and we can stop the migration of these jobs to other countries.  I look forward to hearing more this week and hopefully early next week from the As a member of the Banking Committee, I look forward to pushing for a hearing and a vote on this nominee. And I look forward to the day that all of these exporters and these American workers can see that this institution can work for them, and that will be the day that those credits are approved at the Ex-Im  Thank you so much, Mr. I yield the floor.

8419,topic-id,675,"Mr.Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. I meet with these folks all the time when I am back home in the Second District, as I know my colleagues do when they are back in their districts, and we see firsthand the benefits that these people's dreams, their innovations, their hard work, and as they provide to our communities that inspiration.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical to our country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of all of the net new jobs. Let me repeat that. Small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of all the net new jobs over the past two decades. This isn't just a one-time blip. This is over the last two decades.  So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage success and growth for our small businesses, our startups, and our entrepreneurs. It is this notion that I think brings us to this legislation we are discussing here today.  H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in those businesses.  Currently, the SEC rule 701 permits private companies to offer their own securities as part of written compensation agreements with employees, directors, general partners, trustees, officers, or other certain consultants without having to comply with rigid Federal securities registration requirements. The SEC rule 701, therefore, allows small companies to reward their employees.  Despite the SEC having the authority to increase the $5 million threshold via a rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize what, I would argue, are highly politicized regulatory undertakings instead of focusing on its core mission, which includes the facilitation of capital formation. That is one of the key core jobs of the Securities and Exchange Well, if the SEC isn't going to focus its priorities, then Congress will help them do that. So that is why we are here today on this bill.  I believe it is imperative that small businesses not only in West Michigan, but across America, have the ability to compete. A critical element of competition and success is, first, that small businesses be able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent in their fields. In today's world, that includes rewarding employees with stock options. To me, this is common sense. Small-business employees have a clear and vested interest in the success of their employers, and oftentimes they are attracted to it.  I know, having some younger children myself that are coming into adulthood, they are looking for that excitement. They are looking for that opportunity. They are looking to be builders themselves.  Well, by increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will give these private companies more flexibility to attract, reward, and retain those employees. This simple change would allow companies to offer twice as much stock to their employees annually without having to trigger additional disclosure information to investors about those compensation packages that include securities offerings.  By reforming this regulatory burden, Mr.Speaker, startups, small businesses, and emerging growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly talented individuals from companies that are better capitalized and able to provide cash compensation. By incentivizing employees with stock options, small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field in order to retain those valuable employees rather than seeing them flee to cash, frankly.  This bill is an example, I believe, of positive, bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle. I commend our sponsors of the bills, Representative Hultgren, who spoke a little earlier; Representatives Delaney, Higgins, MacArthur, Sinema, and Stivers, for their leadership on this issue; and my friend from Colorado, as well, and what he is doing.  I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2641-4.txt,2028,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,4.0,January
8416,topic-id,370,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friends, colleagues from Colorado for their work on this, for their support of this important legislation.  I rise today to speak in support of the rule providing for consideration of H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017. I am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation, and I am grateful for the consideration it has been given by the House, and I am encouraged by its strong record of bipartisan support. The bill has passed the House in prior Congresses as part of larger capital markets packages, but this is the first time the legislation will be considered on its own.  We have had very constructive debate on the bill in the Financial Services Committee over the last few years. This debate has allowed us to build a strong consensus around this uniting principle: What is good for the company should also be good for the employee, and vice versa.  We want it to be easy for companies to offer stock compensation to their employees. This is a company issue, and this is a jobs issue, but this is also a workforce issue. The title of this legislation does not betray its intent. We believe encouraging employee ownership is important.  Agreement on the benefits of employee ownership has contributed to the strong bipartisan support enjoyed by this legislation. It has three Republican and three Democratic original cosponsors. Furthermore, the majority of Republicans and Democrats voted in favor of the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act when it was considered in the House Financial Services Committee just last month. We are simply expanding on something that is working.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, the investor protection regulator, has never raised issue with reduced disclosures available under rule 701, so we are simply saying this tool[[Page H2644]]should be made available to more companies and to their employees. We do this by adjusting for inflation the threshold for the amount of securities that can be issued each year under rule 701.

8532,topic-id,1586,"Mr.President, let me say that that was an excellent presentation by Senator I can recall when she first came here, and I sat down with her and we talked about her predecessor and about how people with diverse philosophies can get along and actually love each other.  I would expect the same thing to happen in this case--because it does. I listened to some of the things that were said by the new Senator from California, talking about the rule of law, about freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the First I agree. I am hoping that we end up with more things in common than things that would keep us apart because we have a lot to do. We need to get busy doing it. I appreciate very much hearing the opening speech by Senator  Mr.President, I wanted to get to the floor because it won't be long until we will be voting on my Oklahoma attorney general, Scott I am looking forward to it. He and I go back a long way. I know that he has been through the ringer, as a lot of them have. I look[[Page S1259]]at Jeff Sessions and some of the abusive things that were said about him during the time that he was going through this process. Of course, the same thing has been true with Scott  Scott Pruitt just happens to be not only a candidate who is going to make an excellent Administrator of the EPA, but he is also one who knows the job. He has been there. He has been attorney general for Oklahoma, my He lives in my home town of Tulsa, So I know him quite well. In fact, I am in aviation, and I remember flying him around the State in some areas, introducing him when he was just starting out in the statewide race.  I think he is going to do a really good job. It is my understanding that my colleagues on the other side are determined to run the clock before we vote on Attorney General Pruitt, and they are using the opportunity to make the case that he will destroy the environment and return pollution to the air and water.  Yet they know that he will do nothing of the sort. Attorney General Pruitt is highly qualified. Yes, it is true that he has had the occasion to file lawsuits on behalf of the State of Oklahoma against the Environmental Protection I can assure you that he knows that he has represented the State of There are many other States that were doing the same thing.  He is a believer in the rule of law and will uphold the laws as passed by Congress within constitutional bounds. He has built a career defending the law, and I see no cause for concern that he will ever stop. He has been practicing law in Oklahoma since 1993, when he graduated from law school at the University of In 1998, he ran and was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate, where he served for 6 years. During that time in the Oklahoma State Senate, he was seen as a leader, someone who could be counted upon, and someone who should be in higher office in the  Of course, that is what happened. Since 2010, he has been the Attorney General for He became a respected defender of the State's role in our Federal system of government. As EPA Administrator, Pruitt will continue to uphold core constitutional principles and won't be engaged in the same Federal overreach that we have seen over the last 8 years.  I know there are varying philosophies in this body. I know there are people who want to concentrate the power in They see nothing wrong with what we refer to as governmental overreach. I have experienced this because it happens that I was the chairman, as well as the ranking member, of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has the jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection So I have watched this take place.  I know that there are members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who have differing philosophies as to what the EPA should be doing. They see outsiders. They see the State, sometimes, as someone who is opposed to the things they are trying to do. But we have watched this happen over the last 8 years.  Attorney General Pruitt has said again and again that he will uphold the laws that we pass right here in Congress--no more and no less. So it is up to us as lawmakers to provide him with effective bipartisan legislation that will make a positive difference for the environment and for our future, while balancing State and private interests. This balance is possible and Scott Pruitt is a testament to this balance.  Oklahoma is an energy Oklahoma is an agricultural We care a great deal about the land we live on and the air we breathe, and we want to be sure it is safe for our families and for generations to come. I think about the Administrator that was there during the years of the Obama administration, and he was actually in a hearing just a few hours ago. He talked about how comforting it was to come to our State of Oklahoma--which he did twice. He learned that landowners are on the side of the environment. They are the ones who want to care for the land. They are the ones who want to exert whatever energies are necessary to take care of the problems with pollution that are present in this world.  As attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has worked closely with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality and the Oklahoma Water Resources Board to protect Oklahoma's scenic rivers from upstream pollution. As a matter of fact, as to his reputation, he is ``Mr.Scenic Rivers'' back in I don't understand how people concerned with the environment are opposing him and saying things about him that are detrimental.  He was able to use unbiased logic and science to reach an agreement with the State of Arkansas to protect our water in He has also been instrumental in negotiating a historic water settlement agreement. This agreement was between the State of Oklahoma, the Choctaw Nation, and the Chickasaw  This thing, I say to the Presiding Officer, has been in litigation for 100 years. He walked in, and he resolved the problem. It was a battle that had gone on for 100 years. One of the chief concerns of the Chickasaw and the Choctaw Nations was to ensure that conservation guidelines were preserved. The agreement not only provides Oklahoma City with its long-term water needs but also protects our two Indian nations with their conservation goals. Again, this was tried by a lot of people over a period of 100 years until Scott Pruitt came along. He is the one who did it.  He has sued the EPA and fought against the Fish and Wildlife Service at times. It has all been in Oklahoma's best interest. Now he will have the entire Nation's best interest in mind when making decisions as the EPA I have no doubt that he will continue to protect our State's interests from overreach and unnecessary harmful regulations.  It is no secret that Attorney General Pruitt's confirmation process has been unusually lengthy. It is time we vote to confirm him in this position. We had his nomination hearing in the Environment and Public Works That was back on January 18, almost a month ago. That hearing was one to be remembered because we broke a record by asking 4 rounds of questions. I suggest that no one in this confirmation process this year or in the last three generations has had to undergo four rounds of questions.  During the course of this day-long, 8-hour hearing, he answered more than 200 questions. Now, after this, he responded to more than 1,000 questions for the record, including the extra questions Senator Carper asked him in a December 28 letter, as Attorney General Pruitt promised he would.  Now, this means that he answered--these are questions for the record--1,600 questions. The average director, during confirmation over the last 3 Presidential years, had 200. So it is 200 questions, as opposed to 1,600 questions that he was subjected to. He never complained about it and actually did a great job.  Now, despite the Democrats' efforts to delay his confirmation vote, we need to be responsible and move forward to confirm Attorney General The longer we postpone this vote, the longer it is going to take for things to get done at the Right now nothing can get done. Everyone knows that. That is wrong. I know that Attorney General Pruitt will continue to be a champion for economic development and environmental responsibility by upholding the law and restoring the Environmental Protection Agency to its role as a regulatory agency, not an activist organization.  You know, this is all for show because everybody knows the votes are there. He is going to be approved. I look forward to working with him. I think he is ready now to move in and do the job. It is going to be a while before he is able to get the other positions confirmed. That is why it is important to go ahead and do it, and I understand we are going to be doing it when this time runs out.  I yield the floor.

The rules governing      quorums for reporting legislative matters shall govern rules      changes, modification, amendments, or suspension.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS436.txt,1608,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1343, ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE",2017.0,24.0,February
8495,topic-id,2102,"Mr.President, I also rise to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA  To summarize--and then I will go into some detail--Virginians are pro-science people. The political figure we most venerate is still Thomas Jefferson, who was the preeminent scientist of his day. We are pro-science people. Second, the evidence from Mr.Pruitt's career demonstrates he is anti-science in the climate area and possibly others. Third, there is no position in the Federal Government that more relies upon accurate science and scientistic judgement than EPA  I think the President is afforded significant discretion in appointing members of the Cabinet, and I have voted to confirm a number of President Trump's nominees even if I wouldn't have nominated them myself because I think they meet the basic test of competence and integrity. But I have voted against individuals if they can't satisfy me that they meet our ethical standards or that they are qualified for the position or that they are able to do the job fairly and objectively.  The ability of the EPA Administrator to do this job fairly and objectively requires an acknowledgement of the scientific reality of climate change and other science. This isn't an abstract matter for Virginia, and it is not an abstract matter for the EPA  Next only to coastal Louisiana, Virginia is the most susceptible State to sea level rise. Hampton Roads, VA, with 1.6 million people--our second largest metropolitan area--not only is it a busy and thriving metropolitan area, but it is the center of American naval power and the largest base of naval operations in the world. It is the homeport for the U.Atlantic fleet. What we are seeing throughout Hampton Roads, VA, is that neighborhoods where you could sell and buy a house 15 years ago, you now can't because normal tidal action renders the homes impossible to sell. It affects businesses.  By 2040, the main road into the largest naval base in the world, Norfolk, will be covered 2 to 3 hours a day just by normal tidal action, not by storm surges, which make it more significant. So now the cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Chesapeake, Newport News, and Hampton are all trying to figure out ways to make resiliency investments to protect against sea level rise, and the Department of Defense is having to contemplate the same kinds of investments to protect our naval operations in Hampton  The EPA's mission and its entire existence revolve around science. To enforce the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, to set limits on pollutants that are stringent enough to have measurable benefits but reasonable enough to avoid negative economic impacts to the degree we can, and to pore over reams and reams of data and analysis and figure out whether a chemical in a consumer product is harmful takes science. To analyze whether fracking or some other method of extracting energy is dangerous to drinking water or not dangerous or somewhere in the middle or what the right limits should be takes science.  In an earlier iteration, I was the mayor of My city has a river in the middle of it that was so polluted--the James River--you couldn't swim in it and you couldn't fish in it. There was no bird life in it because it had been polluted over such a long time. Today, go to Richmond, VA, and you will see people canoeing[[Page S1237]]and kayaking. You will see people fishing and taking the fish home to eat. You will see people swimming. It has gone from the sewer of our city to the front yard of our city, to the thing that has helped bring population back into downtown Richmond and grow our population, and it happened because of the Clean Water  There is always a question in regulation--too hot, too cold, or just right. But my city would not be what it is today had there not been a Clean Water Act that required us--in some ways that were painful at times--to save the river, and now it has herons, bald eagles, fish, kayakers, and canoeists, and everybody's quality of life and the economy are better too.  Mr.Pruitt has been asked repeatedly about his views on climate science. Just 4 months ago, he stated:       We've done a lot [in reducing carbon emissions], and that's      not even addressing, guys, the fact that there's a tremendous      dispute, as you know, that's going on in the marketplace      about how much this global warming trend that the [Obama]      administration talks about, if it's true or not.       Is it truly man-made and is this simply just another period      of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? I      mean is it just typical natural type of occurrences as      opposed to what the Administration says?  That was just 4 months ago. This kind of skepticism--we don't know whether humans cause it; we don't know whether it is natural--is exactly the kind of thing we have seen in Congress before. There was a famous hearing in Congress that was sort of emblazoned on people's memories of a whole bunch of witnesses standing up and swearing to tell the truth and saying: We don't know that there is a connection between cigarette smoking and cancer. This kind of denial of the scientific consensus from an Administrator of the chief agency that needs science in this country is deeply troubling.  I don't think it should be going out on a limb to declare that climate change is happening, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels, and is a problem we have to deal with in some way. How to deal with it, how quickly to deal with it--those are tough questions, but acknowledging the science should not be tough.  That acknowledgement of the science was the policy of a predecessor of mine, Virginia Senator John Warner, a Republican, who introduced one of the first climate bills in Congress with Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman in 2006. This policy that we recognize science was the policy of the George H.Bush administration, which negotiated the U.Framework Convention on Climate Change more than 25 years ago. It was the policy that underlay the Presidential campaign of one of our colleagues, Senator John McCain, in 2008.  Acknowledging the science of climate change isn't a matter of political views; it is a matter of science and reality. We can discuss and debate what to do about it, and I think those are challenging discussions to have. That is fair game. Differences of opinion about what to do about--that is fair game. But denying an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change exists and that it is driven by human activity in the burning of fossil fuels--something ExxonMobil scientists were agreeing to in papers written in the 1980s, not 4 months ago--denying that is a denial of science.  I worry. If Mr.Pruitt denies science on this matter, what other science will he deny? His record as attorney general in Oklahoma bears me out on my worry to some degree. In virtually every decision, the attorney general's office defended the interests of oil and gas, of Big Agribusiness, and basically the interests of polluters against the interests of clean air and water, which are the interests of our families and our kids.  A New York Times article from 2 years ago--before Mr.Pruitt was nominated for this position--identified that when the EPA was looking at the potential impacts--potential, not guaranteed; we are trying to determine if there are impacts--of fracking on water quality and seismic instability, Attorney General Pruitt submitted comments on behalf of the State of Oklahoma that expressed skepticism that fracking was causing any problems. Well, why not do the investigation? Why not get to the bottom of it? Was the opinion that he expressed backed by science? Was it backed by a deep analysis that had been done by scientists or smart attorneys in Mr.Pruitt's office? In this instance, good investigative journalism determined that the comment expressing skepticism about fracking having any effect on water quality was actually written by an energy company, copied, and pasted onto official Oklahoma letterhead and submitted to the EPA as representing the views of Oklahoma public officials.  Would it be appropriate for the attorney general of Oklahoma--a State that has significant oil and gas--to take into account the views of oil and gas producers on something as important as fracking? In fact, you would not be doing your job if you didn't take the views of those companies into account. But considering industry views is very different from taking their views and portraying them as coming from you, a holder of a public trust who is supposed to be working for everybody and not just one company or one industry.  Here is one more example I will give before I conclude, because I take it personally. Virginia is one of the six States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. I worked on this matter as Governor of Virginia, along with colleagues in the other States and the District of Columbia, and we worked together with the EPA on how to clean up the bay. This is a treasured resource for It is about as bipartisan a thing as there is in Probably next to support for veterans, support for the Chesapeake Bay would be a close second in bipartisanship. As public officials, we worked out with the EPA a strategy we thought would be conducive to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay--which is not just about enjoyment, not just about water quality, but also about traditional Virginia industries, like watermen's industry tourism, which is a big industry in our  We worked it out to our satisfaction, but when we did, there was a lawsuit filed against this particular regulation by the Farm The attorney general of Oklahoma--not one of the six States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed--the attorney general of Oklahoma intervened and filed a friend-of-the-court brief to try to strike down the regulation that the EPA and Virginia officials had worked on in tandem for the good of the Chesapeake Bay, for the good of our Commonwealth, for the good of our citizens.  I contend: Why would an attorney general in Oklahoma care so much about a Chesapeake Bay rule that we had worked out together? I contend that he and some other attorneys general who joined in this were worried that if the EPA succeeded, then the EPA might try something in other large watersheds, including those in their  The matter did go to the Federal appellate court. The Federal appellate court upheld the Chesapeake Bay plan. The attorneys general and others tried to take it to the Supreme The Supreme Court wouldn't take the appeal, and so the Chesapeake Bay plan is in operation. We were all struck about why an Oklahoma attorney general would be going after something affecting the Commonwealth of Virginia, and there is a point there.  The point was this. EPA scientists working in tandem with State officials had analyzed the water quality in the bay, and they had followed the State's progress, or lack thereof, over time, and they finally said, again, working in tandem with many of us: The pollution levels are so bad that we are never going to return the bay to what it can be unless we need to take action.  It was that scientific consensus that Mr.Pruitt as attorney general of Oklahoma was challenging. Science is the pursuit of truth. Science is supposed to follow where the facts lead, no matter what the scientist's initial views might be.  Mr.Pruitt's record does not tell me he will follow the data wherever it leads. It tells me that whenever there is a menu of options, he is going to take the option that is most beneficial to polluters rather than beneficial to public health.  I will conclude with the point at which I started. There is no Federal agency that needs to have somebody who accepts science and scientific consensus more than the It matters[[Page S1238]]deeply to Virginia, but I don't think Virginians are unique to this. I think it matters to the citizens of 50  EPA regulations are not all wise, and some need to be dialed back. I have seen the positive effects of wise EPA regulations in my city and in my I am going to vote no on Mr.Pruitt because I don't believe his first duty will be to follow science and enforce just laws and regulations, appropriately governing the water we drink and the air we breathe.

8539,topic-id,3463,"Mr.President, I want to first thank Senator Carper for his leadership today, and I rise today[[Page S1264]]to join him in speaking about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection  I will not be voting in favor of Mr.Pruitt's nomination for EPA Administrator because of his record and views on issues that are very important to the people of my State--issues like climate change, which matters in Minnesota, and issues like the Renewable Fuel I am not sure everyone has focused on that today, but I think it is important, especially for States in the Midwest, to focus on what his record has been on this issue.  Mr.Pruitt has written that the climate change debate is ``far from settled'' and has made other troubling comments about climate change. I could not disagree more. I believe that the debate on whether climate change is happening is over. The facts are in, and the science is clear.  The ``2014 National Climate Assessment'' stated the most recent decade was the Nation's warmest on record. U.temperatures are expected to continue to rise. It was drafted by over 300 authors and extensively reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences and a Federal advisory committee of 60 members.  The ``Quadrennial Defense Review 2014'' of the Department of Defense of the United States stated: ``The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.''  Climate change isn't just about melting glaciers and rising ocean levels, although it is certainly about that. It is also about what we have experienced in the When I first got to the Senate, I remember hearing from experts, including people in our own Defense Department and major military leaders who talked about the fact that one of the consequences of climate change will be, first of all, all over the world in economies that are already struggling. We are going to see some of those developing nations encounter unpredictable weather--hurricanes, tsunamis.  In the Midwest, while we may not have tsunamis, what we see is major, unpredictable weather, which is just as dangerous. We have seen the devastating impacts of natural disasters like Hurricane Matthew, and we have seen flooding from Cedar Rapids and  We now know the risk of climate change to Minnesota, to our country, and to our planet. We must reduce greenhouse gas and tackle the challenge of global climate change head-on. If we don't tackle this issue, we are going to continue to struggle with the far-reaching economic and environmental consequences.  Shifting global trends have the potential to wreak more long-term havoc on our businesses and our industries. That is why businesses in my State--major companies like Cargill and General Mills--have been willing to take this on, have been willing to talk about this as a problem. They see this as a moral obligation to their employees and their customers, but they also see it as part of their business. They can't simply continue in business and serve people all over the world if major economies could be ruined by one storm or if we see areas flooded that are on our coast or the kind of weather we have seen in the It is bad for business, and they are willing to admit that.  As a Senator from Minnesota with a strong ag industry and also a tradition of hunting and fishing, I see climate change as a direct threat to my State's economy for recreation. It is also a threat to our State's heritage of enjoying the outdoors, whether that is snowmobiling or whether that is our wildlife. We have seen some major changes to the wildlife in our  I have always believed that an ``all of the above'' plan is necessary to build a new energy agenda for America, but it must be an agenda that recognizes the challenges of climate change. Someone who heads up the EPA must believe in science. It is an Agency grounded in science.  Mr.Pruitt has also been quoted as saying ``the ethanol fuel mandate is unworkable.'' I know he has changed some of his views since he was nominated, but I, as a Senator from a State that relies on renewable fuels as one of our major industries in the ag part of our State, must look at his entire record and what he has actually said when he has been in positions of power.  How do I see the Renewable Fuel Standard? The Renewable Fuel Standard has led to important advancements in clean energy, and the standard has provided stability and predictability that have and will continue to drive long-term investments in the renewable space.  Every time a new study is released on the subject, I become even more convinced that investments in renewable fuels are investments in the future health of our economy and our environment. A recent study by ABF Economics showed that the ethanol industry generated $7.37 billion in gross sales in 2015 for Minnesota businesses and $1.6 billion in income for Minnesota households. Here is a big one: The ethanol industry also supports over 18,000 full-time jobs in  Senators on both sides of the aisle understand that renewable fuels are important as a home-grown economic generator. They also are about 10 percent of our fuel supply in the United That is a competitor for oil. When we have that kind of competition, that allows us to have everything from electric cars to other kinds of renewables, and we should not simply rely on the oil industry to fuel our vehicles. Renewable fuels are an important competitor.  As I mentioned, there is strong bipartisan support for renewable fuels. I have worked closely with many friends across the aisle for many years on this issue. And, of course, the further ethanol and renewable fuels take us, the less dependent we will be on foreign oil. We need and want a mixed fuel supply.  Now is not the time to waiver on support for renewable fuels. The EPA Administrator has many flexibilities under the law to slow or make changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard, and that is why I am concerned about the past record of this nominee on this important issue.  Another reason we need consistent and effective leadership at the EPA is in the fight to maintain and restore the Great Our Great Lakes contain 90 percent of our Nation's supply of fresh surface water and supply drinking water to 30 million And our economy? The Great Lakes' combined economic impact is so enormous that restoration alone is estimated to provide $50 billion in long-term economic benefits. That is why last year's Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act reauthorized the Great Lakes Restoration These projects have helped eliminate toxins from our waters, combat invasive species--something very critical in my State with invasive carp--protect against pollution, restore habitats for fish and wildlife, and promote the overall health.  The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for leading efforts to implement, administer, and distribute grant funding across agencies that undertake restoration activities. As I noted, Minnesota is home to a thriving outdoor economy that relies on clean water, free of invasive species. It is vital that our next EPA Administrator continue to take action to stop the spread of invasive carp before they reach the Great Lakes and many of our most important northern waters.  My background? My grandpa was an iron ore miner. He worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines most of his life. Every day when he went down in that cage, he would always think about what he would like to do in the outdoors. He loved to hunt. About once a year, they would borrow a car from my uncle. They would go to see Lake Superior, and he would bring his sons to see Lake  I want an EPA Administrator that sees that, yes, you want a strong economy, and yes, those things can work together with the environment, but you also need to preserve that outdoors and wildlife and those Great Lakes my grandpa and my family hold so dear.  Mr.Pruitt has articulated extreme views about the role of the EPA, but there is a bigger problem here. We still don't know his full views and record. My colleagues who sat on the Environment and Public Works Committee have asked Mr.Pruitt to produce critical documents that will clarify his record and vision for the EPA, and 19 times, Mr.Pruitt told Senators they should get the information from his attorney general's office. Well, they tried[[Page S1265]]and they have not succeeded. The Oklahoma attorney general's office told them that they have a 2-year backlog for such requests. In committee questions for the record, my colleagues asked Mr.Pruitt to clear the backlog and provide the committee with these communications. Once again, he declined. Mr.Pruitt has not provided the Senate with the information we need to make an informed decision about his nomination.  The EPA Administrator will be entrusted with protecting the health and well-being of This is a tremendous responsibility. That is why Americans deserve a clear picture of Mr.Pruitt's record on protecting public health, clean air, and clean water, including a review of the emails that were ordered to be released today.                                 Russia  Now, Mr.President, I would like to turn to another topic. Actually, after watching parts of the President's lengthy and unpredictable news conference today, I came upon some of the parts dealing with I thought it was important that I come down to the floor and address them.  The part of the press conference that I saw was where the President referred to the reporting that has been done on Russia as fake news. The reporting that has been done about all of the contacts between members of his campaign and the Russian intelligence agencies--I assume he includes the reporting that has been done on the phone call that was made to the Russian Ambassador--and the various other reporting that we have seen--that is very troubling about this administration's dealing with Russia from the campaign time, to the transition, to the present.  I would just like to say that this is far from fake news; this is fact. And if you don't believe it is fact, then that means you don't believe 17 U.intelligence agencies and that instead you take the word of Russians, Russian intelligence and Putin's word. I go with our 17 U.intelligence agencies that have made it very clear that Russia had been attempting to influence our election.  This was borne out to me when Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and I visited the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia at the end of last year in What we saw there and what we heard there makes us know that this is not just one single incident of Russia trying to influence one candidate's campaign or even one election or even one country's election, but that this is a modus operandi, that they have done this before. They did it in Estonia when they were mad that they moved a statue. What did they do? They shut down their internet. They did it in Lithuania when the Lithuanians had the audacity to invite members of the Ukrainian Parliament who were in exile because they were part of the legally annexed Lithuania invites them to their 25th anniversary celebration of their independence from What happens? Russia attacks the accounts of members of the Lithuanian  I have already expressed deep concern about this administration's lack of transparency on a variety of critical issues, but nowhere is this more true than when it comes to this administration's interactions with the Russian For months, U.intelligence agencies have said that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda--$200 million worth--to try to undermine our democracy. Reports show it and the facts prove it.  Unlike what the President said today at the press conference, this is not fake news. Last week, in fact, we learned that the very day President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for their unprecedented attacks on our democracy, a member of the Trump transition team spoke to a senior Russian official regarding those sanctions and then did not tell the truth about it. The National Security Advisor--the person charged with the most sensitive matters of U.national security--misled the Vice President and, in turn, the American people. We have now seen two people resign: the campaign manager for Trump's campaign and the National Security And one of the things they have in common is Russia and a relationship with  So, no, this is not what the President said at his press conference today or earlier in a tweet. This is not about some kind of sour grapes--those were not his words but his implication about the loss of Hillary That is not what this is. This is not about her loss in the last campaign. These are facts that have emerged since that time that I think are important to everyone.  I appreciated the words a few months ago from Senator Rubio, who said that this is not about one campaign, this is not about one election, because it could quickly turn on the other party. We have an obligation as Senators to protect our democracy. That is what this is about--to make sure we have fair and free elections that are not influenced by foreign governments.  Today, Secretary Mattis said that Russia's behavior is aggressive and destabilizing. I thought that was a good caricature of not only what we have seen in our own country but also what we have seen overseas. And then he went on to say that right now we are not negotiating from a position of strength. Well, that is certainly true when our own President then, a few hours later, takes to the stage and says that this is simply fake news and that we are talking about Russia's aggression as some kind of response to the loss in the last campaign.  We need to know the full extent of the administration's contact with the Russian Government during the campaign and transition, including what was said, what was done, and who knew about it. Only then will we answer that fourth ``w.'' Who, what, where--it is the only way we are going to answer why. Why is this administration so focused on trying to placate Russia?  I recently joined Senators Cardin, Leahy, Feinstein, and Carper--this was early January--to introduce legislation that would create an independent, nonpartisan commission to look at the facts and to make recommendations about how we can handle future elections so they will be free and safeguarded from foreign interference. This would, of course, be in addition to the thorough investigation that I have been ensured will occur with the Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Senators Burr and  In the last few weeks, we have heard a lot about the three branches of government and our system of checks and balances. One of the fundamental jobs of Congress is to closely oversee the executive branch to ensure that the law is being properly followed and enforced. I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand how important that is.  I am the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, and one of our jobs is to oversee our election system. A big part of my job as the Democratic leader of this committee will be to ensure that our election system is safe from foreign interference in the future.  Intelligence experts have been clear: Russian interference in our 2016 election was not an anomaly. The threat of future tampering is real and immediate. As Senator Rubio said and I just noted, this time it was the Democrats who were attacked. Next time it could be a And it is not something that is limited to one party. Future threats could come in the form of more misinformation. They could range from using social media to disrupt the voting process to even hacking into State reporting websites to alter vote totals. Russia's goal is to create confusion and undermine people's trust in our democratic institutions. That is why they spent $200 million last year to fund the spread of fake news.  We need solutions and not more problems. Just last week, the House voted to eliminate the Election Assistance Commission, the only Federal agency charged with protecting American elections from hacking. As ranking member of the Rules Committee, I find this unconscionable. We have to do more, not less, to protect American elections from foreign interference.  The EAC and the Department of Homeland Security were in communication with State election officials prior to election day promoting cyber security best practices. Our agencies have ensured that safeguards, like provisional ballots, would allow people to cast ballots even if their systems were hacked. We have to do more, not less, to support this effort. That is why I am currently developing legislation that[[Page S1266]]will protect our elections from foreign interference. We are going to work with the EAC, DHS, and all 50 States to protect voting systems and registration data bases from cyber security threats. We will also make sure State and local election officials have the resources they need to make these critical cyber security upgrades.  Recent news events show us just how severe the problem is. Now we have to come up with the solutions. My Republican colleague, Senator McCain, got it right yesterday when he said this. This gets to the security issue that goes even beyond our elections:       General Flynn's resignation also raises further questions      about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir      Putin's Russia, including statements by the president      suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and      Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea,      and threats to our NATO allies.  The day that the Obama administration was imposing sanctions on Russia--and the Trump campaign was allegedly undermining those sanctions--I was with Senators McCain and Graham in Eastern The goal of our trip was to reenforce support for NATO and our allies in the face of increased Russian aggression. We visited the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia--countries on the frontlines of this fight, and they know Russia's playbook well.  In our meetings with Presidents and Prime Ministers of those countries, it was increasingly evident that if we don't stop Russia now, cyber attacking against governments, political parties, newspapers, and companies will only get worse.  This is a pattern of waging cyber attacks and military invasions against democratic governments across the world. Ukraine itself has been targeted by Russian hackers more than 6,500 times in just the past 2 months--earlier I used the examples of Estonia and Lithuania, but 6,500 times in just the past 2 months. Now we have evidence that Russia is working to undermine the elections in France and  This is not just about defending our own democracy; it is about defending the democratic way of life and democracies across the world. We must be a united front in fighting Russian aggression, and we must make it clear to Russia that there are consequences to their actions. That is why I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce the Countering Russian Hostilities Act, legislation that would impose strong actions against These sanctions would address cyber attacks, human rights violations, and the illegal annexation of land in Ukraine and  The world continues to look to America for its steadfast, steady leadership. The United States, a beacon for freedom and democracy, must continue to stand up against Russian aggression. The leader of our country should not be calling those reports that have been substantiated by 17 U.intelligence agencies ``fake news.'' That is what happened today.  On New Years' Eve, together with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and Senators McCain and Graham, we stood at the border of eastern Ukraine, 2 years after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, 2 years after the invasion of eastern Ukraine, 10,000 lives lost.  Ukrainian soldiers stood, and they have continued to stand, protecting their homeland and defending their democracy. For years, our allies have been subject to aggression and invasions, but they are undeterred, unwilling to give up what they fought so hard for: independence, freedom, and democracy. If we are committed to ensuring that Russia's hacking invasions and blackmail do not go unchecked, we must do everything in our power to uncover the full extent of this interference in our own political system. As our allies stand there every day losing people on the frontlines, looking to us for support, looking to us, we cannot turn our own backs on an invasion--a cyber invasion on our own democracy. We must also stand up for independence, freedom, and democracy.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young).

I think there must be improvements that are made. I[[Page S1617]]continue to be inspired by the families across my State, your State, and our country who work so hard to make it easier for kids to have access to drugs to treat their illnesses. Unfortunately, we haven't yet achieved all we can do for these families, and I have heard time and again about the emotional roller coaster that many of them have experienced when they interact with the Federal Government on new approaches for these rare disease conditions. Too often they are unaware when drugs are under review or confused about why experts or patients are not even consulted. The individuals suffering from these conditions and their families need greater clarity about the process for evaluating and approving these drugs, and they ought to be included and informed every step of the way.  It is critical that treatments that do exist for those with rare conditions be accessible and affordable. We must continue to protect the individuals from discrimination in insurance coverage and work to bring down costs. We have to ensure that incentives designed to spur the development and accessibility of treatments that the rare disease community desperately needs are not abused.

8606,topic-id,286,"Well, that is going to be very important and really an opportunity to make sure that this works for patients with rare diseases and their families. We know that affordability and accessibility remain paramount. We should also think about the burden that these conditions play and the critical role of the voice of the patient.  As you stated, Senator Hatch, more than 7,000 rare diseases exist, and the vast majority have no treatment. This is an extraordinary burden borne every day by Americans in every single State across the country. As we seek to continue making progress, including monitoring implementation of the advances in the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, we must ensure that rare disease treatments receive sufficient attention.  We also must encourage Federal agencies to better incorporate the patient's voice in their decisionmaking process. As I mentioned earlier, all too often as we rightly focus on evidence-based medicine, we can lose sight of the human experience of these and different therapies. What may seem simple in a lab may be overwhelming or difficult when applied to patients in real life situations--all the more so when children are involved. The FDA and all agencies should ensure that they have appropriate processes to seek and incorporate this vital input. The user fee agreement will be an opportunity for us to make this case.  I would like to thank Senator Hatch again for his time to discuss these issues that are very important to both of us. We look forward to engaging with our colleagues on these issues as we move forward to the implementation of the Cures Act, as well as the work on the Orphan Drugs Act, and as well as the user fee agreement.

8541,topic-id,2750,"Mr.President, it is an absolute honor to be able to rise and speak in support of Attorney General Scott For the last 6 years, Scott has been a leader in the State of He has been strongly committed to enforcing the law in Oklahoma as it is written and as is consistent with the He is a statesman. He is a dedicated public servant.  As the Administrator of the EPA, I fully expect Scott to be able to lead the Agency to follow every environmental law and to partner with States, local authorities, and tribes to do what is best for the present and for the future. I have heard some people talk about their opposition to Scott's nomination, saying they don't believe Scott believes in clean air, in clean water.  That is not the issue for Scott absolutely believes in clean air and clean water, and the accusations that somehow he wants dirty air and dirty water and our children to be poisoned is ludicrous.  The question for Scott is not if we should have clean air and clean water, it is who is the primary steward of our clean air and our clean water. Everyone has a role. We are a nation that is connected to each other. What happens in one State does affect another That is why we have a national strategy working with the Environmental Protection Agency, but in the Clean Water Act and in the Clean Air Act, the States are given primary responsibility through what is called a State Implementation Plan to determine what is in their best interests and the best solutions to be able to deal with the issues of air and water.  Scott has fought for the State to be allowed to be in the driver's seat with regard to all of the State resources, arguing for those that work in wind farms, in oilfields, and on cattle ranches, for families who have drinking water and breathe the air and who live there. The people who should have the loudest voices should be the people who actually drink that water and breathe that air and understand the effects of it firsthand.  He has not been alone in this fight. As the attorney general of Oklahoma, he stood shoulder to shoulder with more than half of the States to ensure the Federal Government operates within the bounds of the statutes and the He has consistently argued that the EPA, when they promulgate rules that violate that basic principle of the State Implementation Plan, should stop, do what the EPA does best, and have the EPA push the States to do what they should do best.  In an environment where Chevron deference is the precedent set, it is critical that the leader of an Agency that has such wide latitude to extract costs out of the economy, should respect the federalist foundation we have, and the pocketbooks of hard-working families, as well as our air and our water.  In previous congressional testimony, he stressed the importance of laws like the Clean Air Act, stressing that the intention was for States to work together under a model of cooperative federalism that protects the environment while considering economic costs.  Scott pursued cases against the EPA and other Federal agencies in an effort to enable and embolden our State government officials to craft the legislation that needs to be done. His focus has been not to eliminate environmental protections, it is to honor a country with tremendous diversity, from rocky mountains to open deserts, to beautiful woodland areas.  Surprisingly enough, the issues that we face on our environment, in the concrete jungle of Washington, DC, is different than it is in Woodward, Let me give you an example of one of those cases that he engaged in. It is a case where the EPA created a new regulation called waters of the United It dramatically changed the definition of what are the areas the EPA can oversee and increased their regulatory authority by millions of acres in just one regulatory sweep.  The courts immediately stepped in and stopped this, and Scott Pruitt and many other States' attorneys general said: The EPA does not have the right to be able to step into almost every inch of our State and say they suddenly have regulatory authority.  In fact, the court said this: ``We conclude that petitioners have demonstrated a substantial possibility of success on the merits of their claims.''  Furthermore, they said this: ``What is of greater concern to us, in balancing the harms, is the burden--potentially visited nationwide on government bodies, state and federal, as well as private parties.''  The court stepped in and agreed with Scott Pruitt that the EPA was overreaching, and that case is still in the courts right now. That is a reasonable thing to be able to do, for an attorney general who has the responsibility to not only manage the legal issues of the State but also to watch out for the consumers of the As funny as it sounds, if you go to the EPA's website today and look at Oklahoma and air quality, here is what it says. The EPA website today reads: ``CAA permitting in Clean Air Act permitting in Oklahoma is the responsibility of the Air Quality Division Exit of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.''  The EPA's website today says responsibility for this is from the Department of Environmental Quality in  All our attorney general has done is said to the EPA: You should probably follow the law or at least your own website to be able to handle all of the permitting issues of who has authority to do this. For the past month, I have heard Senator after Senator come to this floor and describe my great State of Oklahoma in a way that makes Scott Pruitt sound like an ogre and my State sound like a toxic waste dump.  Let me give you an example. Attorney General Pruitt has been dismissed by some who say that he has personally been engaged in leading our State to such terrible air quality that the American Lung Association has given the counties in Oklahoma an F rating.  Well, that is an interesting accusation, until you actually go to the American Lung Association website[[Page S1268]]and see that they give almost every county in America an F rating. In fact, they give every county in Delaware an F rating in air quality. They categorize those under ``high ozone days'' and one of three counties just barely skated by with a D in particle pollution for Delaware, while in Oklahoma the two largest metropolitan areas actually received an A from the American Lung Similarly, in that same study, Rhode Island lacks a single county that doesn't get an F for air quality on high ozone days, while only two counties received passing grades for particulate pollution.  The accusation that somehow the American Lung Association has looked at Scott Pruitt and his record on environmental policy and has given us dirty air quality is not actually true when you see the full study.  What is interesting, as well, is that the EPA publishes data about whether counties meet the national ambient air quality standards, and they have six criteria that the EPA puts out. In fact, recently they dropped their criteria significantly from the previous years. What is interesting, as well, is that for Oklahoma, last week, the EPA released their national ambient air quality standards, trying to determine which counties had attainment of the standard or nonattainment. Guest what. Every single county in Oklahoma--all 77--have attainment. Even as to the new standard that was just released, that we don't even have to operate under, we already meet those standards for ambient air quality.  Meanwhile, Maryland has 12 counties in nonattainment for at least 1 of those criteria. Connecticut has eight counties that don't meet those standards. California has 38 of their 58 counties failing to meet those standards in at least 1 criteria. There are 77 counties in Oklahoma, and every single one of them meets attainment.  I don't hear anyone standing on this floor challenging the attorney general of California or of Maryland or of Connecticut and demonizing them and accusing them of not taking care of the air and the water in their  By the way, I have also heard on this floor, as my State is being ripped apart for political gain, over and over that asthma rates for children are catastrophically high in Oklahoma and that Scott Pruitt should have been more engaged, filing lawsuits so that asthma rates would go down--until you look at the CDC website for asthma rates for children. It is 10.1 in One child is too many. It is 10.1 percent in our State, but you can compare that to Rhode Island, which is 12.4; or Michigan, which is 10.7. Vermont beat us, by the way. They are 9.9--0.2 below us.  Again, I don't hear anyone on this floor calling out the attorneys general of Vermont, Michigan, and Rhode Island and saying they failed to protect their children because children have asthma in their  Another thing that is commonly said about Scott Pruitt and the State of Oklahoma is that he is committed to conventional energy sources and that he is stuck in the past, dealing with oil and gas.  I will tell you that Oklahoma is rightfully right proud of its history of oil and gas in our We have unlocked resources that have absolutely powered our Nation forward. We also have an incredible group of visionaries in our State that are driving renewable resources as fast as we are driving oil and gas in our  For all the folks that are here bashing oil and gas, I would remind you that you traveled to Washington, DC, on a plane, in a car, or on a train that was powered by Oklahoma energy. So you are welcome. And I will assume that, 2 weeks from now, when we return back for session, you are going to ride in on a horse just to be able to spite Oklahoma's energy--probably not. But can I remind you of something?  What is often overlooked about Oklahoma and what has not been stated here is that Oklahoma truly is an all-of-the-above energy State--solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, oil, gas, and coal.  Let me give you an example--just one of the examples from that. Recent data shows that Oklahoma ranks third nationally in total wind power. We just passed California for total wind production. We are just barely behind Iowa and The installed capacity for Oklahoma alone--just in wind generation--is 1.3 million households powered by wind power out of  I will admit that I am a little biased about my But I am weary of hearing people inaccurately demean the air and water in Oklahoma and try to accuse it of something that is not true for their political benefit.  Here is my invitation to any Member of this body. Why don't you come home to Oklahoma with me? I will buy you some great barbecue and drive you around the I will take you through the Green Country in the northeast part of the State, over to Kenton, OK, and Black Mesa to see the majestic area around our panhandle. We will drive four-wheelers in Little Sahara, and maybe we will drive down to Beavers Bend Park, stand under the tall trees, and put our feet in the crystal clear water of that river. I will even take you to my house in Oklahoma City, a community of a million people that exceeds the EPA air quality standards for ambient air quality.  We say in Oklahoma: ``The land we belong to is grand,'' and we mean it. We are passionate about our land, and we are passionate about our air and water. I will tell you that Scott Pruitt is passionate about his State and what we do there.  I will tell you how political this has really become. Mike Turpen is the former attorney general of the State of Oklahoma and, by the way, he is also the former chairman of the Oklahoma Democratic Mike Turpen, when it was announced that Scott Pruitt was going to be tapped to be head of the EPA, released this statement:       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a good choice to      head up the Environmental Protection I am convinced      Scott Pruitt will work to protect our natural habitats,      reserves and resources. His vision for a proper relationship      between protection and prosperity makes him superbly      qualified to serve as our next EPA administrator.  That is from the former head of the Oklahoma Democratic  So far, my colleagues have found a good reason for every Cabinet nominee to delay, delay, delay. This has now been the slowest confirmation process for any President since George The tradition has always been that the President won an election, and he should be able to hire his own staff and his own Cabinet and get busy going to work. That is what the American people asked him to do.  Scott Pruitt deserves an up-or-down vote, and he deserves our trust to be able to take on and follow the law, doing what the EPA requires him to do.  Scott Pruitt is a friend. I understand that some of the folks who have attacked him have only met him at a hearing or read about him on some blog site. But I have prayed with I have seen Scott struggle with the hard decisions that affect our State's future. I have seen Scott listen to people from all sides of an issue, and I have seen him take difficult stands. I think he will be an excellent EPA Administrator, and I think he will make some wise choices to not only protect what is happening now but to be able to help protect us for the future.  You see, Scott is a husband and a dad as well, and he cares also about the future of our country. I think he is going to go after it, and he will be able to be an excellent Administrator in the days ahead.                         Tribute to Bryan Berky  Mr.President, I would like to take a quick moment just to be able to reflect. I have a staff member named Bryan He is running off. He has been quite a leader. He is leaving us to be able to take on a new task and a new role.  Since 2010, he has been a tremendous asset to the Bryan Berky is a student of Senate procedures. He is the one in the office whom everyone wishes they had because, when something comes up and someone has some novel new idea of how the rules work, he is typically the one on the corner saying: Yes, that really won't work, and here is why.  He has been sharp on budget issues, on tax issues, and efficiency in government. He has been the one who has been passionate about the national debt--and not just talking about national debt but actually trying to solve it.  You see, Bryan Berky is one of those unique staffers not trying to make a[[Page S1269]]point. He is trying to actually solve the problem.  He was mentored by a guy named Tom Coburn, who wasn't too bad on those issues himself. He has led well, and I am proud that he has been on my staff.  As he leaves from the Senate, he will be sorely missed by this whole body--even by people who never met him. He had an impact, based on the things that he worked on.  If you want to get a chance to visit with Bryan Berky, though, you can talk about Senate procedures, tax policy, and nerdy budget issues or you can chat with him about Oklahoma State football. He spent his time through college working for the Oklahoma State football team, watching the films and breaking down every single play, preparing the team for practice and for the game days.  He is a great student of people and of process.  I just want to be able to pass on to the Presiding Officer that there is a guy named Bryan Berky who is leaving the Senate in the next week, and he will be sorely missed by this Senate and by our team in the days ahead.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1230.txt,2050,DISAPPROVING THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO,2017.0,16.0,March

8536,topic-id,988,"Mr.President, I am proud to stand today and support Scott Pruitt, President Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection  I can think of no one who is better suited or more fully qualified to lead this Agency and to advance within it the reforms it so desperately needs. I look forward to voting to confirm Mr.Pruitt as EPA Administrator, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.  In many ways, the EPA epitomizes the broken status quo in Washington--a status quo that is increasingly and rightfully viewed with suspicion and a certain amount of contempt by the American people. That broken and discredited status quo has been described in various ways: out of touch, arbitrary, inflexible, unreasonable, heavyhanded, unaccountable. These words could apply to any number of institutions or offices here in Washington, DC, but they are the hallmarks of the rule-writing departments that make up our Federal bureaucracy.  Technically, these bureaucratic agencies are creatures of the executive branch--creatures that exist to assist the President in fulfilling his constitutional duty to take care that the laws, written by the legislative branch, are to be faithfully executed. But over the past several decades, they have been recast as the Federal Government's center of gravity, both writing and enforcing and, in many cases, even interpreting, the vast majority of laws governing America's society and America's economy.  Elevating the unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy to the driver's seat of the Federal Government--to the driver's seat, specifically, of Federal policymaking--is mostly the work of Members of Congress, of both Chambers and of both political parties, who understand that the best way to avoid being blamed by voters for unpopular laws is not to make them--at least not to make them completely--but rather to empower unelected bureaucrats to make the laws for them. But the regulatory agencies themselves sometimes deserve some of the blame as well.  Congress is guilty of writing laws that are couched in vague terms, centered around gauzy goals, instead of strictly defined as understandable rules. But Federal regulators are guilty of interpreting--and repeatedly reinterpreting--those laws in order to accommodate their ever-expanding conception of their own power, of their own authority to work their own will on the American people.  For instance, in the years since Congress passed the Clean Air Act amendments in 1977, Federal bureaucrats have used the law to enact more than 13,500 pages of regulations, which works out to roughly 30 pages of regulations for every 1 page of underlying legislative text.  The fundamental problem with this expansion and centralization of regulatory authority is the tendency of[[Page S1262]]Washington, DC, bureaucrats to be ignorant of--and often very indifferent to--the interests of the people who live in the various communities who are affected by the rules they make and the rules they also enforce.  This isn't a knock on the individual men and women who work within the Federal bureaucracy, most of whom are well-educated, well-intentioned, and highly specialized. But there is no doubt that a regulator in Washington, DC, knows a whole lot less about a melon farm in Emery County, UT, and cares a lot less about the fate of the people who work at that melon farm in Emery County, UT, than what the regulators say in Salt Lake  The Environmental Protection Agency, in particular, is notorious for its top-down, Washington-knows-best approach to regulation, which often runs roughshod over the immense diversity of local circumstances in our large country.  Too often, the EPA treats States and State regulators not as partners but as adversaries. It treats the States themselves not as laboratories of republican democracy but, rather, as lab rats to be tested upon for their own amusement and for the exertion of their own political power.  Scott Pruitt understands this well because he has seen it firsthand as attorney general of Mr.Pruitt has spent many years being ignored and pushed around by Washington, an experience that has taught him the need for the EPA to work with and not condescend to the  In his Senate confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt explained why improving the relationship between the EPA and State-level regulators is the best way to protect our environment and uphold the separation of powers that is the cornerstone of our constitutional system. He said: ``Cooperative Federalism is at the heart of many of the environmental statutes that involve the Environmental Protection Agency.''  The reason for that is that it is the States that many times have the resources, the expertise, and an understanding of the unique challenges of protecting our environment and improving our water and our air. We need a true partnership between the EPA in performing its roll, along with the States in performing theirs. If we have that partnership, as opposed to punishment, as opposed to the uncertainty and duress that we currently see in the marketplace, I think we will have better air and better water quality as a result.  For many Americans--and certainly for many of my fellow Utahns--the EPA is pejorative. It is synonymous with an out-of-touch and out-of-control government.  This is a shame. Americans want--and Americans certainly deserve--clean air and clean water. The EPA has the potential to help them achieve these goals, but only if the EPA itself returns to its core mission and works well, works wisely to accomplish that mission, and works within our constitutional system.  That is why I am so pleased that Scott Pruitt is on his way to lead the The Agency exists to protect the American people, not advance the narrow agenda of some special interests while punishing others.  I am confident that Mr.Pruitt is the right man for the job and that he will remain independent while correcting the troubling course that the EPA has taken in recent decades.

8516,topic-id,1461,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee asked Scott Pruitt for critical information on his environmental record as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt said no to the Environment and Public Works  When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee asked our fellow Republicans to delay Mr.Pruitt's vote until he got that important information, the Republican leadership here said: No, we won't wait for that critical information so that all Senators and the American people can understand who is being nominated.  When I asked Scott Pruitt if he would recuse himself from all issues relating to the cases that he has brought against the EPA as Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt said no to me.  Today we are here to respond to these very serious issues that are being raised about his ability to be an impartial Administrator of the EPA because the question before the American people and the Senate is whether Scott Pruitt should be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and that answer is no.  The EPA is our cop on the beat, protecting the American people and our environment from harmful pollution, hazardous waste, and the impacts of climate change. But as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt has tried to undermine the clean water rule and the Clean Air Act, putting the public health of millions of Americans at risk.  Scott Pruitt questions the science of climate change. Scott Pruitt has accused the EPA of overestimating air pollution from drilling of natural gas wells in Scott Pruitt has argued against President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which the EPA is supposed to implement. Scott Pruitt has sued to block the EPA from restricting mercury, a toxin that causes brain damage in children in the United  The only thing that Scott Pruitt is certain of is that he wants to represent the interests of the fossil fuel industry. He wants to change the environmental watchdog into a polluter lapdog. And today we are drawing a line out here on the Senate floor because it is critical that the American people understand the moral implications for the water Americans drink, for the air they breathe, for the mercury that could go into the blood systems of children in our country, for the amount of smog that is allowed to be sent into the air, the amount of haze that is created across our country, and why the nomination of Scott Pruitt leads inevitably, inexplicably toward more pollution, more unhealthy air, and more unhealthy water going into the systems of our families across our country.  That really goes to what the moral duty is of the Senate, the moral duty we have to ordinary families across the country. Do Americans really think the air we are breathing is too clean? Do people really believe the water we drink is too clean? Do people really want to water down those standards? Do they want to reduce the safeguards we have put in place?  One hundred years ago, life expectancy in the United States was about 48 years of age. In other words, we had gone from the Garden of Eden all the way to about 100 years ago, and we had increased life expectancy to about 48 years of age--not much progress. Now, it was always good for the Methuselah family. The wealthy always did pretty well. They could protect themselves from the things that would affect ordinary families, poorer families, from the Bible to 100 years ago. But then what happened? All of a sudden there was an awakening in our country that we had to make sure the sewage systems in our country were not going to be able to pollute families across our society. Then step by step, beginning with sewage and water, we in our Nation came to understand that we had to remove the majority of pollutants that were out there that were damaging the lives of ordinary That was a change that transformed not just the United States but, over time, the whole rest of the world.  Now, 100 years later, life expectancy goes out to age 80. In other words, we have added 32 years of bonus life to the average American over the last 100 years. And what did it? Well, it is no[[Page S1248]]secret formula; it is just that we looked around and we saw the things we had to put in place in order to protect families, and we took a moral responsibility to make sure that those industries, especially those that were not providing protections, were forced to provide protections for those ordinary people.  Here we are now considering Scott Pruitt as the new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Here is what Mr.Pruitt has done as the attorney general of Oklahoma: He has sued the national Environmental Protection Agency for the State of Oklahoma 19 times, and the issues on which he has sued are almost a litany of the things that go right to the heart of the protections the American people want for their families.  There are still eight cases that he brought pending before the  I said to Scott Pruitt in the confirmation hearing: Attorney General Pruitt, will you recuse yourself from consideration of any of those eight pending cases during the time you are Administrator of the EPA if you are confirmed? And Mr.Pruitt said no. Well, as I said to him in the hearing, if you do not recuse yourself, Mr.Pruitt, that turns you into the plaintiff, the defendant, the judge, and the jury for all of those cases, and that is just an unconscionable conflict of interest. As a result, he would never be seen as an impartial Administrator at the EPA as he moved forward trying to repeal or weaken environmental protections through regulations that he originally sought to accomplish through litigation.  We all know that across our country, overwhelmingly, the American people want--in the highest possible polling numbers, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative--they want the EPA to protect clean air, clean water, public health. They don't want children unnecessarily being exposed to pollutants in the atmosphere that can cause asthma. Those numbers are going up. The goal in America is to see the numbers go down, but that will not be the agenda Scott Pruitt brings to the EPA if he is, in fact, confirmed.  This question of his fitness for this job also goes to the question of climate change. The science of climate change is now well established.  Pope Francis came to the Capitol a year and a half ago to deliver his sermon on the hill to us, and what Pope Francis said to us is very simple: 1, that the planet is dangerously warming and that it is something which is being caused by human activity largely and that those who are going to be most adversely affected are the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. As the Pope said, we have a moral responsibility to do something about it as the most powerful country in the world and, along with China, the leading polluter in the world. This is Pope Francis talking to us about climate change.  What does Scott Pruitt say about climate science? He says he is not quite certain any actions really have to be taken in order to deal with that issue. Well, we have a Pope who actually taught high school chemistry and who delivered a science and morality lesson to the He told us that science is certain, and he told us that our moral obligation is unavoidable.  If we had a nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency who embraced that science and morality, I would be voting for him, but that is not who Scott Pruitt is. He is ignoring the impact the fossil fuel industry is having, and he is unwilling to commit to taking steps that can reduce that danger for our planet and for the most vulnerable on the planet.  So I stand in opposition to his nomination, as I will be standing out here all day and into the night. I don't think that we are going to have a more important discussion than the direction of the health of our planet and the health of the children in our country. I think it is something that the American people have to hear all day and through the night.  With that, I see the arrival of the Senator from I know that he has time to speak on the Senate floor. So I yield back my time so that my good friend Senator Portman can be recognized.

8330,topic-id,730,"Mr.President, I would like to take just a few moments of the Senate's time this evening. We all work in an environment in which we are surrounded by dedicated people. One of those in my world, Todd Novascone, who has been my chief of staff for 12 years, has had his last day of work in our office today. I wanted to take just a few moments to pay tribute to him and others like him.[[Page S386]]  I think we are here because we want to make a difference. I have no doubt that is the case for my 99 colleagues here on the Senate floor, but it is also true for all the folks who work here in the Senate Chamber, who work in our individual offices, and who work in the committees. The goal is to be in the Nation's Capital in the hope that we can make better things happen for I have had the privilege of being surrounded by many dedicated individuals--most of them Kansans--over the period of time that I have served in the Congress of the United States of I know that my ability to work on behalf of Kansans and on behalf of the citizens of our Nation is greatly altered and improved by the fact that people who care about America, who care about our home State, are there by my side. One of those most important to me has been my chief of staff.  Todd was an elected official in his own right. He was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives and served there with distinction. Twelve years ago, back in the days when I was a Member of the U.House of Representatives, I asked him to uproot his family and move to Washington, DC, and assume the task of managing our office and helping accomplish the things that we all wanted to accomplish. He has done it with great style and with grace and with friendship. He has been the person who has motivated us to do better and has always done it in a way in which we felt good about what we were doing, in a management style that made us feel good about ourselves, bringing us together, not taking us apart, making certain we knew that the outcome was important, but how we got there--matters that are important to us as individuals, as human beings with integrity, doing things right, telling the truth--those things were always honored and achieved because of his leadership.  People are hard to replace, and Todd is especially difficult to replace. I spend almost every week in the Nation's Capital, away from my own family. Like many people here in the Senate, those who work in our offices become part of our family. That is certainly true with the people who work in my office today. I feel that, although when I came to Congress I was more their age, now there is a significantly wider gap in the age of our staff and me. But my wife and I believe that I am surrounded by people who are part of our family, and Todd is certainly that. In fact, his family grew while he was my chief of staff. His two children, Grace and Will, were born during the days of his time as an employee in our office. Again, as a reminder about how to put things in perspective, he was always taking care of his kids. He was always there for their school activities, part of the school board, involved in their athletic and musical activities. That is a good thing for a chief of staff to know because if it is important to him, he will make certain that his commitment is permitted, honored, and encouraged by those who work in the office.  So tonight, I just want to say thank you to Todd Novascone from Hanover, KS, who decided to devote 12 years of his life here in the Nation's Capital, trying to make things better, trying to make our office work well, and trying to achieve the things all of us want to achieve for our So, Todd Novascone, thank you for a job well done, thank you for being my friend, and thank you for the way you have conducted yourself on my behalf.

8616,topic-id,896,"Mr.President, we are coming to the end of debate on the disapproval resolution for the BLM Planning 2.0 I would like to take just a few minutes to highlight the very broad support it has drawn here on Capitol Hill but really across the country.  Here in the Senate, I mentioned earlier that there is a total of 17 Members who have joined me in sponsoring our version of this resolution. That is nearly one-fifth of this It includes every Republican from a Western State with BLM lands within its borders. These are Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, even Kentucky, and the State of the occupant of the Chair, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, so a very strong contingent of Members who are in support of this disapproval resolution.  Across the Capitol, the House of Representatives passed this resolution with bipartisan support a couple of weeks ago through the leadership of Representative Cheney of This resolution wound up with 234 votes in the That is a pretty strong vote.  The reason why so many Members of the House and the Senate want to overturn BLM's planning 2.0 Rule is pretty simple. We know what it means for our Western We don't like the impacts that it will have and neither do a wide variety of elected officials and stakeholders back home.  In my State of Alaska, I have heard from the Alaska Municipal League, the Alaska Farm Bureau, and the Associated General Contractors of The Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce wrote to ask us to overturn the rule. The Alaska Chamber wrote in support of our resolution because they said BLM's planning process ``has grown to be substantially lengthier, more confusing, and burdensome for stakeholders to engage in.''  We have heard from our leaders in the Alaska State Legislature, State Senators Pete Kelly and John Coghill, who have asked for this rule to be nullified, as have several of our Alaska Native corporations, including CIRI, Olgoonik, and Calista The Alaska chapter of the Safari Club opposes it because its landscape-level approach to land management planning has the potential to withdraw and lock up even more land in  Alaska's energy, mineral, and timber producers are united in their opposition to this rule and in their support of our disapproval resolution. We have heard from the Resource Development Council, the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, the Alaska Forest Association, the Council of Alaska Producers, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, the Fortymile Mining District, and the Alaska Miners Association, and they all oppose BLM's planning 2.0 Rule because it reduces economic opportunities for Alaskans--those who actually live near these BLM lands, who know[[Page S1624]]the most about them, and who depend on them to provide for their families.

The National Association of Counties, the voice of county governments all across the country, sent a letter outlining their support for the disapproval resolution. Another group, the National Association of Conservation Districts, wrote that planning 2.0 should be repealed because it ``skirts the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and reduces the ability of local government involvement'' while seeming ``forced and blind to the many issues raised in the public comment period.''  Again, this disapproval resolution has drawn strong support from a wide range of stakeholder groups--energy, mining, and grazing, America's farmers and ranchers, State officials, local counties, and conservation districts. Everything from the Alaska Trucking Association to the Public Lands Council and the U.Chamber of Commerce have all weighed in. At last count, more than 80 groups had asked us to repeal BLM's planning 2.0 Rule, and I am sure there are many others that are not included in that count.  We have heard such strong support because this is a misguided rule that will negatively impact our Western It subverts the special status relationship between the Federal Government and the States and local governments. It limits local involvement and local input. It opens the door for decisionmaking authority to be centralized at BLM's headquarters here in Washington, It upends BLM's multiple-use mission by allowing the agency to pick and choose among preferred uses, while sidelining industries that provide good-paying jobs in our western communities.  I think there is broad agreement that planning 2.0 should be overturned. That is what we are here to do, and we will have that opportunity in just a few moments.

8613,topic-id,2318,"Mr.President, TrumpCare is here, and you are going to hate it. This replacement for the Affordable Care Act has been 7 years in the making. On a cursory overview, it appears that when you ask the question as to who gets hurt under the replacement plan, the answer is everyone, with the exception of insurance companies, drug companies, and the very wealthy.  I hope we are able to step back and take our time to analyze what this replacement plan is going to do to Americans who badly need healthcare, who believed Republicans when they told them that they were going to repeal the bill and replace it with something better, and who believed President Trump when he said that he was going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that was wonderful, that insured everybody who was insured under the Affordable Care Act and did it at lower costs.  I know that my colleagues who are well meaning in this Chamber cannot read this replacement plan and understand it to do anything but strip coverage away from millions of Americans and to drive up costs for millions of There is no credible way to look at this replacement plan without seeing the devastation that will be wrought.  I want to spend just a few minutes, now that we have had this plan to look at for 24 hours, talking about how dangerous it is and pleading with my Republican colleagues to take their time and, hopefully, decide instead to work with Democrats to try to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, fix what is not working as well, but preserve the parts that are working.  Here is what I mean when I say that everyone, with the exception of insurance companies, drug companies, and the superrich, is hurt by the GOP replacement plan. First, this idea that we are going to end the Medicaid expansion--that is what this replacement plan does. It says that in 2 years, effectively 2020, the Medicaid expansion will go away. That means in my State, 200,000 people will lose healthcare. Millions across the country will lose healthcare. They are, by and large, the poor and the lower middle class--largely women and children who can't get insurance other than through the Medicaid expansion--who will no longer be able to get it. Medicaid has been expanded in Democratic States, Republican States, blue States, red Letting Medicaid expansion hang around for 2 years is no solace to people who will jam into those years as much healthcare as they can get, but then be without it afterwards.  Even more insidious is the part of the GOP healthcare replacement plan that would turn Medicaid into a block grant after 2020. This has been talked about in conservative circles for a long time, but has been resisted, again, by Democrats and Republicans who understand what that means. It means Medicaid will eventually wither on the vine and will become a State responsibility. No longer will the Federal Government help States pick up the costs for insuring the most vulnerable citizens.  Remember who Medicaid covers. Medicaid covers 60 percent of children with disabilities in this country. Of the tens of millions of kids living with disabilities, 6 out of 10 of them get their insurance from If Medicaid is turned into a block grant, let me just tell you, let me guarantee you that healthcare will end for millions of those kids. If it does not end, it will be dramatically scaled back because States cannot afford to pick up 60, 70, 80 percent eventually of the cost.  Thirty percent of non-elderly adults with disabilities are covered by Sixty-four percent of nursing home residents are covered by Two out of every three of our senior citizens who are living in nursing homes are covered by If you block-grant Medicaid, all of a sudden States will not be able to pick up those costs and will not be able to deliver healthcare to people in nursing homes. That is just the truth.  The Republican bill effectively ends coverage for 11 million people all across this country who are covered by the Medicaid expansion after 2 years, and then it jeopardizes care for tens of millions more by dramatically cutting the Medicaid Program and the Medicaid reimbursement to This is not a game; this is 11 million people.  Remember, it is not a guess because in 2020 you will be reverting back to the rules before the Affordable Care Before the Affordable Care Act, 11 million fewer people were covered under Even if States maybe hang around and decide to front the billions of dollars necessary to cover a few million of those, you are still talking about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 million people who will lose insurance--again, people who can't buy it anywhere else. This is people's lives we are playing with--as I mentioned, 200,000 in Connecticut alone.  Do you know who else gets hurt by this replacement plan? Older It seems that older Americans are really targeted in this plan because although the underlying Affordable Care Act says that you can't charge older Americans more than three times that of younger Americans, this replacement plan changes the rules. It allows insurance companies to jack up prices on older So a 60-year-old would have their premium go up by about one-quarter. That is roughly $3,000, according to an AARP study. I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but a lot of adults getting ready to qualify for Medicare in Connecticut don't have $3,000 sitting around.  But it gets worse. Because the premium support is so skimpy, under this plan, that same 60-year-old in Connecticut would have their premium support--their tax credit--cut in half, from $8,000 down to $4,000. Do the math. That is a $9,000 increase in healthcare costs for a 60-year-old resident in That is unaffordable. There is just no way for anybody to say that for that 60-year-old living in Connecticut or living in Nebraska or living in California, that is better healthcare. Nine thousand more dollars out of pocket for a 60-year-old is not better healthcare.  The claim is that this bill will cover people with preexisting conditions, but because there is no minimum benefit requirement, the plans don't have to cover anything that you need for your preexisting condition. So, yes, they can't technically charge someone with cancer more, but they don't have to cover chemotherapy. The Affordable Care Act says insurance has to be insurance. There has to be some minimum, basic level of benefits so that everybody knows that when they buy an insurance plan, they are basically getting coverage for maternity care, for cancer treatment, for mental illness. Because this legislation strips away any requirement that insurance be insurance, maybe you get insurance if you have cancer, but it may not cover anything you have.  Of course the cruelest piece of this bill says that if you lose insurance, you then get charged more. Republicans are right that in the Affordable Care Act as it exists today, there is a penalty if you don't buy insurance. Republicans just do their penalty differently. What this replacement plan says is that if you lose insurance and you try to get it later on, you will pay 30 percent more. I admit that there is a penalty in the underlying Affordable Care Act and there is a penalty in the Republican bill, but the problem is that under the existing Affordable Care Act, the help you get to buy insurance allows you to buy insurance. That is why 20 million people have insurance today. But because the tax credits are basically cut in half under this proposal, it will render healthcare unaffordable; thus, more people will have gaps in coverage; thus, more people will pay the penalty.  So in the end, this bill really does not provide protection for people with preexisting conditions because they are not going to be able to buy insurance in the first place. They are going to fall into that gap, and then they are going to have to pay more. Even if they do have insurance, it may not even cover what they need.  All of this is made harder to understand because it seems to be one big excuse to deliver a giant tax cut to the wealthy. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this bill would cut taxes by $600 billion for the wealthiest The Affordable Care Act was financed in part by a tax on unearned income for people making over $250,000 a year. I live in a pretty wealthy State--Connecticut--but people who are making $250,000 and a whole lot of unearned income are not amongst the most needy in our society. The average tax cut under this bill[[Page S1623]]would be $200,000. Why? Because we are taxing so few people who are making such big amounts of money, the average tax cut would be $200,000.  It is so hard to understand because when you do the sum total of parts that are moving under this replacement plan, it seems as if the biggest parts that are moving are care away from millions of poor people and the elderly and money going to the wealthiest 1 percent of That is not hyperbole; that is just how this bill works out.  The biggest net result of this bill from the status quo is that millions of people who are on Medicaid today in a few years won't have it--those are kids; those are the disabled; those are the elderly--and a handful of very wealthy Americans will make out with enormous tax cuts under this legislation.  I guess it is no secret that this bill was crafted behind closed doors. Seven years in the making, and this bill was hidden from public view until yesterday. Now House Republicans are saying they are going to give the American public 1 week to look at this. No estimate of the cost--they are going to ram it through as quickly as they can.  I held half a dozen townhalls in the summer of 2009, when the tea party tempest was at its highest, where people really wanted to talk to me about how upset they were with the way the healthcare debate was going. One of the refrains that I heard in those townhalls was that Democrats were ramming through the Affordable Care Everybody heard it. Ramming through the Affordable Care It was on FOX News every night. It was part of our townhalls regularly.  Well, let me tell you what happened in 2009. The House process spanned three committees: the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor The House had 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health reform bill--79 bipartisan hearings and markups. House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses, and considered 239 amendments and accepted 121. The HELP Committee had 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan hearings, and 20 bipartisan walkthroughs on health reform. The HELP Committee considered nearly 300 amendments and accepted 160 Republican amendments. The Finance Committee held a similar process. When the bill came to the floor, the Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on health reform--the second longest consecutive session in history.  So don't tell me that the Affordable Care Act was rushed through when during that time the HELP Committee considered 300 amendments, held dozens of hearings, and in 2017 there are going to be no committee meetings, no committee markups, no committee amendments, and barely a week for the public, for think tanks, for hospitals, for doctors, for patients to be able to consider the chaos that will be wrought if this healthcare plan goes through.  So I am on the floor today to plead with my Republican colleagues to step back from this potential debacle. This seems like it was written on the back of a napkin in order to rush something out into the public so that Republicans can claim they are fulfilling the promise they made, without thinking through the consequences.  Over and over again, I heard my Republican friends and President Trump say they are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better. I heard the new Secretary of Health and Human Services say that no one was going to lose insurance, that costs were not going to go up, and that the insurance protections were going to be preserved. None of that will be true under the current plan under consideration. Everybody knows it, which is why it is being hidden from public view.  Politicians love praise. We love good press. So if Republicans thought this was a praiseworthy plan, they would not be hiding it. They would not be trying to rush it through. They would be celebrating an achievement they have been crowing about for years--replacing the Affordable Care Act with something that is better.  This is worse for everyone except for insurance companies, drug companies, and the superrich. The superrich get a big tax cut, and all of the fees that were levied on the insurance companies and drug companies that were used to pay for additional expansion go away.  Tucked inside here, there is even a very specific tax cut for insurance company I mean, think about that. Tucked into this bill is a specific tax cut for a select group of individuals--insurance company I represent a lot of those CEOs, but it does not make it right.  I hope we will find a way to work together to try to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and fix what is wrong. The plan that was unveiled yesterday--I understand not by the Senate but by the House--hurts everybody except for a select few. I think most of my colleagues know we can do better.

8520,topic-id,829,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to vote no on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a nomination that marks yet another broken promise from the new President to put the needs of American families first over the wishes of big corporations and special interests. And just like we have seen with Betsy DeVos at the Department of Education or Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, we have yet another Trump nominee whose record demonstrates a direct conflict with the mission of the agency they wish to lead. On the EPA's website, that mission is pretty clear--``to protect human health and the environment''--and EPA achieves that by enforcing regulations based on laws passed by So I will be voting no on this nomination.  I want to make two points on why Mr.Pruitt heading up the EPA would be wrong for our country and why it would be wrong for the families I represent in Washington It starts with his record and clear conflicts of interest.  During Mr.Pruitt's term as the attorney general for Oklahoma, he filed no less than 19 cases to overturn environmental regulations, including one to topple the EPA's Clean Power These regulations specifically seek to protect public health by reducing harmful air and water pollution and are projected to save tens of thousands of lives each year.  As if it wasn't bad enough that Mr.Pruitt spent so much time filing lawsuits in court and fighting policies designed to protect the health of the environment as well as people, it is pretty shocking that at the same time, he was collecting millions of dollars from the very industries he will regulate if he is confirmed. This is no small conflict of interest between his former and potentially future position, and that he was still nominated to be EPA Administrator is mind-blowing to me.  I echo the sentiments of so many who have expressed serious concerns about Mr.Pruitt's conflict of interest, that his ties to the fossil fuel industry make him more indebted to backing policies that loosen environmental regulations, benefiting big oil and gas companies, rather than backing policies that protect the American people.  Mr.President, I want to voice another concern my constituents have shared with me. It is unnerving to think the President would choose a climate change denier to set our national environmental policy. I don't see how someone who has openly denied the existence of climate change--the devastating effects of which we are already beginning to see in Washington State and around the country--will effectively protect human health or the environment.  This is about more than just the environment. A report by the Congressional Budget Office last year found that climate change is a serious threat to our economic stability. As the occurrence of national disasters continues to rise, the cost of disaster assistance and rebuilding rises too.  If we want to be responsible about tackling our fiscal challenges--which I would think the President and Mr.Pruitt would agree on--we need to take the impacts of climate change seriously. At a time when we are already seeing the very real effects of climate change in my home State, from longer, more devastating wildfire seasons to ocean acidification and rising sea levels, it is more important than ever. This brings me to how Mr.Pruitt's confirmation would be devastating for my home State of  As someone who personally spends a great deal of time fishing and hiking in my home State of Washington, I am committed to conservation and preservation efforts so generations to come can appreciate the high quality of life we enjoy and experience the splendor of America's natural spaces, one of the most important being the restoration and recovery of salmon runs and habitat throughout the Pacific Northwest, which is a vital part of our Northwest economy and its heritage.  I am deeply concerned about whether this support would continue under an EPA Administrator like Mr.I have similar concerns about the Hanford cleanup, a critical part of our State's history that EPA plays a very important role in to protect the health and safety of our Tri-Cities community, Columbia River, and Washington  I will fight against any EPA nominee or an Administrator who will not join us in the fight for a better future for generations to come. I sincerely hope the President and Mr.Pruitt truly understand the enormous responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, not only in protecting our environment for future generations but for the families we represent who rely on clean air and clean water right now.  For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we need to act now to avoid lasting, irreversible damage to our health, our environment, our economy, and our country's future. I am not confident in putting that future in Scott Pruitt's hands.

8504,topic-id,1045,"Mr.President, I want to speak about this nomination from the standpoint of our State, our State of Florida, because we are famous for sugar-white beaches, fertile fishing grounds, and unique environmental treasures, such as the Florida These precious natural resources need our protection and our stewardship. In fact, Florida's multibillion-dollar tourism industry is driven by the fact that people come to our State to enjoy these kinds of environmental treasures.  I have just come from a meeting with the American Hotel & Lodging With multibillions of dollars of investments all over Florida, what happens if the guests don't come? That is a major investment that is lost.  And, oh, by the way, a few years ago during the BP oil spill--when the oil got only as far east from Louisiana as Pensacola Beach, and some oil was in Choctawhatchee Bay and Destin and some tar balls were as far east as Panama City Beach, but not any further--the visitors didn't come because they thought the beaches were covered with oil.  Well, right now Florida's unique environment is threatened by several environmental challenges, from the threat of fracking in this honeycomb of limestone filled with freshwater that supports the peninsula of Florida to algal blooms that have plagued much of Florida's Treasure Coast this last year, to the red tide in the Tampa Bay area, and to Burmese pythons in the And that is just a little bitty partialness of the plagues. To deal with these challenges, States such as ours depend on the EPA as a backstop.  I am here to express my concerns about the President's pick to lead this agency. It has been well documented that the President's pick is a friend of the oil industry. There is nothing wrong with that. But this is an industry that has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions to Mr.Pruitt and the PACs supporting him over the years.  Ever since I was a young Congressman, I have been fighting to keep oil rigs off the coast of In the first place, there is not a lot of oil out there, but Florida's unique environment--from what I just told you about, the BP oil spill--its tourism-driven economy, and, oh, by the way, the largest testing and training area for the U.military in the world, the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida, as well as all of the testing ranges on the east coast, and how about the rockets coming out of the[[Page S1242]]Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the rockets coming out of the Kennedy Space Center--because of all of those, you can't have oil rigs down there. For all of those reasons, it makes Florida incompatible with offshore oil drilling. An EPA Administrator with such close ties to the oil industry is deeply concerning for the people of  But Mr.Pruitt's ties to Big Oil aren't the only concern that we have in During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt said that he believes that his views on climate change are ``immaterial'' to the job of the EPA  Whoa, the EPA Administrator is directly involved in things that involve climate change. I can't think of a more relevant issue for our EPA Administrator to be concerned with because Florida is ground zero when it comes to the effects of sea level rise.  These are not projections, not forecasts. These are measurements over the last 40 years in South The sea has risen 5 to 8 inches.  By the way, where is three-quarters of the population of Florida? It is along the coast. We are already seeing regular flooding at the mean high tide in the streets of Miami Beach, and they are spending millions on infrastructure in order to get those pumps working to get the water off the streets and raising the level of the streets.  We are seeing the saltwater, which is heavier than freshwater, seep into the ground where there is a honeycomb of limestone filled with freshwater, and the seawater is seeping into the freshwater. So cities are having to move their city well fields further to the west because of the saltwater intrusion, and it only gets worse.  The threat Floridians face every day is a result of this sea level rise that is very real. It is critical that we have an EPA Administrator that understands that there are things that are happening because of climate change. It is not immaterial to the job of the EPA Administrator; it is very relevant.  There is Mr.Pruitt's history of questioning science, especially when the facts conflict with his friends, whom he surrounds himself with, about the effects of science. So whether it is protecting Florida's livestock from deadly parasites or protecting the air we breathe, science informs policy decisions that affect all of us--clean water, clean air. It affects public health, national security, and the environment.  Yet we continue to see troubling reports about scientists being muzzled from the State level all the way up to the Federal level in the So it just seems that this is unacceptable. Our scientists should be free to publish scientific data and not be muzzled. They should be able to publish their reports without fear of losing their jobs or being censored for using phrases like ``climate change.''  That is why I recently sponsored legislation to protect our scientists from political interference. The Scientific Integrity Act would ensure that Federal scientists can communicate their findings with the public. It requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce scientific integrity policies and ensure that procedures are in place so that if those policies are violated, it is known and there is a procedure to deal with that.  I conclude by stating that Floridians and the State of Florida cannot risk the health of our environment or our economy on an EPA Administrator who pals around with folks that do all of what I am talking about--they question our scientists, denying the true threat we face from sea level rise and climate change. Floridians can't afford such a risk, and they shouldn't be forced to take this risk.

8580,topic-id,239,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak out against President Trump's Muslim ban, an executive order that emboldens our enemies, undermines our alliances, and offends our American values. This ban has, among other things, blocked visas for interpreters from the Middle East, people who risk their lives to save American lives.  When I was deployed to Afghanistan as an intelligence officer, I worked with many interpreters; and at first, I realized they not only provided accurate information, they kept us safe. As time went along and I got to know them, what I came to realize is that they were the ones who were unsafe. They were the ones who were risking their lives to save our lives.  When I got to know them, I would ask them: Why are you taking this risk? Why are you doing this? And the reason they gave me was similar to the one my grandfather gave me, my Italian immigrant grandfather, as to why he came here to America back in 1921, and that is they came here to give their children a better life.

We not only honor military dogs, but also police dogs, customs dogs, border patrol dogs, and other working dogs that work to protect our communities.  These dogs provide an incredible service to our brave men and women overseas. They are responsible for saving lives and preventing injuries, sometimes at their own expense.  Many of our servicemembers form very strong bonds with these loyal companions. That is why I authored the Military Working Dog Military Retirement Act and was proud to see it pass with overwhelming bipartisan support last This new law guarantees that service dogs are returned and retired to the United States after serving overseas. Previously, military members were often forced to spend their own money to bring these animals home.  Mr.Speaker, let us remember and honor these four-legged heroes. They are a valuable component of protecting Americans through their courage and their loyalty.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2072-2.txt,1930,DISAPPROVING THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO,2017.0,15.0,February

8577,topic-id,738,"Mr.Speaker, the Affordable Care Act has saved thousands of Mainers from losing their lives or going bankrupt simply because they got sick. Quality of care has improved through preventative care, without cost sharing for consumers. Overall costs have been lowered.  Republicans have had 7 years to come up with an alternative healthcare plan that preserves the progress we have made under the Affordable Care Act--one that would not take us back to a time when many without employer-sponsored insurance or a clean bill of health could get coverage.  But after all this time, they have come up with a plan that will cost older Americans up to five times more than younger enrollees; will charge the uninsured 30 percent more to buy coverage; and it will defund, not defend, Planned Parenthood; cut Medicaid significantly; and still has no price tag.  We owe it to Americans to have an open debate on this proposal, and I expect my Republican colleagues not to forget the millions of Americans for whom the Affordable Care Act has been a lifesaver.  In January, I asked my constituents to share their Affordable Care Act stories. Within a few days, more than a thousand stories were submitted. Some shared their ongoing challenges. I agree there are opportunities to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make it affordable, but the overwhelming number of people shared compelling stories of how the Affordable Care Act has improved their lives.  I am honored to share a few of those powerful stories today, and I hope my Republican colleagues are listening.  Eleanor from Belfast, Maine, said:  ``I am a 63-year-old small-business owner who has health insurance for the first time in my adult life since passage of the Affordable Care The same is true for my partner of 17 years. She was diagnosed with breast cancer this year and has recently undergone a mastectomy with follow-up care. After her diagnosis, I went for my first-ever mammogram.''  The Republican plan puts these preventive services at risk.  Matthew from Brunswick, Maine, said:  ``Five years ago, I left a comfortable job with good benefits to start my own business. Those first years were tough on my family. My wife and I were able to put our children on Maine's Dirigo Health, but we had to do without. . . . Today, through God's grace, hard work, and the support of my wife; my business is prospering. Food assistance is a thing of the past and we're actually contributing more in taxes now than we ever did before. We still have to watch what we spend but we're breathing a lot easier. Each year that I've made more money our subsidy has gone down, and that's just as it should be. That subsidy still matters though. If the ACA were eliminated today and I had to buy health insurance on the open market I'd be paying an extra $4,800 a year. That's real money.''  Under the Republican plan, small-business owners like Matthew may not be able to afford care for their family.  Ret, a 9/11 first responder from Rockland, Maine, said:  `` . . . The ACA means that as a self-employed resident of the state of Maine, I can actually acquire coverage with a pre-existing condition. After working search and rescue/recovery at Ground Zero in 2001, I developed a lung condition necessitating costly medication. Before the ACA, I was terrified of losing my job and losing health care because of my pre-existing condition.''  Under the Republican plan, those with preexisting conditions, like our 9/11 first responders, may not get affordable coverage.  Elisabeth from Phippsburg, Maine, said:  ``In 2014 . . . my husband died from early-onset Alzheimer's. I was 50 when[[Page H1542]]my husband was diagnosed. Eventually I left the workforce to care for him . . . and, of course, lost my employer-provided health insurance at the same time. The ACA has provided me with options ever since then; options that I never had before its passage. In 2014 I had three joints replaced; life changing surgeries that restored my active lifestyle and removed chronic pain from my life. These were only possible because I was able to access health insurance as an individual, at a reasonable cost.''  The Republican plan for increasing costs for older Americans threatens people just like  These stories matter. These lives matter. We must all keep them in mind as we look to change the Affordable Care                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1541-2.txt,1927,TRIBUTE TO GARY SCHNEIDERS,2017.0,7.0,January
8414,topic-id,1912,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, one that provides for consideration of H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership  I strongly support the underlying legislation. I wish it had been brought forward to the floor under an open rule that allowed Democrats and Republicans to freely offer amendments that could be adopted by a simple majority vote.  Before we get to the specifics of the bill, I want to talk about the importance of employee ownership. I join my friend and colleague from my neighboring district in Colorado in extolling the virtues of employee stock ownership, of ensuring that employees in the company are stakeholders and able to benefit from the value that is being created.  You know, we have different stakeholders in our economy, and when you look at a company, you have different stakeholders that that company is responsible to and caters to: You have the shareholders, you have the employees, and you have the customers. In running a company, as I have done, it is always a constant balancing act to make sure that you are able to satisfy the legitimate demands of all those various stakeholders.  Now, one of the things that has been out of whack in our economy the last few decades is that a disproportionate share of the value creation has gone to the shareholders and the customers, often to the detriment of the employees.  Now, everybody has benefited as consumers and as customers with revolutions in prices and consumer technology. It is so exciting to see people, you know, where a flat screen television used to be out of reach, you now see them in nearly every home; and, in many cases, they cost less than a television would have cost that was significantly smaller 10 years ago--not to mention the remarkable mobile computing devices that middle class families and working families carry in their pockets with them that contains more processing power than a $3,000 computer did just a decade ago.  Consumers have benefited and shareholders have benefited. There has been an unprecedented increase in private equity markets, in stocks, a huge amount of value creation in the American economy, both on the balance sheet as well as in the market valuation of companies.  Now, the issue is that, while all of this has happened, wages have largely stagnated. A lot of the increases in efficiency and economic growth have gone to benefit consumers and shareholders. Employees and workers have felt, legitimately so, that they haven't seen their share of value creation.  Now, there are a number of reasons for that. One of those has been the weakening of the union movement that gave workers a collective voice. But if you look at what some of the remedies are, really none can make a bigger impact than employee stock ownership. This bill doesn't change the ball on that. It is a positive step.  There are a lot of other ideas that I hope we can talk about in a bipartisan way. Fundamentally, we need to create an economy that works for everyone, one in which employees and workers can directly benefit from the increase in value of the firm that they helped create. And what better way to do that than employee stock ownership in a variety of models and options for that. This bill deals with one; but we have ESOPs, we have co-ops, we have employee stock option plans, to name a few.  Companies find that it is in their interest to help improve morale and maintain a stable employee base to align the incentives of employees with shareholders and, of course, to help align the success of our economy with the success of all the stakeholders in our economy.  H.1343 is a bipartisan bill. It was passed last year; it will pass again overwhelmingly this year. It sends a strong statement that Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives want to make employee stock ownership easier. Hopefully, this is a starting point rather than an ending point.  The two other bills the Chamber is considering are also bipartisan, and I am hopeful that they can move forward expeditiously.  Now, that stands in stark contrast to some of the other actions of this Chamber, for instance, the 15 Congressional Review Act resolutions which simply sought to undo some of the positive steps that President Obama took rather than put forward a proactive agenda of where Republicans actually want to lead the  We also spent countless hours debating healthcare legislation that, thankfully, didn't go anywhere because it would have left 24 million Americans without health insurance and increased premiums by 15 to 20 percent for those who were lucky enough not to lose their insurance altogether.  I am glad that we have been able to move past that towards a more bipartisan discussion here that will fundamentally help American innovators and entrepreneurs and help lead to a fair economy that works better for everybody, that shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together to create a real solution that addresses a real problem and takes a first step towards creating an economy that works for workers, consumers, and shareholders.  I am hopeful that we can continue this trend after the district work period and move forward on bipartisan legislation that will simplify our complex Tax Code and realign incentives in[[Page H2643]]a positive way, fix our broken immigration system, and make sure that we have the infrastructure we need for our country to succeed in the 21st century. I hope that my colleagues are encouraged by the strong bipartisan show of support for H.1343 and we can work together to bring more bipartisan legislation to the floor instead of divisive bills that make problems even larger.  This bill, very simply, updates an SEC rule from 1999 that will allow private companies to offer employees a greater stake in the place they work without requiring additional paperwork or regulation--a simple and good idea.  Currently, a private company that offers over $5 million in securities through compensation for employees is required to provide additional disclosures which can, A, often serve as a detriment to going over the $5 million in compensatory stock for their employees, and, B, take up costs, administrative overhead, should they choose to proceed. H.1343 simply raises that threshold from $5 million to $10 million, and this legislation gives a private company more flexibility to reward and retain employees of all levels.  Employee ownership of various structures has benefits to both the company, the employees, and the overall economy. It helps align the interests. It results in more productivity, higher employee retention. It can help make a business more profitable and more sustainable. It helps make the American economy and the amazing value that is created work for everybody rather than just one of the stakeholder groups.  For many startups and small businesses, giving employees a stake in the business is a great way to provide an additional benefit, an incentive. It gives companies flexibility to attract new employees when they are starting up, to retain talent as a company grows and matures.  Providing workers stakes in their company helps strengthen their retirement savings. Employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, are a type of retirement plan that offers employees an ownership stake without upfront costs. In Colorado, there are 118 businesses that use employee-owned ESOPs as a way to promote employee ownership.  A good example of an ESOP is Fire Safety The owner, Jeff, wanted to offer his employees a stake in the business. He converted his business to an ESOP, an employee-owned company, that allowed him to create a succession plan so the business can stay locally owned by the people who worked to create the value. Jeff noted that, after the conversion, employee morale was up and sales were up.  One of our most famous examples of employee-owned companies is in my district in Fort Collins, Colorado: New Belgium From the perspective of the employees, New Belgium has a very strong corporate culture of personal and collective growth. The employee owners are concerned about their own professional development and that of their colleagues. They have a vested stake in the management, economic health, and stability of the company.  This bill is a commonsense approach and makes it easier for companies to give their employees ownership opportunities. It is a small first step towards encouraging an economy that works for everybody.  Now, I want to make sure that this legislation helps employees at all income levels have access to ownership opportunities and that workers' retirement savings are not put in jeopardy by an overconcentration in company stock. That is why I offered an amendment requiring GAO to do a study on the impact of this legislation on employee participation and ownership and the effect this legislation has on securities held by retirement plans that are governed by  I very much look forward and am grateful that the rule has made in order my amendment. This study will give us important information on how these changes impacting employee ownership also affect retirement. It will give this body information that we need to move forward.  The example of my amendment is an example of the many great ideas that Democrats and Republicans could have brought forward had this been brought forward under an open rule. What better bill to bring forward under an open rule than this kind of bipartisan bill where there is nobody in this body who is trying to undermine or sabotage this bill?  There may be some Members who vote against it on both sides, I don't know, but the overwhelming majority are for it. I think there are Democrats and Republicans with great ideas who would love the opportunity to take 10 or 15 minutes--10 minutes as I am afforded under this rule. How many other Republicans and Democrats would love that same opportunity to offer amendments to improve this bill to make it even better?  The good news is employee ownership is not a partisan issue. Employee ownership strengthens our economy, helps small and medium-sized and large businesses across our entire economic spectrum create and retain jobs, and promotes an increased retirement savings for the middle class. These companies are often anchor businesses in our communities that go beyond offering jobs but are involved with sponsoring Little League or being involved with community nonprofits by giving back, by helping local charities and helping support an ecosystem of entrepreneurship by helping other entrepreneurs get off the ground through mentorship networks and angel funding networks.  I am a strong supporter of this bill and, of course, want to point out that it is simply a starting place. We have a long way to go with encouraging employee ownership in all of its forms--ESOPs, co-ops, stock options, outright stock grants--and any other ways that we can come up with or that the private sector can come up with that allow a stake in the company and in the value being created to reside with the employees, aligning their incentive, making our economy work for everybody, and ensuring that stakeholders have balanced benefits from our overall growth.  I support this bill. I wish it had been brought to the floor under an open rule. I oppose the rule.

8417,topic-id,484,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  You know, the beauty of an open rule, which we did see when the Democrats had the majority and we have not seen since the Republicans took the majority, is it allows the floor debate to inspire good ideas. It allows Democrats and Republicans to bring forward amendments, subject to germaneness, that can be considered and voted upon.  Frankly, it seems like the Republicans didn't have much for us to do this week. This would have been a perfect week to try an open rule; and I know that Democrats and Republicans would have, consistent with the spirit of an open rule, brought forth good ideas and offered them. Good ideas would have been included in the bill.  But most importantly, we could have set a precedent that open rules work and an open process that values our contributions as legislators and as representatives of 750,000 Americans who would be able to work to improve legislation. So I think that we need to move in that direction. Let the debate on the floor and the back-and-forth inspire new collaboration between Democrats and Republicans, new ideas, new ways of working together.  Here you have a concept that Democrats and Republicans join together in support of. How can we reduce the costs or the red tape around administering employee ownership? We would love to remove barriers to employee ownership that exist across all forms of employee ownership.  We would love to see an economy that works for everybody, one that values employees and workers as stakeholders that share in the economic growth that they helped create. That is a big part of the answer to the discrepancies in our economy and the simple fact--yes, fact--that the majority of the benefit of our economic growth has resided with a few and, generally, with shareholders and executives rather than workers.  So at the same time we can continue to move forward with conveying value to consumers, I think we can also find a way to make sure that workers are able to participate in the value that is created in our economy. But to be able to do so, we should have an open process that allows Democrats and Republicans to bring forward germane amendments that improve the bill, to create an even better and more comprehensive effort to encourage employee ownership.  Employee ownership ultimately touches a number of different committees. There are issues around employee ownership that affect government procurement. There are issues that would reside in the Ways and Means Committee under taxes. There are issues that reside in the Judiciary Committee, and, yes, Financial Services and regulator issues as well.  I am hopeful that Democrats and Republicans can work together to create a comprehensive omnibus approach to improving access to employee ownership for firms across our country.

8420,topic-id,612,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have had the opportunity to convene several roundtables in my district featuring employee-owned businesses, and it has been great to hear their stories, whether it is New Belgium Brewing, talking to employee owners who are excited to spend their time building value for themselves and creating stability in their own job and bringing a wonderful craft brew product to people in all the States in which they distribute, or medical care companies and so many others that have different variations of employee ownership.[[Page H2645]]  As a private sector entrepreneur before I came to Congress, I founded several companies in the technology sector. My companies used stock options for every employee, ranging from entry-level front desk and telephone all the way to executive positions; and, frankly, Mr.Speaker, that has become the standard in the tech industry.  So many venture-backed companies and technology companies provide stock options across the board such that people who participate in building that value are able to also participate in sharing the value that is created. That is one of the great aspects of the technology sector, in particular, and the startup sector that I hope can export to other sectors.  On the margins, this bill will make it a little bit easier for small and mid-sized companies to provide equity compensation to employees. But again, we need to do a lot more. We need to do a lot more culturally to make this the norm. We need to do a lot more from a tax perspective and from a regulatory perspective to make it easier for companies to share ownership with employees so that employees can benefit from the value that is being created.  It is considered the cultural norm and the best practice within the technology entrepreneurship sector, and I hope that that can carry across to other sectors as well. It is very important to have an economy that works for everybody, and employee ownership is a critical linchpin of that effort.  Mr.Speaker, we are debating on a rule and a bill that makes it easier for companies to offer employee stock as part of their compensation; but, unfortunately, the backdrop to this discussion is that there continues to be an enduring wage gap in which women are simply not paid the same as men for doing the same job. Any efforts by us to strengthen compensation packages continue to remain hollow for 51 percent of the country--women.  Today is Equal Pay I wish you, Mr.Speaker, a happy Equal Pay Day, and it is time that we do something to address pay and equity in our country.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative DeLauro's Paycheck Fairness Act in addition to the legislation we have been debating, H.1343. So what that means is I will still bring forward this legislation. I will just also bring forward the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I am a proud cosponsor of.  Sometimes when we move the previous question, we bring forward a piece of legislation in lieu of the legislation that we bring to the floor under the rule. In this case, once we defeat the previous question, I will offer both of those bills: this employee stock ownership bill and the bill to address paycheck inequity, the Paycheck Fairness  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

Opioid Epidemic  Mr.President, I rise today to talk about this issue of opioids--heroin, prescription drugs, now fentanyl--coming into our communities. It is at epidemic levels. We have worked on this issue over the last year in a bipartisan way and have made some progress. But I come today to the floor to report bad news and also to report something that Congress could do to help to address a new problem.  There was a report recently that came out by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission--very disturbing. It said that there is a new influx of what is called fentanyl coming in from This is a synthetic form of heroin. It can be up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Think about that.  The report says:       The majority of fentanyl products found in the United      States originate in Chinese law enforcement officials      have struggled to adequately regulate the thousands of      chemical and pharmaceutical facilities operating legally and      illegally in the country, leading to increased production and      export of illicit chemicals and drugs. Chinese chemical      exporters covertly ship these drugs to the Western       So that comes from an official report from this Commission on the United States and It is confirmed, unfortunately, back home. I was home this week meeting with law enforcement on They told me: Rob, the top issue in our community is now not heroin; it is fentanyl, and it is this synthetic form of heroin that is far more powerful.  At least in their minds, they think that it is also more effective at making people addicted because it is less expensive and the trafficking of it is more aggressive. So this is a big concern because we were finally, I thought, making some progress on the prescription drugs and the heroin, and now this fentanyl, Carfentanil, and U4--it goes by various names depending on the chemical compounds--are coming into our communities.  It is truly scary. The consequences are, I hope, obvious to everybody now. We are losing one American every 12 minutes. This speech will be about 12 minutes. We will lose another American to an overdose. But it is getting worse, not better. By the way, it is everywhere. Last year, in 2016, every single State in the Union had at least one forensic lab test positive for fentanyl.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of positive forensic tests for fentanyl in the United States doubled, in fact, from 2014 to 2015. We believe it is worse. We know it is worse than 2016 from the information we have. Unfortunately, even this year, this month and a half, we have seen more and more evidence of fentanyl coming into our communities.  According to the China Commission's report, the top destination for Chinese fentanyl, by the way, is my home State of We had more positive tests for fentanyl than any other By the way, Massachusetts--to my colleague who has been involved in this issue and worked on this issue and helped to try to stop the overprescribing of prescription drugs--was 2.  We are talking about 3,800 positive tests for fentanyl in Ohio alone. I do believe this is something that is being confirmed at the local level, not just from my meeting on Monday but from what I am hearing from around the Just 2 days after the Commission's report came out, in Butler County, OH, police seized $180,000 in fentanyl-laced heroin after suspected fentanyl overdoses killed five people in just 2 days.  Drug overdoses in Butler County, by the way, have nearly tripled since 2012. When I was in Dayton, I met with the Dayton R.A.N.G.E., which is a law enforcement task force--the Regional Agencies Narcotics and Gun Enforcement Task They told me that this is now their biggest problem.  They said, because it is stronger, there are more overdoses and more deaths than there are with a similar amount of heroin or the number of people using heroin. They said that just over a 2-week period, they had seized more than 40 pounds of drugs off the streets, including 6 pounds of fentanyl last week. Now, 6 pounds of fentanyl, as I do the math, is at least 20,000 doses--20,000 doses in 1 town in  I want to thank Montgomery County Sheriff Plummer, the task force, and[[Page S1249]]all of our law enforcement for their hard work to get this poison off the street. But they need our help. They need some additional tools. They told me about a 14-year-old girl who had tried fentanyl for the first time. She had never tried, apparently, any other drug. She snorted it. The people she was with had snorted drugs before, but she had not, which is one reason she not only overdosed but she died immediately. At 14 years old, her promising life was cut short.  It was in the Dayton suburb of Enon, a little more than a week ago, that a 5-year-old boy was seen running down the streets yelling: ``Mom and dad are dead. Mom and dad are dead.''  A driver saw the boy and called the police. They went to his house and found his parents. They weren't dead, fortunately, but they were unconscious. Mom was on the kitchen floor. Dad was on the living room floor. His skin had already turned blue, which is a sign of someone who overdoses and is close to death.  The first responders heroically saved both of them using Narcan--naloxone--this miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose. By the way, it took six doses of naloxone to revive the boy's father--a good sign, according to law enforcement, that this was not heroin but that it was heroin laced with fentanyl, something far stronger than the normal heroin--six doses.  We saw a 37-percent increase in drug overdose deaths last year in Dayton, OH, with victims as old as 87 and as young as 2 years old. Drug overdose deaths in Dayton are now on pace this year to be even more dramatic--54 deaths already in the last month and a half, which is more than any month and a half last year. Some 235 people have had their lives saved with naloxone. The Dayton Fire Department's call volume went up 17 percent compared to last January already.  So, again, it is not getting better. It is getting worse.  It is not just It is not just cities. This addiction knows no ZIP code. In suburbs, rural areas, and the inner city--it is everywhere, and, by the way, in all demographics. In Medina County, OH, in Northeast Ohio, their overdoses doubled from 2015 to 2016. In Darke County, OH, north of Dayton, a rural county, they are on pace to quadruple last year's number of drug overdoses already this year.  So why are these increases happening? One of the reasons is because of the increasing potency of these drugs on the street, particularly, again, this move from heroin to synthetic heroin that is more powerful.  Dayton paramedic David Gerstner puts it this way:       I don't want to say our overdose rate has increased      dramatically--because that doesn't even come close to      covering it . . . The potency of the drugs has increased to      the point that instead of patients needing 2 milligrams of      naloxone or 4 milligrams of naloxone or Narcan, we have had      patients who need 20 milligrams or more.  Again, it takes many, many doses of Narcan, also called naloxone, to be able to save these lives. In Darke County, which, again, is north of Dayton, Rescue Chief Brian Phillips said:       With the introduction of new illegally made synthetic      opiates [like] fentanyl and Carfentanil, heroin users are      overdosing at a more rapid rate. These derivatives are much      more potent and deadlier. The majority of our overdoses are      not breathing, and in some cases are in complete cardiac      arrest. We are also finding ourselves using more Narcan to      resuscitate these patients.  So this is the word from those who are in the trenches dealing with this every day. It is not good news. In just the first week of February, by the way, in his department in Darke County, OH, they had 12 overdose calls--in the first week of This is a town of 13,000 people.  So it is clear that these drugs are getting on the street, and they are stronger, more addictive, and more dangerous. Heroin is already addictive enough and relatively inexpensive compared to prescription drugs, which is why many people move from prescription drugs to heroin. Probably four out of five heroin addicts in Ohio started with prescription drugs, according to the experts.  But now it is being laced, this more powerful synthetic drug. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation tested 34 cases of fentanyl in 2010. In 2015, they tested 1,100--a thirtyfold increase. Last year that number doubled again to 2,400 cases. Again, they have already tested for a record breaking number this year in the last month and a half.  According to the Ohio Substance Abuse Monitoring Network, you can buy small doses of heroin and fentanyl for as little as $5 to $10 now in Southwest A lot parents and family members of those struggling with addiction worried about this, and it is very easy to see why. As the coroner in Butler County said:       Buying heroin today is like playing Russian roulette . . .      people don't know what's in the product they're going to use,      and it may not be the same [from] one use to the next.  The coroner in my home town of Cincinnati, Lakshmi Sammarco, put it like this. You buy heroin, and ``you may be gambling with your life'' because it is more dangerous than ever.  We have to get that message out there. We have not done a good job of communicating this basic message that you are gambling with your life.  Richard Marsh, Clark County coroner, says:       We're seeing a lot more fentanyl than heroin now. It      started about the middle of 2015 . . . there are all kinds of      labs producing it now and a lot of people think they're      buying heroin when in fact they're getting fentanyl, which is      fifty times as powerful.  How powerful is that? Let me give you an example. According to the DEA, or the Drug Enforcement Administration, it takes only 2 milligrams of fentanyl, about the same as a pinch of salt--think about that--to kill you. That is how powerful it is.  So again, going back to this China Commission report, they say most of these synthetic drugs are being made in labs in China and being shipped to the Western Hemisphere--to our country, to our communities.  How is it coming in? People are surprised to learn that it is coming in through the mail system. These deadly poisons are coming in through the mail system.  So unlike heroin, which primarily goes over land, primarily from Mexico, these drugs are actually coming in from Asia, from China and India, through the mail system. Unlike the private mail carriers, such as UPS or FedEx, our mail system does not require that people say where the package is coming from, what is in it, or where it is going. I think people are kind of surprised to hear that too.  That, of course, makes it is easier for the traffickers and much harder for our law enforcement to be able to deal with this problem. They cannot scan these packages that are suspect for drugs like fentanyl or other smuggled products because there are just too many packages--millions of packages. But if they had that information, if that was required on every package--electronically, in advance, digitally; this data, where it is coming from, what is in it, where it is going--our law enforcement officials tell us they would have a better shot at being able to stop this poison and being able to identify those packages.  I applaud my colleagues because with the Cures Act last year--it passed at the end of last year--we provided much more funding to our communities, to our Half a billion--$500 million--is going out to our States to be able to deal with the issue of drug treatment and recovery services. It is very important.  That $500 million, by the way, is this year and next year. That is really important to fight the epidemic. I also, of course, applaud my colleagues with regard to the legislation called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery This provides us with not just more funding but better practices with regard to prevention, education, treatment and recovery, and providing the police with Narcan training and providing more Narcan resources to our first responders, whom we talked about.  So again, in the last year, Congress has taken some important steps forward. I commend the House and Senate for that. By the way, it was bipartisan from the start. I think that is beginning to make a difference. I wish the programs in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act could be implemented more quickly.  Unfortunately, there are still five more CARA grant programs that have yet to be implemented. Many of us pushed the last administration. Now we are pushing this administration to move quickly on that because this crisis is out there in our communities[[Page S1250]]now. We need the help. But we are getting that in place, and that is important.  But we now need to build on those efforts because of this synthetic heroin that is coming in. An obvious step to me would be to simply say that the Postal Service has to require what the private carriers require so these traffickers are not favoring the Postal Service and so we can begin to stop some of these dangerous synthetic drugs from coming into our communities, but also so that we can give law enforcement a tool to be able to target this and so that, at a minimum, we can increase the cost of this poison coming into our communities. It seems common sense to me.  Last week, Senators Klobuchar, Hassan, Rubio, and I introduced legislation called the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or STOP Act, to simply close the loophole and require the Postal Service to obtain advance electronic data on packages before they cross our borders. We just introduced it 2 days ago. It simply closes the loophole and requires the Postal Service to obtain advanced electronic data along the lines I talked about: where it is from, what is in it, where it is going.  In the House, by the way, there is companion legislation, which makes it easier to get this done because the House also understands this problem. My colleague, Congressman Pat Tiberi from Ohio, is one of the people who are focused on this issue. He is one of the cosponsors. The other cosponsor is from Massachusetts, Richie Their companion legislation will make it easier for us to get this job done.  This bill is totally bipartisan--in fact, I would call it nonpartisan. It is based on expert testimony we had before our Homeland Security Committee, where we heard directly from law enforcement. It is a simple change that would make it much easier for them to detect these packages, particularly those from these Chinese labs that the China Commission report talked about.  It is not a silver bullet. No one has that silver bullet. But our bill will take away a key tool of drug traffickers and help restrict the supply of these drugs, this poison in our community, making their price higher and making it harder to get.  With the threat of synthetic heroin growing worse and worse every day, there is an urgency to this, so today I urge my colleagues to join us in this legislation. Cosponsor it. Let's get this through the committees.  The Finance Committee will be taking up this legislation. I am on that committee. I hope we move very quickly to mark it up, get it to the floor, pass the legislation here in the Senate, combine it with the legislation that is working through the House, get it to the President's desk for signature, and begin to provide some relief to our communities from this influx of synthetic heroin that is continuing to tear our families apart, devastate our communities, and ruin lives.  This is about ensuring that young people, like the young people who are with us today, the pages on the floor, have the opportunity to pursue their dream, whatever it is. This is about ensuring that we are stepping up as a Congress to deal with a global problem. It is coming in from overseas. It is an international problem. Certainly this is one where the Congress ought to act to ensure that our U.Postal Service does the right thing to help law enforcement be able to better protect our communities.  I yield the floor.

8519,topic-id,1153,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection President Trump has made it clear that he wants to savage environmental protections, and his administration has already started down this path of reversing some of our hard-fought progress to ensure we have a clean environment: clean water and fresh air. By nominating Mr.Pruitt, President Trump has chosen someone equally hostile to the very notion of defending our environment and our Nation's health.  Respected voices on both sides of the aisle have expressed similar alarm over Mr.Pruitt's nomination. President George Bush's former EPA Administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, who led the Agency from 2001 to 2003, stated in reference to Mr.Pruitt: ``I don't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the Agency and the science behind what the Agency does.''  This is a sentiment I have heard from over a thousand Rhode Islanders--environmentalists, researchers, conservationists, community leaders, parents, concerned citizens--who agree that Mr.Pruitt is a troubling choice for this role. They have contacted my office to express how distressed they are that someone with Mr.Pruitt's record and background could be chosen to lead the  Last week I hosted a roundtable to hear these concerns directly from my constituents. These Rhode Islanders shared their worries about the state of our changing environment, anxiousness about Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and concerns over what they have seen so far, and fear is coming with respect to the Trump administration's approach to our environment. Nevertheless, they remain committed to ensuring that we have clean air and clean water because these natural resources are so important to our economy, our health, and our quality of life.  I share that commitment. I have consistently voted for strong environmental policies that seek to limit pollution, promote renewable energy, and mitigate the effects of climate change.  The EPA oversees the Federal Government's role in protecting our health and environment. It needs a leader who fundamentally believes in its core mission. Scott Pruitt has a record of working against the Agency's goals to protect Americans from pollution. That is the goal of the He does not believe or respect the scientific findings regarding climate change, and his close ties to the oil and gas industry are a serious concern.  These kinds of beliefs and views should be of concern to everyone in this  As Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt sued the EPA multiple times seeking to eliminate pollution regulations. He has a record of not only challenging the legal, scientific, and technical foundations of EPA rules, but he has also questioned the EPA's authority to issue them.  Mr.Pruitt filed as the plaintiff in these lawsuits, many of which are still pending. If confirmed as the EPA Administrator, he would be switching sides to become the defendant in these lawsuits. And yet, he has refused to recuse himself from any of these or related cases. He has also failed to provide records of his communications with fossil fuel companies during the years he served as attorney general.  It is abundantly clear that he cannot be impartial.  This lack of transparency regarding Mr.Pruitt's connections to the oil and gas industry raises serious questions about what influence these conflicts will have on his ability to enforce regulations that protect everyday Americans from pollution generated by fossil fuel use.  The EPA Administrator must be someone who will uphold and enforce Federal environmental laws impartially and honorably, with Americans' health in mind.  One issue in particular that comes to mind is one I have worked on for decades across multiple Federal agencies--lead poisoning prevention. I have long advocated for better Federal policies and more funding to protect children from lead hazards. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do much of this work, the EPA plays an important role as well.  I think we saw that very clearly over the last year with the situation in Flint,  I was deeply concerned that when asked about lead poisoning among children during his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt told the committee that he, in his own words, ``really wasn't familiar with the basic science surrounding[[Page S1251]]the health effects of lead poisoning.'' For the sake of his education on this issue--and to make all my colleagues who might not be aware of the impact--lead poisoning in children can cause serious and irreversible developmental and health problems.  We need an EPA Administrator who is familiar with and committed to protecting the health of our children from these and other kinds of environmental health hazards. Unfortunately, I do not believe Mr.Pruitt is qualified to do so.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt also displayed a lack of understanding of the role human activity plays in climate change, as well as a disregard for the scientists who have spent their lives studying and carefully observing our Earth's changing climate.  Our next EPA Administrator should understand the threat of climate change and base the Agency's policies on scientific data and findings without ideological influence. Many people across the Nation were distressed and deeply concerned by the removal of climate change reports from the EPA's website shortly after President Trump took office. I share that concern, and I am disturbed that the EPA has recently put a hold on issuing new grants and instituted a gag order on all communications.  This is alarming. The halting of Federal funds means that our investments in our water infrastructure, remediation of our watersheds, and support for numerous others environmental initiatives so vital to our local communities and States will be affected, and this will seriously harm environmental protection efforts. In Rhode Island, these cuts could have devastating effects, such as hindering the State's ability to provide clean air and clean drinking water for all residents.  We need an EPA Administrator who is committed to safeguarding clean water and clean air and who is experienced in environmental protection. This role demands someone who is prepared to preserve and defend our environment from harm, who can make decisions based on scientific evidence, and whose financial ties will not impact his decisions when it comes to protecting the American public from pollution.  Scott Pruitt is not the EPA Administrator we need. The nature of the lawsuits he filed attempting to dismantle EPA regulations that protect clean air and water--the very regulations he would be charged with enforcing--demonstrates that he is not committed to defending our natural resources, our health, and our well-being. Mr.Pruitt, in my estimate, is unsuited and unqualified for this critical leadership position.  For these reasons, I cannot support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.  Mr.President, I respectfully ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to yield the remainder of my time on this nomination to my colleague, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

General Pruitt is a strong believer in federalism and States' rights, which have been often overlooked by the previous administration, often to the detriment of the U.economy and our environment.  I am hopeful Attorney General Pruitt will take steps to improve the Federal regulatory process to make certain Federal regulations are promulgated with adequate public participation, underpinned by the best scientific evidence available and in a transparent and open manner. Attorney General Pruitt understands the importance of taking stakeholder, State, and local government comments and expertise into account when promulgating regulations. He understands that listening to and considering the differing viewpoints of stakeholders will improve the regulatory process and lead to better regulations. This will lead to fewer burdensome and costly regulations for South Dakota farmers, ranchers, and landowners, while at the same time making certain we have clean air and clean water.

He saw how incomplete economic analysis did not account for the full impact of regulations on U.citizens, and the regulatory burden was often far greater than what the EPA claimed it would be.  The attorney general can modernize the EPA's approach to regulation and make certain that regulations are promulgated in a deliberate, fair, and[[Page S1240]]transparent process. A better regulatory process will lead to better regulations. Better regulations will make certain our air, water, and land is protected, our economy continues to grow, and American jobs can continue to be created.

But they had done nothing wrong; their crime was being Japanese, German, or They were labeled ``enemy aliens.''  Mark Twain reportedly said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme, and this seems to be the path the President has pursued with his Muslim ban. This ban has already harmed green card holders, students, business people, and those fleeing violence and persecution. Remember, these are the people fleeing the violence, not the perpetrators of the violence. They are the victims, not the criminals. They have been pulled from their flights, left stranded in the airports. They have been detained without the ability to talk with a lawyer. And they are wondering if the United States of America is still the beacon of hope, the lamp by the golden door, the shining city on the hill.

First, zero people from the countries on the ban list have been involved in terrorist attacks in Zero people from the countries on the ban list have been involved in terrorist attacks on It is almost as though the criteria for picking the countries is something other than the threat of terrorism.  Second, this ban has the potential to strengthen violent extremist groups by playing right into their hands. It encourages everyone to be afraid of people we don't know from other places. That is not America, and it will not work.  When President Gerald Ford repealed the Executive order interning Japanese Americans, he asked citizens across the country to make a pledge. He said: ``I call upon the American people to affirm with me this American promise--that we have learned from the tragedy of that long-ago experience forever to treasure liberty and justice for each individual American, and resolve that this kind of action shall never again be repeated.''  That promise is being broken. It is broken for the American who came to this country as a lost boy from Sudan and who now cannot see his family. It is broken for the American married to an Iranian, whom the government is splitting from her husband. It is broken for the millions of Americans, the majority of us, who want us always to have the moral high ground.  The world is watching. History is watching. We have to ask ourselves: What do they see? Do they see Lady Liberty or do they see something darker? The choice is ours. We can fix this.  We start by following the wise words of Fred Korematsu, an outspoken voice against Japanese internment and an American hero who was born 98 years ago today.

8611,topic-id,1342,"Mr.President, last night the Republicans in the House revealed their plan to scrap the ACA and replace it with something much worse--There are so many things that are wrong with this bill. A lot of us are still going through the 184 pages and all of its implications, so it is impossible to encapsulate all the difficulties in this legislation in one speech.  I am going to highlight eight problems with this bill to start. First of all, this bill is a complicated and rushed mess. Despite the fact that they had 7 years to work on their own plan, the Republicans cobbled together a bill that makes no sense. In an effort to make everyone in their caucus happy, they have made no one in their caucus happy. That is why we have seen conservative groups--from AEI to AFP, the Heritage Foundation, the Koch brothers--come out and express opposition to the legislation.  Second, this bill cuts They are going to use a phrase called block grants, but I want everyone to understand that is cutting That is a euphemism for cutting the resources for This cuts a program that helps more than 70 million Americans across the country get the healthcare they need. It means less care for pregnant moms, less care for families with loved ones in nursing homes. Nursing home benefits will be totally trashed, and all of these changes will reduce Medicaid to a level not seen before.  By the way, Medicare doesn't escape the ax. It is also in trouble if we enact the House legislation. TrumpCare will actually move up the date of insolvency of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years, to the year 2025. That is not 20, 30 years from now when they talk about the Social Security trust fund. That is quite soon to have Medicare be insolvent, and they are accelerating the date in which Medicare becomes insolvent.  Third, this bill hits the elderly with an age tax. Here is how the law currently works. It is basically a cap on the amount that an insurance company can charge a senior for healthcare. It says you cannot charge more than three times the amount you charge a young person for a senior citizen.  It is capped at three times what you charge for young people. This would increase the cap to five times the cost. If a young person's health insurance costs $250, the maximum under the current law is $750. Now you are talking five times $250--$1,250 per month.  This is an age tax. If there is any doubt about how difficult this is going to be for senior citizens, ask the They are a bipartisan, well-respected organization that works in every Seniors across the country need to understand what this age tax is. You will pay more for health insurance if the law passes as it is.  Fourth, and this is a very important point. This is basically not a healthcare bill because if it were a healthcare bill, everybody knows it would require 60 votes. It would be enacting new legislation. This is a budget bill. All they can do, really, is cut taxes related to healthcare. This is a bill that cuts taxes for rich people.  How does it finance it? First of all, it finances--probably a lot of it by borrowing. The other portion of it is by cuts to Medicare and TrumpCare has special tax cuts that only benefit the highest earning households and another one that will go to insurance company executives who make more than half a million dollars a year.  You cannot make this stuff up. They are cutting taxes for insurance company executives who make more than half a million dollars each year, and they are financing it by cutting healthcare for the people we all represent.  Fifth, this bill will blow up the debt and the deficit. The crazy thing is, we don't actually know how much our debt and deficit will increase because Republicans are in such a hurry to rush this through without a formal CBO analysis. We have no idea how much this is going to cost--probably trillions, but they haven't even asked for a CBO score. They don't want to know how much this is going to blow up the debt and the deficit because all of the fiscal hawks will be found to be hypocrites who have been railing about deficits for all of their career. Yet this might be the biggest budget-busting piece of legislation in many, many years, and they don't want to know how much it costs because they have made a promise. They are going to go ahead and fulfill that promise no matter how ridiculous it is.  Sixth, this bill will trash mental health coverage. The ACA was a huge step forward for the mental health community because it required insurance companies to cover mental health and substance abuse disorders. We are in a moment when every State is struggling with an addiction crisis. What I don't know is why we would rip away these services when so many people are counting on it to break their addictions.  Seventh, this bill will defund Planned Parenthood because they can't help themselves in the U.House of Planned Parenthood is a provider that offers healthcare to millions of women across the country, but this bill will stop low-income women from getting critical health services like breast cancer screenings from local clinics. Oftentimes, this would happen in communities where women have nowhere else to turn. Many community health centers don't have the services women need or they have twice the wait times that a Planned Parenthood would have. For women waiting to find out if they have cancer, that is simply not an option.  Finally, this bill is too partisan. I think we can all agree that our approach to healthcare could use some improvements, and I am more than ready to work with my Republican colleagues to make healthcare better. That is not just a rhetorical flourish. I have tried to back that up with my legislative actions. I have worked with Senator Hatch on legislation to increase access to high-quality care in hard-to-reach regions. I have worked with Senator Cassidy and many others on a bill to create a public health emergency fund. I have worked with Senators Wicker, Cochran, and Thune on a telehealth bill.  We can work together on healthcare, but it requires three things: 1, good faith, and there is no good faith in this piece of legislation. 2, bipartisanship. This bill, I am quite sure, will get zero Democratic votes in the House or the 3, we need legislative hearings. We need to have a conversation in the light of day and let the American people weigh in. We need to figure out what it is that they are doing to the American healthcare system.  If they are so proud of their plan, why no hearings? If they are so proud of their plan, why not get at least a score from the Congressional Budget Office? If they are so proud of their plan, why do they lack the confidence that any Democrat will support it?  Look, we do have the opportunity to work together to improve healthcare, but this bill is basically a mess. It is worse than I thought. I think it is worse than a lot of people thought, especially given that they have been talking about this for 7 years. So one might think they would have had a really well-thought-through plan. This has all of the characteristics of something that was rushed out the door in about a 48-hour period.  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this very bad piece of legislation and give us some space and time to do this right and to do this in a bipartisan fashion.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

8514,topic-id,1996,"Mr.President, I came to the floor today to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection I thank my colleague from Delaware, whom I had the honor to serve with when we were both Governors, for his good work to point out why Scott Pruitt is the wrong person to head the Environmental Protection  The EPA was created by a Republican President in 1970, Richard I remember very clearly when he did that. Across subsequent decades, support for this Agency and for its important mission has been a strongly bipartisan endeavor. Our Nation has benefited from the service of dedicated, highly effective EPA Administrators from both parties, but I am deeply concerned that Scott Pruitt is a radical break from this bipartisan tradition.  After reviewing Mr.Pruitt's environmental record, I have to ask: Why was he nominated for this critically important position? He rejects the core missions of the Environmental Protection Agency at every turn. He has sued the EPA to block protections for clean air and clean water; he is an outspoken climate change denier; he seeks to dismantle the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which was put in place to address climate change; and he opposes other efforts to slow the warming of this planet. Time and again, he has put private interests and their profits ahead of public interests and public health.[[Page S1245]]  As attorney general of Oklahoma, he has sided with oil and gas companies, and he has failed to protect the people of his State from some of the worst impacts of hydraulic fracturing. He has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from fossil fuel industries, and he zealously advocated for their freedom to pollute our air and water.  So again I ask: Why was Scott Pruitt nominated to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? Well, I think it is clear Mr.Pruitt was nominated not to lead the EPA forward but to prevent it from carrying out its mission. Make no mistake, Mr.Pruitt and his extreme agenda are a threat to the environment, to the planet, and to our public health.  Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican Governor of New Jersey and whom I also had the honor of serving with when I was Governor--Senator Carper, Christie Whitman, and I all served as Governors together. She also was EPA Administrator during George Bush's administration. What she said about Pruitt I think is worth listening to. This is a Republican talking about Scott Pruitt: ``I don't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.''  People in the State of New Hampshire have no doubt about the reality of climate change. In the Granite State we see it. We experience it all the time. The steady increase in yearly temperatures and the rise in annual precipitation are already affecting New Hampshire's tourism and our outdoor recreation economy, which accounts for more than $4 billion a year and employs over 50,000 people. Each year, hundreds of thousands of sportsmen and wildlife watchers come to New Hampshire to enjoy our beautiful mountains, our lakes, our other natural resources, and our 18 miles of coastline, which we are very proud of. As I said, hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation contribute more than $4 billion to New Hampshire's economy each year, but much of this is now threatened by the warming of our planet. Rising temperatures are shortening our fall foliage season, they are negatively affecting our snow- and ice-related winter recreation activities, including skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling. An estimated 17,000 Granite Staters are directly employed by the ski industry in New Hampshire, and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services warns that those jobs are threatened by climate change.  Likewise, New Hampshire's and indeed all of New England's brilliant fall foliage is at risk. I wish to quote from a report by New Hampshire Citizens for Responsible Energy They say: ``Current modeling forecasts predict that maple sugar trees eventually will be completely eliminated as a regionally important species in the northeastern United States.''  Climate modeling by the Union of Concerned Scientists projects that by the end of this century, New Hampshire summers will feel like present-day summers in North Carolina, 700 miles to our south. We have a map that shows what is going to happen to our red maples and the maple sugaring industry. We can see everything here that is in red, these are all those sugar maples. It is projected that by 2070 or 2100, they are gone. They are gone from New England, from the Northeast, and from most of the Eastern part of this country. If we fail to act on climate change, this could mean a steep loss of jobs. It could mean a loss of revenue. It will destroy our maple sugaring industry and will damage our outdoor recreation industry.  Maple sugar production is entirely dependent on weather conditions, and changes--no matter how modest--can throw off production and endanger this industry. Maple trees require warm days and freezing nights to create the optimal sugar content in sap production. The changing climate is putting more and more stress on sugar maples. As this map shows so well, it is already significantly affecting syrup production. If we fail to act on climate change, this could destroy our maple syrup industry. If you haven't done maple sugaring in the springtime, there is nothing like maple syrup over snow. There is nothing else like it. To lose that and to lose the jobs that are there is a real change to one of the recreational activities we love in New  Climate change is also threatening our wildlife species and their habitats. The moose is an iconic feature of New Hampshire's culture and identity, but as the results of climate change, we have seen a 40-percent decline in New Hampshire's moose population. We can see clearly from these pictures why we are losing our moose: Because of milder winters, ticks don't die off. It is really very tragic. The ticks multiply on a moose, they ravage it, and they eventually kill it. I don't know if people can see, but what look like little balls on the end of that moose's tail are ticks. This moose probably has brain worm, which is another problem the moose have because of winters that aren't cold enough to kill off those parasites. Ticks multiply on a moose, they ravage it, and they eventually kill it.  We have seen modeling from the University of New Hampshire which suggests that by 2030, moose will be gone--not only from northern New Hampshire but from much of the northern part of this country.  Other newly invasive insects are harming wildlife species as well as trees. Of course, people are also suffering from the impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures increase the number of air pollution action days. They increase pollen and mold levels, outdoors as well as allergen levels inside, and all of these things are dangerous to sensitive populations with asthma, allergies, and chronic respiratory conditions. In fact, New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country because we are the tailpipe. All of New England is the tailpipe for the rest of the country. Pollution blows across this country from the Midwest and exits through New Hampshire and New  Rising temperatures facilitate the spread of insect-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease. We could see on that moose what the impact is. Those ticks aren't just multiplying on the moose, they are multiplying in a way that affects people as well.  Fortunately, because we have seen the impact of climate change, New Hampshire and the other New England States are taking the lead in reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a more energy-efficient, clean energy economy. We are one of nine Northeastern States participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative called It is essentially a cap-and-trade system in the New Hampshire has already reduced its power sector carbon pollution by 49 percent since 2008. That is a 49-percent reduction in less than a decade. Thanks to efforts by State and local communities, New Hampshire is on track to meet the Clean Power Plan's carbon reduction goals 10 years early. In addition, we are using proceeds from emissions permits sold at RGGI auctions to finance clean energy and energy efficiency investments.  Unfortunately, Scott Pruitt seems to believe that reducing pollution and investing in a clean environment are somehow bad for the economy. He is just wrong about that. Our efforts in New Hampshire and across New England to fight climate change and promote clean energy have been a major boost to economic growth. We have seen jobs added as a result. During its first 3 years, RGGI produced $1.6 billion in net economic value and created more than 16,000 jobs in our region. Nationwide, employment in the fossil fuel sector is falling dramatically, but job creation in the clean energy and energy efficiency sectors is exploding. According to the U.Department of Energy, more than 2 million jobs have been created in the energy efficiency sector alone and--if we can ever get Congress to move the energy efficiency legislation Senator Portman and I have introduced--would create, by 2030, another 200,000 jobs, just on energy efficiency. Across New England, we are demonstrating that smart energy choices can benefit the environment and strengthen job creation and the economy overall.  So, again, we have to ask: Why does Scott Pruitt deny the science of climate change? Why has he urged States to refuse to comply with the Clean Power Plan? Why has he filed lawsuit after lawsuit to block enforcement of the Clean Air Act? Why does he deny[[Page S1246]]something as nearly universally recognized as the dangers of mercury pollution?  The bottom line, I believe, is that Scott Pruitt is first and foremost a fierce defender of the oil and gas industry. If scientists point to carbon emissions as the main cause of climate change, then he has to deny that science. If science and common sense point to hydraulic fracking as the cause of thousands of earthquakes in the State of Oklahoma, then he must deny that too. If the EPA's mission is to protect clean air and clean water from pollution caused by fossil fuels, then he has to sue the EPA and try to cripple it.  Scott Pruitt's nomination is not about shaking things up in It is about turning over control of the EPA to the fossil fuel industry and turning back the clock on half a century of bipartisan efforts--in Democratic and Republican administrations alike--to protect clean air and clean water and to pass on to our children a livable environment and an Earth that they can inhabit from future generations.  My office has been flooded with calls, emails, and letters from Granite They not only oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination, they are genuinely afraid of the consequences of putting him in charge of the  I heard from Deb Smith from Hampton, That is a small community on our coastline. She wrote:       I am a birder, love to walk on the beach and in the      mountains, and rely on time spent in nature to cope with a      [stage four] lung cancer diagnosis. Clean air is especially      important to me! Pruitt's long history of suing the EPA and      reversing decades of progress in improving the environment      disqualifies him for this post. It is essential to continue      to preserve and improve our natural environment for people,      birds, and other wildlife!  Elizabeth Garlo of Concord writes:       New Hampshire, due to quirks in its geology and the Earth's      rotation, is the ``tailpipe'' of the Nation with much of the      air pollutants from the Midwest exiting to the ocean from      here.

8372,topic-id,197,"Mr.Speaker, this is a simple issue: Do we want to make workplaces safer? Do we want to keep workers from getting hurt on the job? Of course, we do.  In order to protect workers, we need good data on where injuries are happening so we can work with employers to stop them.  Sometimes the other side says commonsense protections like this are too expensive or they kill jobs or they stifle innovation. None of those is even remotely true here.  The protections this resolution would take away cost nothing. Responsible employers are already keeping these records.

8494,topic-id,1164,"Mr.President, let me say first that I join with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia in expressing concern about our water infrastructure and water issues. As many of us know, we have had terrific challenges in Flint, MI, with an entire water system being unable to be used because of lead poisoning and the terrible decisions made, primarily at the State level.  I was very concerned--when I speak about Mr.Pruitt and his nomination--that when asked by Senator Cardin if he believes there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body, particularly a young person, he said that this is something he hasn't reviewed and doesn't know anything about. That is deeply concerning to me--that the person who would be heading the EPA would not know anything about lead poisoning and what that means, first of all, in a child's body, where it is poisoned and affects their development throughout their life. It is critically important for us in Michigan--and there are many, many places where there are serious water quality issues that need to be addressed--that we have someone who understands the science and the need for clean water rules and protecting our waters so that any family, any community can have the confidence of turning on the faucet and knowing that there is going to be clean water coming out into their sink in their home. It is very concerning to me that we have a nominee who indicated that he really didn't know anything about this issue.  So for that and a number of reasons--many, many reasons--I am joining with so many colleagues in opposing Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection  The EPA Administrator is a very important position. As I indicated, to those of us in Michigan, surrounded by the beauty of the Great Lakes, having the responsibility for protecting the Great Lakes, this is a very, very important position.  After examining Mr.Pruitt's record on a broad range of issues, as well as[[Page S1236]]his views about the Agency he has been nominated to lead, I have significant concerns about the direction and the priorities the EPA would take if he becomes  Now, this is not based on partisan politics. When George Bush was President, I joined 98 of my colleagues to vote to confirm Christie Todd Whitman to be EPA Two years later, I was among 87 other Members of the Senate to vote to confirm Michael Leavitt to succeed her at the  But the facts are--the evidence is--that Scott Pruitt does not have the requisite experience and track record to successfully lead an Agency that plays such a critical role in protecting the health and the well-being of the American people, and, certainly, the people that I represent in the great State of  As I mentioned before, we are very, very familiar with the importance of clean water and the consequences of environmental mismanagement. We need an EPA that will act quickly when there is a crisis like the one that happened in Flint, which is, unfortunately, still going on. This was a manmade crisis inflicted by the State of Michigan's actions on a number of different levels that created a situation where the State would rather save $100 a day than treat the water for lead corrosion. So $100 a day they wanted to save rather than treat the water to prevent children and families from being exposed to lead-tainted water. This was a State decision.  Mr.Pruitt has made it clear that it is his intention to defer as much as possible to States--to States like Michigan, which didn't treat the water, then didn't tell the truth, then covered it up, and still has not done--despite Congress and the President together acting to support that community, the State still has not stepped up to meet their responsibilities. After more than 2 years, people still cannot turn on the faucet and have confidence that they are going to have clean water. Yet Mr.Pruitt says the State ought to be the one making these decisions.  While I firmly believe an effective EPA is one that works closely and often in concert with State and local communities, we must also be sure we have leadership at the EPA that is willing and capable of providing the oversight necessary to ensure environmental and public health standards.  We also need an EPA Administrator whom we can trust to protect and preserve our amazing Great Critical to this objective is a grant program administered by the EPA called Great Lakes Restoration I was very pleased to champion and help launch this in 2010 with strong support from the Obama administration. This accelerates efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes by providing grants to clean up contaminated areas; prevent and control invasive species, things like Asian carp, which we are constantly having to focus on to push back these fish from destroying our fisheries and boating operations and environments in the Great Lakes; to address harmful algae blooms and restore habitat; and to protect native species.  Scott Pruitt's long record of opposing nearly all Federal environmental programs raises serious questions to me about his commitment to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and all of the efforts we have worked on in a bipartisan, bicameral way to make sure we are protecting 20 percent of the world's freshwater, 30 million people's drinking water, and a huge economic engine called the Great  I always like to say the Great Lakes are in our DNA, and that is very true for all of us who live in Michigan and certainly around the Great Lakes because we understand that this great natural resource supports more than 1.5 million jobs and nearly $62 billion in wages tied to jobs and industries, and, frankly, it reflects our wonderful quality of life in  I also have great concerns about Mr.Pruitt's long-running opposition to the landmark renewable fuel standard, which puts him at odds with the Agency that administers the program. The President promised us a farmer-friendly Yet this nominee to lead the Agency wants to dismantle one of the most successful economic drivers in rural Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly spoken out against the renewable fuel standard, calling the program flawed and unworkable.  Mr.Pruitt heading up EPA, coupled with former ExxonMobil executive Rex Tillerson at the State Department and oil refinery owner Carl Icahn advising the White House, may well be the end of the RFS as we know it. That is, frankly, bad news for biofuels producers in Michigan, bad news for Americans who care about creating economic growth and jobs in rural communities, and bad news for small towns and communities throughout Mr.Pruitt's record of siding with polluters over sound science puts him outside the mainstream of what we should expect from our EPA  It is for these reasons that I intend to vote against his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

8608,topic-id,2370,"Mr.President, I want to speak about the healthcare bill that has been laid out in the House now--introduced in the House of I have great concern about the proposal as it relates to the people of Michigan, whom I represent, as well as to the people across the country. This proposal--or whatever passes--will be judged based on whether or not people pay more for their coverage, if they can find it, and whether they are going to be able to get the healthcare they need.  Healthcare is very personal. Despite the politics here in Congress and in the White House, healthcare is not political; it is very personal. Can you go to a doctor? Can you take your child to a doctor? Can your parents or grandparents get the nursing home care they need? Are you going to be able to find insurance after you have had a heart attack or cancer or if your child has juvenile diabetes and, therefore, has a preexisting condition?  I am deeply concerned after the initial look I have had, and we will continue to look at more and more of the details as they come out. This proposal is going to create chaos in the healthcare system. Frankly, I would say this is a mess. It is going to create a big mess as it relates to the families whom I represent and whom we all represent in our home  This was written in secret. We have all seen the stories of the Senator from the other side of the aisle who was running around trying to get a copy of what was going on. Everything was done in secret, and now that it is out, we find out that there is no cost attached to it. We do not know what the overall cost will be to taxpayers. We also do not know how many people are going to be able to get healthcare, who is going to be able to be covered.  What I have seen really falls in the category of creating a mess for families--higher costs for middle-class families, higher costs for poor families, but less coverage--such a deal. This is not the kind of deal that the people of Michigan want to have for themselves and their families.  To add insult to injury, it cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans, while it makes most Americans pay more. It makes seniors pay more, and we have heard people calling it the ``age tax'' or the ``senior tax.'' The reality is, in a number of different ways, in how we rate, which is based on age and other costs, seniors will pay more. It is my understanding that, in the middle of this, there is actually a sweetheart deal for the CEOs of big insurance companies that will give them pay raises. This whole thing is stunning to me, which is being put forward with a straight face.  On top of everything else, it removes the guarantee for preexisting conditions. It is very unclear what will happen to someone who has had a heart attack. I have a new, little, baby grandniece who has had two heart surgeries already, and there is another one that she will have to have in another year. While she is doing great--and my niece and nephew deserve incredible admiration for taking care of little Leighton--she is going to have a preexisting condition her whole life. She is going to have a reconstructed heart that is going to cause her various challenges. Without the current guarantees that we have that she gets with her insurance, her folks are going to have a hard[[Page S1618]]time, and little Leighton is going to have a hard time her whole life.  When we look a little bit more into the details of all of this, we see, in fact, that this bill provides tax increases for millions of families. It repeals the tax credits in 2020 that help working families afford insurance. By the way, even though things do not happen immediately, in their knowing it is coming, the insurance companies are certainly going to find themselves making different kinds of decisions, and, certainly, families will make different kinds of decisions. I would expect the insurance system to be destabilized immediately. We are already seeing problems with insurance companies pulling out just based on the debate about repealing healthcare.  When we look at the tax credits--or help--for buying healthcare, it goes from helping those from low-, moderate-, and middle-income families being able to afford insurance to changing the whole thing. It is based on your age and your income. So the higher the age and the higher the income, the more taxpayer dollars you get, which makes no sense. A 55-year-old with a higher income will get more taxpayer funding than will a 30-year-old who is working a minimum wage job and has the toughest time in trying to find insurance that he can afford. This is not the set of values or perspectives that make sense for people in Michigan, as well as for people across the country.  While that 30-year-old who is working a minimum wage job is going to be paying more and hoping that he does not have a preexisting condition because he may not be able to find insurance at all, we see that there is a $300 billion--with a ``b''--tax cut for the wealthiest Picture this: Somebody in a minimum wage job who could very well see his health insurance go completely away will have that happen, while someone who makes more than $3.7 million a year will save over $200,000 a year. So $200,000 a year is what he will get back now in the form of a tax cut, which is more than what most people make. Certainly, the majority of people in Michigan make less. They work very, very hard, but they make less than $200,000.  Just to underscore, this is the first bill out of the gate here in which we are talking about any kind of tax cuts. We are already seeing Republicans cutting taxes for the wealthy while raising taxes on the middle class and raising their healthcare costs if they can find healthcare. These tax cuts are just the start. Wait until we get to tax reform, when we are going to see this whole debate happen again. My guess is that middle-income people are going to end up paying the bill--paying more--and the wealthy people are going to get another round of tax cuts.  To add insult to injury again, there are the sweetheart deals so that the CEOs of the biggest insurance companies can get pay raises--can get more money--while people will pay more if they work or are poor or middle class. There are tax cuts for prescription drug companies of $30 billion, but the bill does nothing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. This, certainly, is not healthcare for the majority of This, certainly, is not healthcare for those who need to have access to affordable healthcare.  Then it is back to our seniors, who will pay more because of the changes in how healthcare costs will be rated. We will, essentially, see older people having twice the tax credit but five times more the cost. I am not sure exactly how it is being proposed for preexisting conditions. We are still working through that. I do know that the bill has a penalty. If you have health insurance and, for some reason, there is a crisis in your family and, for some reason, you cannot continue it and you drop that insurance and then you reenroll again, there is a 30-percent late enrollment surcharge. You will be paying 30 percent more for your health insurance if you have a preexisting condition.  There are just two other items that are very important. I know that the distinguished Presiding Officer shares the concern about this as well, which is the fact that we have been able to create more access to healthcare by expanding Medicaid, which is critically important.  One of the great success stories in Michigan today is that 97 percent of our children in Michigan can now see a doctor--97 percent. We do not want to go backward. Every child should have the ability to see a doctor--every mom, every dad, every grandpa, every grandma. Right now, in Michigan, 97 percent of children can see a doctor because of the work that we did on the Affordable Care Act, including in the expansion of This goes away. It takes a couple of years, but that goes away.  Instead, what is proposed, essentially, is a voucher, but it has been called a lot of names. There used to be folks talking about a block grant to the Now they call it ``per capita.'' Yet it is really simple. Just like there have been proposals by Republicans for years to have a voucher for Medicare, now this is, essentially, a voucher for Medicaid of X number of dollars. If you need more for your nursing home care, then you are on your own. There are X number of dollars for your child, for a family. If you have something happen and you get sick and you need surgery or if you have cancer and it goes above that voucher, you are on your own.  It completely changes Medicaid from an insurance system to a system of, essentially, a voucher. Millions and millions and millions of children, of families, of seniors--the majority of seniors in nursing homes get their coverage through Medicaid--and our moms, dads, grandpas, and grandmas, who right now get quality nursing home care because of Medicaid, will be severely impacted by this voucher that caps how much care they will be able to receive.  Finally, for over half of the population--for those of us who are women--we will see a return, essentially, to a woman being a preexisting condition. Essential services for women--maternity care, which I was at the front of the line in fighting for, and prenatal care--are not available in the majority of private plans a woman tries to buy without her paying more. You can get maternity care, but it is not viewed as basic. It may be basic to you, as a woman, but insurance companies say: Sure, we will cover maternity care, but you have to pay more. Forever, women have been paying more for their basic healthcare. Under the Affordable Care Act, that changed when we said: Do you know what? As a woman, you should not have to pay more for the basic care you need.  Now all of that goes away under the House proposal. Just to make sure that we see women's healthcare taken away, Planned Parenthood is defunded. Yet 97 percent of what they do is basic care--mammograms, getting to see your doctor, OB/GYN, prenatal care, and all of the things you need for annual visits and so on. That is completely defunded.  I congratulate everyone who has been involved in the effort to make sure that birth control is affordable for women, and under the Affordable Care Act, we have done that. This is an economic issue; this is not a frill for women or for men or for families or for those who have worked hard to make sure we can lower unintended pregnancies in this country.  The good news is that we are at a 30-year low in unintended pregnancies, a historic low in teen pregnancies, and at the lowest rate of abortions since 1973--1973. Why is that? That is because women have been able to get the healthcare they need. They have been able to get affordable birth control to be able to manage their healthcare, as well as seeing the economy improve. But we are seeing more and more where more information is being made available, costs for basic preventive care is down, and women having access to what they need in healthcare allows them to be in a situation where we are seeing these historic lows on unintended pregnancies, teen pregnancies, and abortions.  I know in Michigan we have a number of counties across Michigan, particularly in rural communities, where the Planned Parenthood clinic is the only provider of basic healthcare. It is the only provider for family planning and for cancer screenings and basic healthcare for women and for many men. It may be the only provider in the community. More than half of Planned Parenthood health centers are in rural and underserved communities. About one-third of all of the women living in those communities where Planned Parenthood is available find that this is the only healthcare provider available to them.[[Page S1619]]  So support for women, preventive healthcare, and Planned Parenthood funding are cut completely in this bill. Access to maternity care, prenatal care, and other basic essential services is eliminated. If you want that, you can pay more as a woman.  On top of that, we are seeing essential services like mental health and substance abuse services and other basic comprehensive services that we said for the last several years should be available--healthcare above the neck as well as healthcare below the neck should be viewed as essential services for people across All of that goes away with this proposal.  So, in my judgment, this is a mess. It is going to create a mess, with more costs, less service, shifting taxpayer dollars to the wealthy, while asking the middle-class and low-income families to pay more. This is simply not a good deal.  I would welcome the opportunity to work with colleagues on something that makes sense. Let's put aside this whole effort of repeal. Let's focus on how we can bring costs down, including prescription drugs, and continue to move forward, but let's not go back. When 97 percent of the children in my State can see a doctor today, that is worth keeping. That represents the best of our values. We can't go backward. The proposal we are seeing in the House would take us back to a place that would hurt the majority of Americans, and I strongly oppose it.

As you can imagine, building a State out of a frontier, particularly one so far away from the rest of the country and in such an extreme climate, was challenging, to say the least. It demanded, and still does, a certain kind of person with a certain kind of toughness, vision, and a determination to work for the good of all. Let me give you an example of what it has required.  Some members of the first territorial legislature in 1913--46 years after the purchase--who lived in far flung places faced a challenge. Specifically how to get to Juneau to begin to hash out creating the rules of a new territory.

My State is also an idea, a dream; it goes beyond borders and represents so much about America that we hold dear: beauty, freedom, self-sufficiency. It has been this way even before Alaska became a territory--when a group of people, led by former Secretary of State William Seward, pushed the country to buy Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. As has been proven, that was a good deal.  Every week, I have been coming down to recognize an Alaskan of the Week, a special person who gives their time, energy, and talents to making our State the best in the country.

We are a State because of him, and others, including Secretary of State William Seward, who had vision and tenacity.  Senator Sumner was born on January 6, 1811, in Boston, He was a lawyer, a professor, and then a politician. He was a man of purpose, principle, and many, many words and opinions. In fact, he was nearly caned to death while working in the Senate Chambers, by one of his colleagues--a congressman from the South--for expressing his opinions on the horrors of slavery. It was a deplorable act, and it cast a pall of shame over this body for years. Senator Sumner never really recovered, but after a long convalescence, he set his sights on the Alaska  He was skeptical, at first, until Secretary of State Seward got his ear, and he immersed himself into the accounts of the promise of this new territory, which turned him into an ardent supporter. On April, 8, 1867, Senator Sumner, using only notecards, gave a 3-hour speech on the Senate floor about our  He spoke of Alaska's abundant resources. He saw the Pacific as the ocean of the future and argued that Alaska is the key to that future. He spoke of the treasures--the gold in our land, the veins of coal, our huge mineral deposits, and the treasures below the Arctic He talked about the ``multitudes of fish,'' the thousands of acres of timber, and the opening of new trade routes.  He and others saw in Alaska the ``Eden of the North''--a future which would entail up to 1 million self-sufficient Americans supported by the resources of the land. Owning Alaska would give us greater control of the next ``great theater of action'' in the Arctic and Asia-Pacific, for both national security and economic reason.  In the new territory of Alaska, ``Commerce will find new arms; the country new defenders, the national flag new hands to bear it aloft,'' Senator Sumner argued. A ``boundless and glorious future,'' awaits, he and other supporters argued.  Senator Sumner ended his epic 1867 speech by arguing that the whole territory, not just the peninsula, should be given the name by the people who lived here. ``It should be indigenous, original, coming from the soil,'' he said. ``Alaska,'' he concluded, ``the great land.''  The day after Sumner's Senate speech, the once-skeptical U.Senate approved the purchase by a vote of 37 to 2. One hundred and fifty years later, Alaska has made good on that early promise. We have contributed enormous resources to our country. We are vital to our country's national defense, our national pride, and our economic growth.

8374,topic-id,1316,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to rolling back workplace safety protections for American workers. This use of the Congressional Review Act would endanger employees and throw away four decades of precedent for the sole purpose of protecting companies that repeatedly violate safety standards.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly known as OSHA, is among the best tools we have to ensure that companies adhere to basic safety standards. Because the agency's budget is so small compared to its critical task, OSHA relies on accurate data to focus on the companies that pose the greatest danger to employees.  The previous administration sought to clarify and codify the responsibility companies have to maintain an honest record of their employees' injuries and illnesses. This resolution would undermine OSHA's ability to target serial offenders by removing companies' obligation to keep reliable data about safety issues in the workplace. If passed into law, the resolution would essentially grant amnesty to companies with years of workplace safety violations, while sending a clear message to employers that the Federal Government is no longer committed to worker safety.  Mr.Speaker, I have asked the question many times since the President took office, and I will ask it again today: How does this give power back to the people? How does undermining workplace safety regulations support middle class Americans? How does protecting companies that repeatedly violate safety standards improve the life of workers? The answer is that it doesn't.  I call on my colleagues to stand with working Americans who deserve a safe workplace and vote ``no'' on this resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the UAW opposing the repeal of this rule and also a letter from National Nurses United in opposition to H.83.[[Page H1427]]                                                          UAW,                                                February 28, 2017.       Dear Representatives: On behalf of the more than one      million active and retired members of the International      Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural      Implement Workers of America, UAW, we strongly urge you to      oppose H.Res 83. This misguided resolution undermines      workplace health and safety standards in the most dangerous      industries. The proposed legislation will make it much harder      for the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to      ensure the safety and health of America's workers.       Since the early 1970s, OSHA has required employers to      maintain a safety record for five years and make reports to      the Department of Labor (DOL). These records are used by      workers and employers to identify hazards, fix them, and most      importantly, keep accidents from happening in the future. DOL      utilizes these records to publish statistics on workplace      injury and illness rates and OSHA relies on them to allocate      scarce resources.       OSHA issued the recordkeeping rule to clarify an employer's      responsibility to maintain a safe workplace. The rule does      not impose any new costs or obligations on employers and only      covers larger businesses with the most high risk occupations.       Accurate injury and illness records are critically      important for workers and their families. Having the      necessary tools to collect complete and accurate data on      work-related injuries and illnesses is a key component in      reducing, mitigating, and eliminating hazards and deaths in      the workplace.       Historically, OSHA has assessed and enforced injury      recordkeeping requirements under every administration. In      turn, workers in America have enjoyed a much safer work      environment. We must not take away or reduce OSHA's role in      improving health and safety conditions for workers and we      must ensure the accuracy of the reporting requirements.      Tremendous gains have been made in workplace hazard      reporting. We cannot go backwards.       The UAW members have a long and storied history of securing      workplace protections for all of America's workers. This bill      undermines those gains and more than 40 years of solid      science and practice.       We urge you to resoundingly reject H.Res 83 and vote No      when it comes to the floor.           Sincerely,                                                      Josh Nassar,     Legislative                                  ____                                       National Nurses United,                                                February 27, 2017.     Re Letter in Opposition to H.83, Congressional Review          Act Resolution to Block OSHA Injury and Illness          Recordkeeping Clarification     Virginia Foxx,     Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Robert Scott,     Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,          House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of      over 150,000 members across the country and as the largest      organization representing registered nurses in the United      States, National Nurses United (NNU) urges you to oppose H.     83, which would block the Occupational Safety and Health      Administration's (OSHA) final rule clarifying employers'      continuing obligations to record workplace injuries and      illnesses. By revoking OSHA's authority to enforce      recordkeeping requirements, this Congressional Review Act      (CRA) resolution denudes the agency of the tools necessary to      identify and target patterns of workplace hazards. These      recordkeeping requirements are fundamental to OSHA's ability      to protect workers from job-related health and safety      hazards. But H.83 would leave OSHA with no functional      mechanism to protect workers from longstanding workplace      hazards--health and safety dangers on the job would go      undisclosed and uncorrected. Congress must oppose this GRA      resolution lest it place the health and safety of workers in      serious jeopardy.       The published final rule, known as the ``Volks Rule,'' is a      common-sense measure meant to align OSHA regulations with its      40-year-long practice of enforcing employer injury and      illness recordkeeping requirements as continuing violations      under of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH      Act). Under the OSH Act, Congress authorized OSHA to      promulgate rules requiring employers to maintain accurate      records of workplace injuries and illnesses. Since 1972,      under multiple Republican and Democratic Administrations,      OSHA has required most employers to make and maintain records      of workplace injuries and illnesses for five years from the      date of the injury or illness. Each OSHA Administration has      determined that the five-year record maintenance requirements      were continuing obligations of employers and that OSHA      citations could be issued if a violation were identified any      time within that five-year period. But a 2012 decision by the      D.Circuit Court of Appeals in Volks Constructors v.      Secretary of Labor held that OSHA could not issue a      recordkeeping citation beyond a six-month period despite the      long-standing five-year recordkeeping requirements. There was      a gap in OSHA regulations, and the Volks Rule would fix it,      making agency recordkeeping rules consistent with its      decades-long enforcement practices.       To fulfill its statutory duties to protect America's      workforce from workplace safety and health hazards, OSHA      depends on its ability to enforce injury and illness      recordkeeping requirements. For OSHA to identify workplace      hazards and to develop effective means to correct those      hazards, complete and accurate information about what, where,      when, and how injuries and illnesses occur in the workplace      is vital. OSHA uses this information to develop injury      prevention plans and to efficiently direct OSHA's scarce      resources to worksites that pose the most serious hazards for      workers. Reliable workplace injury data is also fundamental      to the development and maintenance of effective occupational      health and safety standards. Moreover, federal, state, and      local officials also need reliable injury and illness data      during procurement processes, ensuring that taxpayer dollars      to contractors and subcontractors are going to fair and safe      workplaces.       The elimination of OSHA's ability to enforce rules on      workplace safety records allows--and even incentivizes--     employers to obscure ongoing workplace hazards. It would be      nearly impossible for OSHA to identify a recordkeeping      violation and conduct a comprehensive investigation within      six months of the injury or illness, instead of the full      five-year recordkeeping period. Chronic underreporting--left      unchecked if the Volks Rule was halted--erodes OSHA      inspectors' ability to enforce the country's occupational      health and safety laws and allows patterns of serious health      and safety violations to persist. The CRA resolution would      gravely weaken workplace health and safety protections,      exposing workers to serious harm while on the job.       Because workers deserve the full and effective enforcement      of the panoply of our worker protection laws, NNU urges you      to oppose H.83.           Sincerely,                                              Bonnie Castillo, RN,                                    Director of Health and  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1421.txt,2110,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,1.0,April
8609,topic-id,1779,"Mr.President, irrespective of how the Presidential election came out last November, we would be having a conversation about how to fix There are many reasons for that, but most importantly is that it has just skyrocketed costs for people in this country. Premiums have gone through the roof, deductibles have increased, copays have increased, and out-of-pocket costs have become so extensive for people that even if they have coverage, they can't use their plans in many cases. So when our colleagues across the aisle talk about the recently rolled out proposal coming from the House--which they will be discussing and we eventually will be discussing--to try to drive down the costs for people in this country, that is what this debate is really all about.  You can say what you want, but the fact is that this year, 2017, premium increases are 25 percent in the exchanges--25 percent. In six States, the premium increases were 50 percent in the exchanges. I don't know how anybody--any family in this country--can keep up with those kinds of skyrocketing premiums. If you are buying your insurance on the individual market, the roof is blown off.  I talk to people in my State of South Dakota all the time who share with me the excessive amount that it now costs for them to cover themselves and their families. I talked to a lady in Sioux Falls recently, and she told me they are now paying $22,000 a year for health insurance. That is not working. That is why what we had was an abysmal failure.  In terms of choices, the whole idea was that people were going to have options out there. In a third of the counties in America today--one-third of the counties in America today--people have one option, one insurer. It is pretty hard to get a competitive rate when you only have one option. There is a virtual monopoly in a third of the counties in America today.  So we have markets collapsing, insurers pulling out, and we saw that last fall Blue Cross Blue Shield pulled out of the individual market in South Dakota and left 8,000 people wondering how they are going to continue to cover themselves with health insurance. The markets are collapsing, choices are dwindling, and costs are skyrocketing.  The Senator from Michigan was just on the floor talking about how terrible things are going to be under the proposal that is being considered and discussed in the House of Representatives, but the fact is, things are terrible today, and that is why we are having this conversation. Eight in ten Americans think ObamaCare either ought to be repealed entirely or dramatically changed, significantly changed. By any estimation, by any objective measurement or metric, it has been a failure, and that is why we are having this conversation, and that conversation would have occurred irrespective of what happened in the Presidential election last fall.  So let's be clear about why we are here and why we are having this conversation and why we are coming up with a better solution for the American people that will drive down their costs, give them more choices, create more competition in the marketplace, and give them a higher and better quality of care because it restores the doctor-patient relationship, which is so important, not having the government intervening and being in the middle of all of that.                   The Economy and Regulatory Reform  Mr.President, we have a recovery that technically began almost 8 years ago, but for too many Americans, it still feels as if we are in a recession. Americans basically have not had a pay raise in 8 years. Since the recovery began in 2009, wage growth has averaged a paltry 0.25 percent a year--one quarter of 1 percent increase in pay per year since 2009. Well, imagine if you are a family and you are looking at everything that is going up in your lives, whether it is healthcare, which I just talked about, or the cost of education or the cost of energy or the cost of food, all of these things that continue to go up, and you are getting a 0.25-percent--one quarter of 1 percent--pay raise on an annual basis. It is pretty hard not to feel like you are starting to sink and your head is going to be below water before long.  Good jobs and opportunities for workers have been too few and too far between. Millions of Americans are working part time because they can't find full-time employment. Even as some economic markers have improved, our economy has stayed firmly stuck in the doldrums. Economic growth for 2016 averaged a dismal 1.6 percent, and there are few signs that things are improving.  By the way, the historical average going back to World War II is about 3.2 percent average growth in the economy. So last year we were at one-half of what the average had been going back all the way to World War  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is projecting average growth for the next 10 years at just 2 percent--in other words, long-term economic stagnation.  The good news, though, is that we don't have to resign ourselves to the status quo. We can get our economy going again. Republicans are committed to doing just that. To get our economy going again, we need to identify the reasons for the long-term stagnation we are experiencing.  A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group identified one important problem: a lack of what the organization calls ``economic dynamism.'' Economic dynamism, as the Economic Innovation Group defines it, refers to the rate at which new businesses are born and die.  In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high and significantly outstrips the rate of business deaths. But that hasn't been the case in the United State lately. New business creation has significantly dropped over the past several years. Between 2009 and 2011, business death outstripped business birth.  While the numbers have since improved slightly, the recovery has been poor and far, as I mentioned before, from historical norms. The Economic Innovation Group notes that in 2012--the economy's best year for business creation since the recession--it fell far short of its worst year prior to 2008. This is deeply concerning because new businesses have historically been responsible for a substantial part of the job creation in this country, not to mention a key source of innovation. When new businesses aren't being created at a strong rate, workers face a whole host of problems.  ``A less dynamic economy,'' the Economic Innovation Group notes, ``is one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower labor force participation, slack wage growth, and rising inequality--exactly what we see today.''  Well, American workers clearly need relief, and restoring economic dynamism is a key to providing it. We need to pave the way for new businesses and the jobs they create, and we need to ensure that current businesses, particularly small businesses, are able to thrive.[[Page S1620]]  There are a number of ways we can do this. One big thing we can do is relieve the burden of excessive government regulations. Obviously some government regulations are important and necessary, but too many others are unnecessary and doing nothing but loading businesses down with compliance costs and paperwork hours. The more resources businesses spend complying with regulations, the less they have available for growth and innovation. Excessive regulations also prevent many new businesses from ever getting off the ground. Small startups simply don't have the resources to hire individuals, let alone the consultants and lawyers to do the costly work of complying with the scores of government regulations.  Unfortunately, over the past 8 years, the Obama administration spent a lot of time imposing burdensome regulations on American businesses. According to the American Action Forum, the Obama administration was responsible for implementing more than 675 major regulations that cost the economy more than $800 billion. Given those numbers, it is no surprise that the Obama economy left businesses with fewer resources to dedicate to growing and creating jobs or that new business creation seriously dropped off during those years in the Obama administration.  Since the new Congress began in January, Republicans have been focused on repealing burdensome ObamaCare regulations using the Congressional Review We have already used this law to repeal three Obama regulations, and this week we will use it to repeal at least two more, including the ``blacklisting'' rule, which imposes duplicative and unnecessary requirements for businesses bidding on Federal Government contracts, and the Bureau of Land Management methane rule, which curbs energy production on Federal lands by restricting drilling. This methane rule would cost jobs and deprive State and local governments of tax and royalty payments that they can use to address local priorities.  Another area of regulatory reform we need to address is ObamaCare, as I mentioned. Repealing the burdensome mandates and regulations this law has imposed on businesses will go a long way toward removing barriers to new businesses and spurring growth at existing businesses.  Another important thing we can do is remove unnecessary barriers that restrict access to capital. Both new and existing businesses rely on capital to help them innovate, expand, and create jobs.  In addition to removing burdensome regulations, tax reform needs to be a priority. Measures like allowing new businesses to deduct their startup costs and reducing rates for small businesses would spur new business creation and help small businesses thrive. Republicans plan to take up comprehensive tax reform later this year, and I look forward to that debate.  The American economy has always been known for being dynamic and innovative, and we need to make sure it stays that way. We need to free up the innovators and the job creators so that the next big idea isn't buried by government regulations before it has a chance to see the light of day.  Sluggish economic growth doesn't have to be the new normal. By removing burdensome government regulations and reforming our Tax Code, we can spur business creation and innovation. We can increase wages and opportunities for American workers, and we can put our economy on the path to long-term health, where that growth rate gets back to that more historic level that allows for better paying jobs and higher wages for American families.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Houses of Congress to achieve these goals, and I am anxious for us to start passing bills that will put policies in place that are favorable to higher economic growth, better jobs, and better wages for the American people and their families.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1616-2.txt,1534,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,7.0,April

Employers who provide community and charitable services that support veterans will also be eligible.  Hiring veterans isn't just the right thing to do because it is morally and ethically right; it makes good business sense, and our folks know that.  The men and women who have served in our military have received invaluable training and experience that has proven to help them thrive in post-military employment. What they need is a foot in the door. Fortunately, we have been seeing encouraging trends in veterans' employment. Thanks to the hard work of DOL VETS, combined with efforts within the private sector and Federal and State governments, the veterans' unemployment rate in January of 2017 was 4.5 percent, which is lower than the national average. We also know that the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans remains unacceptably high at 8 percent.  We must remain vigilant to make sure that the men and women who signed up to defend our Nation enjoy opportunities for growth when they return home. The HIRE Vets Medallion Program represents an additional incentive for employers to hire and retain veterans, which is something we can all get behind.  Again, I thank Colonel Cook for offering this bipartisan legislation. Thank you to the vice chairman for bringing this up and throwing his support behind it. I am certainly proud to stand in support of this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-13-pt1-PgH1109.txt,1856,1700,2017.0,13.0,February

8543,topic-id,3762,"Mr.President, I rise to express my strong opposition to President Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator for the Environmental Protection  The reason is simple. In a choice between corporate polluters and people who want to breathe air and drink water, Scott Pruitt sides with the corporate polluters. He has no business being the head of the  During his nomination hearing, Mr.Pruitt had countless opportunities to answer for his record. His responses were flippant, evasive, and outright misleading. He has been asked repeatedly to provide records from his office concerning dealings with big oil companies, but he told the Senators that, hey, they should submit an open records request, hoping that his confirmation would be over long before those documents would see the light of day.  Just a few hours ago, an Oklahoma district court judge ordered a dose of sunshine for Mr.Pruitt's dirty dealings from his perch as attorney general of The judge has demanded that Mr.Pruitt cough up more than thousands of emails pertaining to his cozy relationship with Big Oil--emails he has been hiding from Oklahoma open records requests for over 2 years, but the Republican leadership is not interested in waiting. Its plan is to jam this nomination through tomorrow--4 days before the emails are slated to become public.  Are you kidding me?  If those emails show corruption, every Senator should have that information before--not after--they vote to put someone in charge of the EPA who may be there for years.  Clean air and clean water used to be a nonpartisan issue. In earlier decades, leaders in both parties had the courage to say no to suffocating smog and towering plumes of toxic chemicals poisoning our children. Republicans and Democrats came together, and together they declared that access to clean air and clean water was a basic right for all We passed the Clean Air Act, and we passed the Clean Water We updated those laws when necessary, and we did those things together.  Together, we depend on the Environmental Protection Agency for three critical reasons: The EPA is the cop on the beat, protecting American families from corporate polluters that would put profit ahead of safety. It watches out for us and for our children; the EPA exists because pollution knows no State borders. What is burned at the powerplant in Ohio is breathed by children across Massachusetts; and the EPA takes on the ever-changing task of researching, monitoring, and regulating toxic emissions because the job is far too great for any one State to tackle.  To do all of this, the EPA routinely turns to local governments, businesses, and innovative workers for local solutions; the EPA turned to the University of Massachusetts to create a research center to assist smalltown water systems; the EPA turned to towns along Cape Cod and on Martha's Vineyard to pursue innovative solutions to increase coastal resiliency as sea levels have risen; and the EPA recently recognized New Bedford's exceptional work in monitoring industrial waste discharge in the city's collection system.  Across Massachusetts and across the Nation, the EPA sets big national goals that help inspire ingenious local solutions. The EPA is one of our great successes as a nation, but that success has not come without a fight. Each time the EPA has taken a step to clean our air, industry has poured more and more money into the debate, yelling that regulation is just too costly and that companies can never survive if they have to clean up their act.  In the 40 years following the Clean Air Act, emissions of common air pollutants fell nearly 70 percent while the number of private sector jobs doubled. Industry talks about the costs of pollution controls because dirty is cheap. Clean air saves more than 160,000 lives each year. Clean air saves more than 3 million schooldays our children would have collectively lost. Clean air saves 13 million workdays the hard-working, healthy Americans simply can't afford to miss.  Scott Pruitt doesn't measure success by this yardstick. He measures success by how happy his corporate donors are. As Big Oil's go-to attorney general from Oklahoma, Pruitt has spent the last 6 years trying to silence the lifesaving, data-driven work of dedicated EPA employees and scientists. And now, those big polluters have their fantasy EPA nominee--someone who will work on their side and not on the side of the American people.  How about a couple of examples. When EPA issued a rule to limit mercury, arsenic, and other toxic chemical emissions from coal powerplants, Mr.Pruitt questioned whether mercury poses a health hazard. Mercury is a well-known neurotoxin. It means that it poisons the nervous system. And Scott Pruitt thinks he should question whether it poses any health hazard.  Or maybe it is this example. When the EPA moved to reduce leaks of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 30 times more potent than CO2, he turned the Oklahoma AG's office into a clearinghouse for big oil to pursue lawsuits attacking the Scott Pruitt has spent so much time with his campaign donors that he honestly appears incapable of understanding the difference between the financial interests of millionaires who run giant oil companies and the health and well-being of the 4[[Page S1272]]million human beings who actually live in  The people need a voice more than ever. For generations, Oklahoma has had very few earthquakes. Then, oil companies decided to up production, to pull every last drop of oil out of the ground. But with every drop of oil came useless, toxic radioactive salt water waste, and it has to go somewhere. So they took the cheapest option available: Pump billions of barrels of wastewater deep underground, under immense pressure, and that is when the problems started. Suddenly, earthquakes--big earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 and above, started occurring every day across  Here was Mr.Pruitt, the State attorney general, the people's lawyer. What did he do? Did he seek relief for the families that were stiffed by insurance companies? Did he join residents who were suing to stop the drilling while their homes crumbled? Did he even pretend to do something--you know, like maybe issue a strongly worded press release supporting frightened citizens? No, not Mr.No, Mr.Pruitt stood by his friends in the oil industry, and the heck with everybody else.  Mr.Pruitt has been consistent in his work for big oil. As attorney general, he dismantled the environmental protection unit in his office--dismantled the environmental protection unit. He appointed a billionaire oil man to be his 2014 campaign chair, and he ignored the citizens he was sworn to protect. That is the measure of Mr.Pruitt as a public servant.  A State attorney general is supposed to serve the people. Right now, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey is leading the case to prove that ExxonMobil deliberately deceived the public about the impact of climate change on our economy, our environment, our health, and our future. Good for Did Scott Pruitt join that suit? Of course not. Pruitt ran to the defense of one of the world's largest corporations, whining about how that corporation felt bullied. Instead of working as the attorney general for Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has served as the attorney general for  Finally, Scott Pruitt has the nerve to say that the cause of climate change is ``subject to more debate.'' More debate? We had that debate in the 1980s, in the 1990s, in the 2000s. Maybe Mr.Pruitt missed it, buried under a pile of big oil money.  So let me just offer a summary. For well over a century, we spewed fossil fuel filth into our atmosphere. And, yes, this allowed us to fuel the thirsty appetite of our 20th century economy. But that blistering pace came at a price.  Our planet is getting hotter. Our coasts are threatened by furious storm surges that sweep away homes and devastate our largest cities. Our poorest neighborhoods are one bad storm away from being under water. Our naval bases are under attack--not by enemy ships but by rising seas; droughts and wildfires are all too familiar across the country. Refugees are fleeing homes that are no longer livable. And the risk of rapidly spreading diseases like malaria and Zika is on the rise.  Our coastal communities don't have time for politicians who deny science. Our farmers don't have time for more debate. Our children don't have time for more cowards who will not stand up to big oil companies defrauding the American people.  Scott Pruitt has been working hard for big oil to dismantle the EPA, and now, President Trump wants to give him that chance.  Where are the Senators who will stand up for the health, the welfare, and the safety of their citizens? Where are the Senators who will stand up for the people's right to breathe clean air and drink clean water? Where are the Senators who will have the courage to demand action on climate change so that our children will have a chance to inherent a livable Earth?  In the end, despite this despicable record, if the Republicans link arms again, there will not be enough of us to stop this nomination. But make no mistake, if President Trump wants a fight over the health of our children, a fight over the creation of clean energy jobs, a fight over the very future of our planet, then we will fight every step of the way.  We will fight alongside moms and dads who know the terror of a childhood asthma attack. We will fight alongside the cancer victims. We will fight alongside the fishermen and the hunters. We will fight alongside the families of Flint, MI, and everywhere else in America where families cannot safely turn on their water taps or step outside and take a deep breath.  We are all in this together.  People in Massachusetts care deeply about preserving a safe and healthy environment for our kids and our grandkids. We see it as a moral question. And I receive letters from people all across the State, describing how important clean air and clean water are to them and how worried they are about what Scott Pruitt leading the EPA will mean for our most vital natural resources. I hear those concerns and I share those concerns.  I would like to read just a few of the many letters that I have received about this nomination.  Edward from Dennis wrote to me on behalf of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod about the importance of the EPA to coastal communities in Here is Edward's letter:       The Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), the Cape Cod      region's leading nonprofit environmental education and      advocacy organization, writes to state our strong opposition      to the appointment of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt      for the position of Administrator of the Environmental      Protection We urge you to vote against his      nomination.       APCC is deeply concerned that Mr.Pruitt's record of      vigorously opposing the efforts of the EPA to protect the      nation's water and air quality is in direct conflict with his      responsibilities as EPA Administrator to ensure that the      agency's important work continues. In fact, his record      clearly shows that his loyalties side with polluters      instead of with the environment and the welfare of the      American people. Of particular concern is Mr.Pruitt's      refusal to accept the science of climate change and the      implications this has for EPA's ongoing efforts to reduce      greenhouse gas emissions.       In addition, the EPA has most recently played a vital role      in furthering efforts to protect and restore water quality      through its Southeast New England Program (SNEP) for      Watershed Restoration, a program that has greatly benefited      coastal communities in Rhode Island and southeastern      We worry that important initiatives such as      the SNEP program, which was originally proposed by Senator      Reed with the strong support from each of you, will be in      jeopardy under the oversight of Mr.Pruitt, should he be      confirmed as EPA       The New England states, as well as the entire nation, have      made significant strides forward in addressing the protection      of our air and water. However, much more needs to be      accomplished. With so much at stake, we cannot afford to step      backward in our effort to protect the environment. We,      therefore, urge you to oppose the nomination of Mr.Pruitt      for EPA  Thanks, Edward, for writing, and thanks to all of you at the Association to Preserve Cape Cod for the work you are doing every single day. It makes a real difference.  While all sorts of people have written to my office about Mr.Pruitt, I have noticed that a lot of people are writing in about kids--their kids, kids they work with, or just kids in general. My constituents are concerned about Scott Pruitt's commitment to protecting the air our kids breathe and the water they drink, and I share those concerns.  I heard from Mary in Worcester, who is concerned about the effects of environmental toxins like lead on children. She is concerned both as a parent and as a family doctor. Here is what Mary had to say:       With so much focus in Washington on ensuring politicians      are held to a strong ethical standard, I ask you to oppose      the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA I wrote      to you yesterday asking the same, but after the hearing      yesterday, it is increasingly clear that Mr.Pruitt is unfit.       In addition to being a parent, I am also a Family Medicine      physician. Rarely, I see children who are exposed to lead      through environmental sources. This is rare because lead has      been regulated, and as such rates of lead poisoning, and the      accompanying irreversible brain damage, have plummeted.       But yesterday Mr.Pruitt revealed that he knows nothing      about this issue, responding to Senator Cardin, ``Senator,      that is something I have not reviewed nor know about.''       I continue to ask you to oppose him and to encourage      colleagues to do the same.  Thank you for writing, That is why I am here tonight--to encourage my colleagues to oppose him.  I heard from Elizabeth in Belchertown, as well. Here is what she wrote:       As a resident of MA and a teacher of AP Environmental      Science in a public high[[Page S1273]]     school in western MA, I am writing to express my concern      about the appointment of Scott Pruitt as director of the      He appears to be the exact opposite of the qualifications and      perspective of a person who should have that position. As you      know, he has close ties to fossil fuels, has repeatedly sued      the EPA, avoided mercury legislation, and espoused the belief      that the EPA is too powerful. I urge you to work with other      Senators to block this appointment.  Thank you, The work that you are doing, that teachers are doing, is more vital than ever now, and I share your concerns. Thank you.  A man from Boston wrote to me with concerns about Scott Pruitt's ties to fossil fuel companies, and here is what he said:       As a constituent who cares about our environment, I want      you to know I am deeply concerned about the nomination of      Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection       Scott Pruitt is firmly in the pocket of the oil and gas      industry. He is not concerned with the world we leave for our      children. As a father and an educator, I am fighting his      nomination because I have a responsibility to care about the      world I leave children and not merely the wealth my cronies      accumulate.       Pruitt has actively worked to dismantle protections for      clean air and clean water that people and birds need to      thrive. The EPA must adhere to science and support common-     sense solutions for ensuring a healthy environment and stable      climate for people and wildlife.       Please oppose confirming Scott Pruitt and demand a nominee      instead who will represent the vast majority of Americans--     regardless of party affiliation--who support strong action      and safeguards for our air, water, and climate.  I couldn't agree more with what he said.  Wendy from Newton wrote to me about the concerns as well. Here is what she had to say:       Dear Senator, I am appalled and scared by the possibility      of Scott Pruitt to head the It will be disgraceful if he      is confirmed. To appoint someone who stands against      everything that agency is for is cynical, disrespectful and      dangerous in this urgent time of climate change. Now more      than ever we need a strong EPA that believes in science and      will protect us from environmental disaster. I hope you will      do everything you possibly can to fight against Pruitt      getting confirmed.  Thank you for writing.  I also heard from Arlene in Wayland, who is worried about what the future of the EPA means for her two grandchildren. Here is what she had to say:       Senator Warren, please assure your constituents that you      will not support Scott Pruitt's nomination to head the      Mr.Pruitt is an enemy of the agency and of the future of our      environment. He has stood in the way of the agency's purpose      to protect our air and water. He is ignorant of the findings      of climate science and medical studies on toxicity, has dealt      dishonestly with Congress, and is so obviously in the pocket      of the fossil fuel industry. Please use your considerable      persuasiveness and rigor to convince your colleagues in the      Senate to ditch his nomination. The future of my two      grandchildren depends on it. Thank you.  Thank you for your note, I am doing my best, and so are the rest of the We just need some Republicans to help us out here.  Joan from Maynard reached out to me about her experience working with children who have suffered from lead poisoning. Here is what Joan wrote:       I have been an Educational Advocate for children with      disabilities for 24 years. I've worked with children who      suffer from lead poisoning, and they are heartbreaking. Even      the smallest exposure has life-long profound consequences. I      haven't personally seen anything the level of what has      happened in Flint, MI, but I know that it's a tragedy for a      generation of children in       Pollution of our waters is just one of the risks we face if      Scott Pruitt is approved. There are countless more, many      evident and others not readily apparent, but ready to unfold.      Please, please fight this appointment in every way you can.  Thank you, Joan, for writing and for the important work you do. Believe me, I am fighting in every way I can.  A man from North Falmouth wrote to me, worried that the progress we have made on protecting public health and the future of our planet is in danger. Here is what he said:       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a lifelong ally      of corporate polluters. Pruitt's nomination is a clear threat      to the nation's public health and the progress made on      common-sense pollution standards. I cannot tolerate the      appointment of a fossil fuel cheerleader to lead the nation's      environmental protection efforts. In 2014, Pruitt literally      acted as a messenger between Devon Energy and the EPA in an      attempt to stifle public health protections.       Please continue to defend the Clean Power Plan and methane      pollution standards against the influence of the fossil fuel      industry. 64% of Americans are concerned about climate      change, we deserve a leader who will take action to protect      air quality.  Thanks for writing. I really appreciate it.  Since President Trump nominated Mr.Pruitt, I have received hundreds of letters like these from people in Massachusetts who are worried about what he will mean for the environment and for the future of our planet, but I have also heard from the experts, people who understand the ins and outs of the EPA and its mission. Hundreds of former EPA employees who have serious concerns about Mr.Pruitt's record on the environment sent a letter to me and my colleagues here in the Here is what they wrote:       We write as former employees of the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) to share our concerns about Oklahoma      Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications to serve as      the next EPA Administrator in light of his record in      Our perspective is not partisan. Having served      under both Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize      each new Administration's right to pursue different policies      within the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to      change the laws that protect public health and the      environment as it sees fit.       However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental      obligation to act in the public's interest based on current      law and the best available science. Mr.Pruitt's record      raises serious concerns about whose interests he has served      to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of      U.environmental law.       Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that      every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink      and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.      Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in      the U.once looked like before we went to work as a people      to combat pollution. Much of the EPA's work involves      preserving those gains, which should not be taken for      granted. There are also emerging new threats as well as      serious gaps in our environmental safety net, as the      drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, painfully      demonstrates.       Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that      requires EPA to set national standards and give states      latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum      criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that      Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no      matter where they live, and allows states to compete for      business without having to sacrifice public health or      environmental quality.       Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to      allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which      is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is      reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even      when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,      EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit      the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its      harmfulness to public health was erased. His actions spared      much of the harm that some countries still face as a result      of the devastating effects of lead on human health.      Similarly, early action to reduce exposure to fine particle      pollution helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from      heart and lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those      risks did not become apparent until much later.       Mr.Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest      that he does not share the vision or agree with the      underlying principles of our environmental statutes.

8458,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, the question I bring to the floor today is what is Scott Pruitt hiding? Last week, the Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on President Trump's nominee to the Environmental Protection Today, for my 155th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I have unanswered questions about Mr.Pruitt's fitness for that role. His evasiveness at his hearing signaled nothing good about his ties to the industry he would regulate if confirmed, and the lack of curiosity about these industry ties from my Republican colleagues speaks volumes about the political clout of that industry.  One question stood out. Our new chairman, Senator Barrasso, posed the standard question of nominees to Mr.Pruitt in our hearing: ``Do you know of any matters, which you may or may not have disclosed, that might place you in any conflict of interest if you are confirmed?''  Mr.Pruitt answered: ``No.''  Scott Pruitt crawls with conflict of interest. He has conflicts of interest with the fossil fuel industry from his political fundraising. We just don't know how bad. He likely has conflicts of interest from confidential private meetings with fossil fuel companies at Republican Attorneys General Association get-togethers, but we just don't know how bad. There is almost certainly evidence of conflict of interest in his undisclosed emails with fossil fuel companies, but again we don't know how bad. He came clean on none of this in his confirmation hearing.  This chart is a simple, and a likely incomplete, representation of the many financial links reported between Pruitt and the fossil fuel industry. At the top are the companies and the entities that have supported Mr.Pruitt with political funding. Down below are the political organizations for which he has raised money.  Pruitt for Attorney General was his reelection campaign. The polluters gave to Pruitt for Attorney Oklahoma's Strong PAC was his leadership PAC, a separate political fundraising vehicle. The polluters gave to Oklahoma  There was another one here called Liberty 2.0, Mr.Pruitt's super PAC, but he closed it down so we don't list it. While it existed, his super PAC took nearly $200,000 in fossil fuel industry contributions. Mr.Pruitt served as the chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association in 2012 and 2013 and was a member of RAGA's executive committee through 2015. Between 2014 and 2016, RAGA received $530,000 from Koch It received $350,000 from Murray It received $160,000 from ExxonMobil, and it received $125,000 from Devon  Devon Energy, by the way, is the company whose letter Mr.Pruitt transposed virtually verbatim onto his official letterhead to send to the EPA as the official position of the Oklahoma attorney general.

8459,topic-id,1039,"This confidential agenda mentions a private meeting[[Page S423]]with Murray It mentions a private meeting with Southern Company, and it mentions a private meeting with American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents a lot of these characters. Murray Energy, of course, is right there. Southern Company is right there, and the American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers organization, I am sure, represents the others.  This confidential meeting agenda is all we have about what took place in those private meetings. I asked Mr.Pruitt in our hearings about the content of these private meetings, and he wouldn't answer any questions. He doesn't want us to know what was discussed there with the big fossil fuel polluters--companies whose pollution he will oversee as EPA  Pruitt was also a chairman of the Rule of Law Defense The so-called Rule of Law Defense Fund is a dark money political operation that launders the identity of donors giving money to the Republican Attorneys General As the New York Times said, the fund is a ``legal entity that allows companies benefiting from the actions of Mr.Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general to make anonymous donations, in unlimited amounts.'' It is a complete black hole of political cash.  In the hearing, Pruitt refused to shine any light into the dark money he solicited or received from these fossil fuel polluters or others for the Rule of Law Defense Fund--not whom he asked for money, not who gave money, not what they gave, nothing. This is an organization that appears to have a million-dollar-a-year budget so someone was busy raising a lot of money. How much exactly, from whom, and what was the deal? Scott Pruitt doesn't want our committee or this Senate or the American people to know.  Colleagues and I sent letters to the Office of Government Ethics and to the Environmental Protection Agency's top ethics official. Their responses indicate that their ethics rules predate Citizens United and its torrent of dark political money. Their regulatory authority on government ethics has not caught up with the post-Citizens United dark money world. Since their ethics authorities have not been updated for these dark money conflicts, if Pruitt doesn't disclose any of this information before the Senate, no one will know, and even those government ethics watchdogs may end up blind to conflicts of interest.  That doesn't mean there isn't a conflict of interest here. What it means is it is a hidden conflict of interest. That makes it our duty in the Senate to examine those relationships, except for the fact that the fossil fuel industry now, more or less, runs the Republican Party, so there is a scrupulous lack of interest in this fossil fuel industry dark money.  How badly does Mr.Pruitt want to hide his dealings with his fossil fuel patrons? An Open Records Act request was filed with the Oklahoma attorney general's office--Mr.Pruitt's office--for emails with energy firms, fossil fuel trade groups, and their political arms, with companies like Devon Energy, Murray Energy, and Koch Industries, and the American Petroleum Institute, which is the industry's trade association.  Let me share three facts about this Open Records Act inquiry: 1, the Open Records Act request was filed more than 745 days ago--over 2 years, 2 years. 2, Pruitt's office has admitted that there are at least 3,000 responsive documents to that Open Records Act request. Consider that fact alone for a moment. There were 3,000 emails and other documents between his office and these fossil fuel companies and front groups--3,000. 3, zero, exactly zero of those documents have been produced--745 days, 3,000 documents, zero produced.  Think how smelly those 3,000 emails must be when he would rather have this flagrant Open Records Act compliance failure than have any of those 3,000 emails see the light of day. Given the important financial interests of these groups before the EPA, do we really not think that 3,000 emails back and forth between him and his office and those groups might be relevant to his conflicts of interest as Administrator? Until very recently, Republicans had a keen interest in emails. Chairman Barrasso asked that important question: ``Do you know of any matters which you may or may not have disclosed that might place you in any conflict of interest if you are confirmed?'' Scott Pruitt answered: ``No.''  On this record, there is every reason to believe that his statement is false. Might having raised significant dark money from the industry that he would regulate create a conflict of interest? Let's say that he made a call to Devon Energy and said: I slapped your letter on my letterhead and turned it in as if it were the official work of the Oklahoma attorney general's office. Now I need a million bucks. And you can give it to the Rule of Law Defense Fund as dark money, without anyone knowing that it was you.  Might such a quid pro quo create a conflict of interest in his ability to carry out the duties of EPA Administrator in matters affecting Devon Energy? It is impossible to say that it would not be a conflict of interest.  Let's say that at those confidential private meetings with Murray Energy and Southern Company, something went on. Might something that takes place in private meetings with Big Energy interests that he is going to have to regulate create a possible conflict of interest? They paid to be there. They wanted something. Might that not give rise to a conflict of interest?  And who knows what conflicts of interest would be divulged if his office were not sitting on 3,000 undisclosed emails with fossil fuel industries that he will be regulating as EPA Administrator?  I challenge anyone to come to this Senate floor and tell me with a straight face that there is nothing that those emails could reveal that might create a conflict of interest for the man discharged with regulating the companies on the other end of those emails. ``No'' just doesn't cut it as an answer from Mr.Pruitt when there is still so much that he is hiding.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

8511,topic-id,962,"Mr.President, I am delighted to rise this afternoon in support of Scott Pruitt, nominated for EPA Administrator, and to congratulate the leadership of this Senate and the administration for persevering on this nomination to the point where we will get a vote tomorrow afternoon and I think be able to end the week on a positive note.  My good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, had just called for a good bipartisan day on the Senate floor, and I support many of the remarks she made in that regard. I would hope we could begin having some good bipartisan days with regard to the administration's nominations for these important positions.  Sadly, it looks as though we will not have a bipartisan vote for Scott He will be confirmed but not nearly with the vote he should receive from Members on both sides of the aisle who know that there has been extreme overreach on the part of the EPA leadership under the Obama administration. The EPA needs a change in direction, and they need to become more sensible with regard to stopping pollution, while at the same time being friendly on job creation. So we will get this nomination finished tomorrow and we will have a good Administrator, but regrettably it will not be on a very bipartisan basis.  This is the Scott Pruitt whom I have had a chance to learn about since he was nominated in  The Scott Pruitt I have had a chance to learn about took on the polluters as attorney general for his State of Oklahoma and finalized multistate agreements to limit pollution, and he did so working with Democrats and working with Republicans on a bipartisan basis across the political spectrum. I think we need that sort of person as EPA Scott Pruitt negotiated a water rights settlement with the tribes to preserve scenic lakes and rivers, and I think he is to be congratulated on that, not scolded. He stood up to oil companies and gas companies as attorney general for the State of Oklahoma and challenged them when they were polluting his State's air and water. Then--something I applaud--when the EPA overstepped its bounds and its mission and ceased to follow the law, he challenged the I submit to my colleagues that that is exactly the sort of balance we need to return to as Administrator of the  In the hearing, which was rather extraordinary because of its length, Attorney General Pruitt demonstrated his knowledge, he demonstrated his intellect, and he demonstrated his patience. He was available all day long--an extraordinarily long hearing--answered more than 200 questions propounded at the hearing, and then beyond that he has now answered more than 1,000 questions for the record. Yet, in spite of this, it is disappointing that some of my colleagues, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, have taken not only to disparaging his qualifications and his suitability for this position but also engaged in a slow-walking process designed to keep this nomination from even coming forward.  Every Democrat boycotted the committee meeting that was called to report this nomination to the floor so that we could even have an up-or-down vote. They walked out of the meeting. This is the sort of tactic we were able to overcome on a parliamentary basis, but it has given us what we now know is the slowest confirmation process in 225 years. The only President to have a slower confirmation process was the one who was getting it all kicked off to start with; George Washington's was a bit slower. We will see. Maybe if this keeps going, we could surpass the slowness of the confirmation process that occurred for our first  We need a change at The American people are ready for a change at We need an EPA Administrator who will listen to the environmentalists but also listen to the job creators. This means listening to the election but moving past the election and getting on to filling the positions that are[[Page S1244]]important to Americans, such as the EPA  Most Americans believe we can protect the environment and still protect job creators, and so does Attorney General Scott Most Americans believe we can have clean air and water without destroying thousands upon thousands of jobs for That is what I believe. That is what Scott Pruitt believes.  I would quote from a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal which William McGurn wrote in support of Mr.Pruitt but also generally in support of other nominations. With regard to Pruitt, Mr.McGurn says this: ``The fierce opposition to Mr.Pruitt speaks to the progressive fear that he might help restore not only science to its rightful place but also federalism.'' I think that is what Scott Pruitt is going to be about when he is confirmed tomorrow and finally gets down to working for us, the taxpayers, as Administrator of  This is about the 1-month mark in this administration, and we are slowly getting past this unprecedented slow-walk effort by our colleagues. I certainly hope that with the 1,100 other appointments that have to be submitted and have to be spoken to by this Senate, we can hasten the process so we can pass legislation and be about the business our constituents sent us here to do.  Approving Attorney General Scott Pruitt will allow us to move forward with the people's business with a man who has demonstrated courtesy, intelligence, patience, and professionalism, and I will be honored to be one of those voting yes tomorrow when we confirm this outstanding candidate as EPA  I thank the  I yield the floor.

8566,topic-id,613,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor Brookhaven National Laboratory on its 70th anniversary.  The United States is the greatest Nation in the world, and one of the reasons why is Brookhaven National Their science research is aggressively pursuing cures to illnesses, protecting our national security, and increasing our energy independence.  Imagine being able to witness a recreation of the very beginning of our universe, a replica of the primordial soup which once comprised all that had existed right before your very eyes. Also imagine that this very same equipment could be used to find cures to illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.  I am proud that Brookhaven National Laboratory is located in the greatest congressional district in America, the First Congressional District of New  For nearly three-quarters of a century, Brookhaven has stood as a world-class research center that conducts groundbreaking studies within the scientific community. Brookhaven asks the big questions that scientists have been researching for generations, and has allowed us to look into the building blocks of our world.  Between preservation of our ecosystem, studies on the environment, and researching new forms of sustainable energy, Brookhaven is a world leader in scientific research.  There is also incredible cultural and historical relevance of the site of Brookhaven National There was once a World War I Army training center called Camp Upton located where Brookhaven stands today. It was at this camp that Irving Berlin wrote ``God Bless America'' while serving in the U. Brookhaven is not only a local and regional treasure, but also a national asset. The machines in Brookhaven have been utilized by the most brilliant minds in America, from the scientists of MIT and Yale to the engineers at GE and  While there are 17 national labs across our great country, Brookhaven is a unique user facility which focuses in a number of disciplines, not limited to particle physics, chemical engineering, and systems engineering and integration.  In previous Congresses, critical funding has been provided in support of the ARPA-E program for several of Brookhaven's phenomenal projects on energy production and storage, and so much more.  There has been discussion in the past to cut funding for Brookhaven's nuclear physics program to levels that haven't been seen since 2008. This would be a mistake.  Brookhaven features some of the most important scientific efforts in the world, with assets like the National Synchrotron Light Source II, or NSLS-NSLS-II has allowed for incredible advancement in the research and development of super conductors, which have the potential to revolutionize energy consumption in the U.and save into the billions for the American people and American businesses.  Another program in need of our continued support is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, or This multi-faceted machine is essential for studies on matter and has key practical applications, like figuring out[[Page H1132]]how to best protect our homeland using detector technology.  There is also the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer, or BLIP, which has been recently upgraded to advance the field of medical science. This upgrade allows BLIP to better diagnose and treat illnesses, including heart disease and many forms of cancer, such as leukemia and melanoma.  With Congress' continued support, there is limitless potential for needed discovery and advancement.  I thank the Speaker for allowing me to discuss this amazing national treasure. I also thank Doon Gibbs, who is the lab director, for his outstanding leadership at this facility.  It is a privilege to stand here on the floor of the U.House of Representatives to speak on behalf of America's great scientists and their vital work.  Congratulations again to Brookhaven National Laboratory on 70 years of groundbreaking, innovative research.
