                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 135--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF MAY 1, 
              2017, AS ``SILVER STAR SERVICE BANNER DAY''

  Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:

                              S. Res. 135

       Whereas the Senate has always honored the sacrifices made 
     by the wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces;
       Whereas the Silver Star Service Banner has come to 
     represent the members of the Armed Forces and veterans who 
     were wounded or became ill in combat in the wars fought by 
     the United States;
       Whereas the Silver Star Families of America was formed to 
     help the people of the United States remember the sacrifices 
     made by the wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces by 
     designing and manufacturing Silver Star Service Banners and 
     Silver Star Flags for that purpose;
       Whereas the sole mission of the Silver Star Families of 
     America is to evoke memories of the sacrifices made by 
     members of the Armed Forces and veterans on behalf of the 
     United States through the presence of a Silver Star Service 
     Banner in a window or a Silver Star Flag flying;
       Whereas the sacrifices made by members of the Armed Forces 
     and veterans on behalf of the United States should never be 
     forgotten; and
       Whereas May 1, 2017, is an appropriate date to designate as 
     ``Silver Star Service Banner Day'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of May 1, 2017, as ``Silver 
     Star Service Banner Day''; and
       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
     Silver Star Service Banner Day with appropriate programs, 
     ceremonies, and activities.
