                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, we trust You to direct our lives. You are holy, 
ruling in the Heavens.
  Keep our lawmakers faithful to You as You use them to accomplish Your 
purposes. May they hear the groans of the poor, the cries of the 
helpless, and the moans of the oppressed.
  Help our Senators to cause justice to roll down like waters and 
righteousness like a mighty stream. Give them the wisdom to find in You 
a refuge in turbulent times, remembering that You will never abandon 
those who seek You. Grant them the greatness of being on Your side, 
doing Your will on Earth, even as it is done in Heaven.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
