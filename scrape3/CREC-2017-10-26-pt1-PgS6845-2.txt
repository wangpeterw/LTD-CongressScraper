   200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF BAHA'U'LLAH, THE FOUNDER OF THE 
                              BAHA'I FAITH

  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to extend my support for the 
Baha'i community in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the birth 
of Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i Faith.
  Baha'u'llah preached a message of justice, unity, and peace. The 
religion that he founded has spread across the world, including to the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. While the Baha'i people have and continue 
to face persecution for their beliefs, they persevere by promoting a 
message of peace and equality and with a commitment to service. I 
congratulate the Baha'i community of Pennsylvania who have contributed 
so much to the spirit of the Commonwealth on this momentous 
anniversary.
