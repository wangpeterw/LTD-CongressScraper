                             McCABE FIRING

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, our law enforcement and intelligence 
community--most notably, the FBI--is sustaining an unprecedented, 
coordinated attack led by the President of the United States. No one is 
above the law in our country, including the President.
  FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, is the 
latest to fall to this concentrated effort to undermine Special Counsel 
Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's entanglements 
with Russia during the 2016 Presidential election.
  Incidentally, former FBI Director Mueller has served our Nation for 
36 years: as a soldier in the U.S. Navy with a Purple Heart; as a U.S. 
attorney; and also as FBI Director, including after 9/11 when he 
oversaw the transformation of the FBI from a domestic law enforcement 
agency into a global counterterrorism and counterintelligence agency. 
Wow.
  This administration is making every effort to degrade our Federal law 
enforcement institutions and, even more insidiously, by a negative 
media campaign to erode public faith in these institutions. Let truth 
will out.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
