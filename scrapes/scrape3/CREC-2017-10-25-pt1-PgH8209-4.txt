                   REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SAM COKER

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of Dr. Sam Coker, who passed away on October 12, 2017, at 87 years 
of age.
  Dr. Coker was an active member of his community, serving as a church 
leader and board of trustee for 31 years at Young Harris College in 
Young Harris, Georgia.
  First and foremost, he was a Methodist minister, where he served at 
multiple churches across Georgia. Dr. Coker's dedication is exemplified 
by his multiple trips to Jerusalem, where he baptized friends and 
colleagues in the Jordan River.
  In 2015, he was awarded the Young Harris College Artemas Lester Award 
for a lifetime of dedication to Christian service.
  Because of his love for education and others, he created the Gene 
Allison Coker scholarship in honor of his late wife. This scholarship 
enabled many

students to achieve higher education and attend Young Harris College.
  Dr. Coker was a generous man, and he will be greatly missed.
