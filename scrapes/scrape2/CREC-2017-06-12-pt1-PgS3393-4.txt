                      REMEMBERING PAMELA TODD MAY

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Pamela Todd 
May, a dedicated attorney, a compassionate servant, and a respected 
community member. With her passing on May 14 of this year, Kentucky has 
lost an extraordinary woman.
  Pam employed her talents to serve others. As the legal counsel for 
Pikeville Medical Center, PMC, for over 30 years, she strived to 
improve the quality of life for many in her community. Through her 
service as a trustee for the University of Kentucky, Pam guided an 
institution to prepare thousands of students for a lifetime of success. 
Her career also included service as an assistant Pike County attorney.
  To her loyal staff and colleagues, Pam will be remembered not only 
for her skills, but also for her warmth. Although her family and 
community have lost an incredible woman, I hope their memories of her 
love will help to ease their grief. Elaine and I join with so many in 
eastern Kentucky and around the Commonwealth in expressing our 
heartfelt condolences to her husband, Walter, her children, Andrea and 
Philip, and all of her family and friends.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record,)
