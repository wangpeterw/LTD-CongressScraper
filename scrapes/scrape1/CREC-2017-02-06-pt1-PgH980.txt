                   NOAA BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a whistleblower has charged that the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration falsified data in a 
study that attempted to disprove the widely accepted 15-year halt in 
global warming. This was done in an effort to garner public support for 
the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan and the United Nations' 
Paris climate agreement.
  NOAA's officials suppressed internal debate about the study and 
actively obstructed the House Science Committee's investigations of 
concerns about the data. However, one brave scientist decided to step 
forward and blow the whistle on NOAA.
  According to Dr. John Bates, NOAA put its thumb on the scale to 
justify their predetermined conclusions and support the President's 
agenda, even if that meant violating their own scientific integrity 
rules.
  The Science Committee will continue to investigate this scandal. 
Americans have a right to unbiased science.
  We can thank Dr. Bates for his heroic act and for having the courage 
to step forward in the face of the liberal media's smear campaigns.
