                          PROTECT BOB MUELLER

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today the Republicans showed their values.
  They showed their values in the tax bill that gave 83 percent of the 
dollars to the upper 1 percent of the economic strata in this country.
  They showed their values in giving real estate developers special tax 
breaks, like President Trump and others, and gave people who are 
extremely wealthy the opportunity to will more money to their children 
or whoever they choose than they can today, an $11 million break.
  It has been sad sitting on the Judiciary Committee and watching the 
Republicans be aiders and abetters of the President in trying to demean 
the reputation of one of the finest Americans and public servants I 
have ever had the opportunity to know, Bob Mueller, and probably with 
the intention of firing him, something that should wake Republicans up 
to the fact that our country is in jeopardy.
  We shouldn't be doing things that help the Russians get away with 
efforts to change our elections and interfere with our country's 
values. America first, Russia last. Protect Bob Mueller.
