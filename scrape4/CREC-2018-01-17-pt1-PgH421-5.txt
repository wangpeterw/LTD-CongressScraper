              ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS' CANNABIS DECISION

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to Attorney 
General Sessions' unproductive and backwards marijuana policies. By 
rescinding the Cole memorandum on legal marijuana enforcement, Jeff 
Sessions proved that he has one goal as Attorney General, and that is 
reviving the failed war on drugs.
  These policies have proven to be devastating for communities of 
color. For example, African Americans are four times more likely to be 
arrested and incarcerated for marijuana possession than their White 
counterparts. Instead of embracing outdated drug laws, the Attorney 
General should be working to create a criminal justice system that 
treats everyone fairly.
  What is worse, by going after legal marijuana businesses and 
consumers, the Attorney General is really showing a blatant disregard 
for the will of the American people who have voted, mind you, in their 
States for more reasonable and fairer laws.
  That is why I am proud to introduce H.R. 4779. Actually, we 
introduced it last week, along with my friend, Congressman Don Young. 
It is a bipartisan bill called the REFER Act, which would prevent 
harmful Federal overreach. Also, today we are introducing a bill that 
will end the Federal prohibition.
