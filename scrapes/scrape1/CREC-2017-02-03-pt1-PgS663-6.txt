                       NOMINATION OF BETSY DeVOS

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, very briefly because I know we have to 
vote, the nominee for the Secretary of Education is one of the worst 
nominees who has ever been brought before this body for a Cabinet 
position. On the grounds of competence, on the grounds of ideology, and 
on the grounds of conflict of interest, she scores very, very low. That 
is why my good friend, who has great integrity, the Senator from 
Tennessee, had to rush her hearing through. Five minutes of questions 
and nothing else--they were so afraid to hear what she might or might 
not know.
  So I would urge my colleagues over the weekend--those who have 
committed and those who have not--to look into their consciences. 
Sometimes loyalty to a new President demands a bit too much. With this 
nominee, it does. Please think about it over the weekend. This person, 
Mrs. DeVos, does not deserve to be Secretary of Education.
  I yield the floor.
