      URGING PRESIDENT TO NOMINATE A SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSIONER

  (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

[[Page H9852]]

  

  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge 
President Trump to nominate a Social Security Commissioner without 
further delay.
  The Social Security Administration has been without a Senate-
confirmed Commissioner for over 1,700 days. That is almost 5 years. 
This is totally unacceptable. The American people need a Commissioner, 
and they need one now.
  Without a Commissioner, Social Security is just spinning its wheels. 
Important decisions are being put off and service has deteriorated.
  I ask the President to act now to nominate a Commissioner so that 
Social Security can provide the service Americans want, need, and 
deserve.
