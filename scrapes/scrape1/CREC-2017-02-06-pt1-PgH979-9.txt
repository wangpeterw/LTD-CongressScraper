            VETERAN JOHN GRAW, WELCOME TO MINNESOTA'S SIXTH

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome an incredible 
individual who is new to Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.
  John Graw, a World War II veteran, recently moved to Ramsey to be 
closer to his daughters. Upon his arrival in Ramsey--which was, 
coincidentally, the day before Veterans Day--the Ramsey City Council 
awarded John with a key to the city and a letter welcoming him to the 
community.
  John was a master sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Force and served with 
the Mediterranean Allied Air Force that fought in the North African 
Campaign as well as the European theater in Italy and France during 
World War II.
  I am so glad that John received such a warm welcome to Ramsey, 
especially because he came to the defense of our Nation during one of 
its darkest times. It is inspiring to know that this hero lives among 
us, and it is an honor to stand here today and welcome this member of 
the Greatest Generation to our community.
