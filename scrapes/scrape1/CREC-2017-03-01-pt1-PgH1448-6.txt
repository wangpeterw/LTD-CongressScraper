                   CONGRATS EDINA GIRLS HOCKEY CHAMPS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to offer a big congratulations to 
the Edina Girls hockey team for winning its very first Minnesota high 
school State championship.
  The Hornets dominated in the championship game just last weekend, 
winning 4-0. Senior forward Lolita Fidler led the way with an early 
goal in the first period, finishing with two goals. On the other end, 
senior goalie Anna Goldstein stood on her head throughout the 
tournament, allowing just one goal in three games.
  The girls squad finished with an impressive 28-1-1 record under head 
coach Sami Reber, who is a former Edina hockey player herself, bringing 
the title to her alma mater.
  Edina's run of excellence is a testament to their program's serious 
dedication on the ice, in the classroom, and in their community. On top 
of giving their all in their sport, these students also strive 
academically and contribute in positive ways at home and among their 
peers.
  Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of these student athletes, and it is fun 
to see Edina bringing their very first State high school hockey 
championship home.
  Go Hornets.
