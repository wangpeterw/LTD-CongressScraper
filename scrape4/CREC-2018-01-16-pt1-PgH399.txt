       HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND CINCINNATI MAYOR TOM LUKEN

  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to honor former 
Congressman and Cincinnati Mayor Tom Luken, who passed away last week 
at the age of 92.
  Tom Luken was a Democratic stalwart and something of a local 
political legend representing the people of Cincinnati for 15 years in 
this body.
  I learned firsthand just how tough a politician he was when I ran 
against Tom in 1988. He won. But I also learned a great deal about Tom 
Luken, the man, during that race. He was a dedicated public servant who 
always focused on the needs of the people he represented. He was a 
devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
  As many probably know, his son Charlie was also Cincinnati mayor and 
also served in this body for a term.
  Mr. Speaker, even though we were from different political parties and 
disagreed on a lot of issues, I have always respected Tom for his 
commitment and dedication to our community and to our Nation. I hope 
that his wife, Shirley, and his entire family know just how much Tom 
Luken will be missed.
