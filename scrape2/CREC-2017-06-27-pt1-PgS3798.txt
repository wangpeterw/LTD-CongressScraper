                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS

  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:

       POM-43. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States 
     Congress to pass legislation or adopt policies allowing 
     Louisiana to manage the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery 
     out to two hundred nautical miles off the coast of Louisiana; 
     to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 67

       Whereas, in recent years, the Gulf of Mexico has contained 
     the highest total allowable catch of red snapper in decades, 
     but in 2016, anglers experienced the shortest recreational 
     fishing season to date, lasting less than two weeks; and
       Whereas, the federal government has overseen the Gulf 
     recreational red snapper fishery for nearly four decades; 
     today, federal management systems attempt to regulate red 
     snapper fishing by the pound with tools specifically designed 
     to manage the commercial sector, despite the fact that 
     federal data collection systems are incapable of accounting 
     to such a level of specificity for recreational harvests; and
       Whereas, the federal government has, moreover, neglected to 
     use recent data to provide meaningful guidelines and 
     requirements for a systematic reallocation of federal 
     fisheries; except for minor adjustments to account for errors 
     in its own data collection system, the Gulf red snapper 
     fishery allocation is based on highly suspect data from 1979-
     1986 and has remained unchanged since 1991; and
       Whereas, the federal government is currently promoting a 
     management strategy to privatize the Gulf red snapper 
     fishery; approximately fifty percent of the fishery is 
     already held by private businesses, while another twenty 
     percent has been designated to be sold; shares of this public 
     resource have also been given away for free, based on a 
     commercial operator's past catch history; and
       Whereas, because of extraordinarily remiss requirements in 
     its conflict of interest guidelines, the federal fisheries 
     management system allows commercial operators who already own 
     red snapper shares or who may be gifted shares to serve on 
     the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and to cast 
     votes on issues that will result in direct financial benefit 
     for themselves; and
       Whereas, by creating a prohibitive environment for anglers 
     and ethical issues among user groups and stakeholders, the 
     federal government has proved itself incapable of properly 
     managing the red snapper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico, and 
     all five states along the Gulf Coast have increasingly 
     implemented regulations and seasons that are not consistent 
     with the federal management plan; and
       Whereas, numerous studies, including some funded by the 
     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National 
     Marine Fisheries Service, indicate that the greatest economic 
     engine in the Gulf reef fishery is the recreational angling 
     sector, and federal control should be relinquished to the 
     Gulf states, which depend most on this vital public resource. 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes 
     the Congress of the United States to pass legislation or 
     adopt policies allowing Louisiana to manage the Gulf of 
     Mexico red snapper fishery out to two hundred nautical miles 
     off the coast of Louisiana; and be it further
       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to 
     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of 
     the United States House of Representatives and to each member 
     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.
                                  ____

       POM-44. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada supporting and encouraging the retention 
     of federal management and control of federal public lands in 
     the state; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 12

       Whereas, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 of the 78th 
     Legislative Session urged Congress to enact legislation to 
     transfer title to certain federal public lands in this State 
     to the State of Nevada; and
       Whereas, The Federal Government manages and controls nearly 
     80 percent of the land in this State; and
       Whereas, A significant portion of the federal public lands 
     in this State consists of national forests, national parks, 
     national monuments, wilderness areas, conservation areas and 
     wildlife refuges, all of which preserve the natural and 
     scenic beauty of the federal public lands in this State and 
     protect those lands from excessive human encroachment and 
     exploitation; and
       Whereas, The management and control of the federal public 
     lands in this State by various federal agencies in this State 
     confers an economic benefit upon the State of Nevada by 
     saving the State of Nevada from incurring significant costs 
     each year in managing those lands; and
       Whereas, Some of the costs incurred each year by federal 
     agencies include expenses for fighting fires, the management 
     of wild horses and burros and the maintenance of national 
     forests, parks and monuments; and
       Whereas, The retention of federal management and control of 
     the federal public lands in this State will ensure that 
     access to and the use of those lands for recreational and 
     other authorized purposes will remain available to all 
     residents of this State; Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, 
     Jointly, That Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 of the 78th 
     Legislative Session is hereby rescinded; and be it further
       Resolved, That the members of the 79th Session of the 
     Nevada Legislature hereby support and encourage the retention 
     of federal management and control of federal public lands in 
     this State; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the 
     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the 
     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of 
     the House of Representatives, each member of the Nevada 
     Congressional Delegation and the Governor; and be it further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.
                                  ____

       POM-45. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of 
     California relative to new Outer Continental Shelf Oil and 
     gas leasing in federal waters offshore California; to the 
     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

                        Senate Resolution No. 35

       Whereas, California's iconic coastal and marine waters are 
     one of our state's most precious resources, and as elected 
     officials, it is our duty to ensure the long-term viability 
     of California's fish and wildlife resources, and thriving 
     fishing, tourism, and recreation sectors; and
       Whereas, Hundreds of millions of California residents and 
     visitors. enjoy the slate's ocean and coast for recreation, 
     exploration, and relaxation; and tourism and recreation 
     comprise the largest sector of the state's $445 billion ocean 
     economy; and
       Whereas, There has been no new offshore oil and gas lease 
     in California since the 1969 blowout of a well in federal 
     waters; and
       Whereas, Beginning in 1921, and many times since, the 
     California Legislature has enacted laws that withdrew certain 
     offshore areas from oil and gas leasing, and by 1989, the 
     state's offshore oil and gas leasing moratorium was in place; 
     and
       Whereas, In 1994, the California Legislature made findings 
     in Assembly Bill 2444, Chapter 970 of the Statutes of 1994, 
     that offshore oil and gas production in certain areas of 
     state waters poses an unacceptably high risk of damage and 
     disruption to the marine environment; and
       Whereas, In the same bill, the Legislature created the 
     California Coastal Sanctuary Act, which included all of the 
     state's unleased waters subject to tidal influence and 
     prohibited new oil and gas leases in the sanctuary, unless 
     the President of the United States has found a severe energy 
     supply interruption and has ordered distribution of the 
     Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Governor finds that the 
     energy resources of the sanctuary will contribute 
     significantly to alleviating that interruption, and the 
     Legislature subsequently amends Chapter 970 of the Statutes 
     of 1994 to allow that extraction; and
       Whereas, Section 18 of the federal Outer Continental Shelf 
     Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) requires the preparation 
     of a nationwide offshore oil and gas leasing program setting 
     a five-year schedule of lease sales implemented by the Bureau 
     of Ocean Energy Management within the United States 
     Department of the Interior; and
       Whereas, Consistent with the principles of Section 18 and 
     the resulting regionally tailored leasing strategy, the 
     current exclusion of the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf from 
     new oil and gas development is consistent with the long-
     standing interests of Pacific Coast states, as framed in the 
     2006 Agreement on Ocean Health adopted by the Governors of 
     California, Washington, and Oregon; and
       Whereas, In November 2016, the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
     Management released a final 2017-2022 leasing program that 
     continues the moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the 
     undeveloped areas of the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf; and
       Whereas, Governor Brown, in December 2016, requested that 
     then President Obama permanently withdraw California's Outer 
     Continental Shelf from new oil and gas leasing, and along 
     with previous California governors, has united with the 
     Governors of Oregon and Washington in an effort to commit to 
     developing robust renewable energy sources to reduce our 
     dependence on fossil fuel and help us reach our carbon 
     emission goals; and
       Whereas, The California Legislature has led the nation with 
     its landmark climate change legislation, requiring ambitious 
     greenhouse gas emission reductions of a 40 percent emissions 
     reduction below 1990 levels by 2030, and achieving a 
     renewables portfolio standard of 50 percent by 2030; 
     California must lead the nation in fostering the transition 
     away from offshore fossil fuel production to protect both our 
     climate and oceans from the damaging impacts of climate 
     change, which will affect all life on earth for generations 
     to come; and
       Whereas, There are renewed calls for opening offshore areas 
     for drilling and for lifting moratoriums on energy production 
     in federal areas, which could lead to more oil spills and 
     increased dependence of fossil fuels; and
       Whereas, The California Legislature considers new oil and 
     gas development offshore

[[Page S3799]]

     of California to be a threat to the nation's economy, 
     national security, and state's ambitious renewable energy 
     goals; Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, That the 
     Senate strongly and unequivocally supports the current 
     federal prohibition on new oil or gas drilling in federal 
     waters offshore California, opposes attempts to modify the 
     prohibition, and will consider any appropriate actions to 
     maintain the prohibition; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies 
     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the 
     United States, to the Governor of California, to the Majority 
     and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to the 
     Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of 
     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from 
     California in the Congress of the United States, to the 
     Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior, to 
     the Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and to 
     each member of the California State Senate and Assembly.
                                  ____

       POM-46. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada expressing support for the determination 
     of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Sustaining America's Diverse Fish 
     and Wildlife Resources to recommend that the United States 
     Congress dedicate $1.3 billion annually in existing revenue 
     obtained from the development of energy and mineral resources 
     on federal lands and waters for programs to diversify the 
     funding for and management of all species of wildlife; to the 
     Committee on Environment and Public Works.

                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 13

       Whereas, The State of Nevada is home to more than 890 
     species of animals, of which 65 of those species are found 
     only in this State; and
       Whereas, Congress has enacted legislation, commonly 
     referred to as the Pittman-Robertson Act, 16 U.S.C. 
     Sec. Sec.  669-669j, and the Dingell-Johnson Act, 16 U.S.C. 
     Sec. Sec.  777-777k, both of which were assented to by this 
     State pursuant to NRS 501.115 and 501.117, respectively, to 
     provide federal aid for the support of conservation, 
     restoration projects and science-based management of game and 
     sport fish financed by hunters, recreational shooters, 
     fishermen and boaters; and
       Whereas, A similarly dedicated and sustainable method of 
     funding is not available for many species of birds, mammals, 
     fish, amphibians and reptiles which are not hunted or fished; 
     and
       Whereas, In 2012, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners 
     approved a Wildlife Action Plan created by the Department of 
     Wildlife; and
       Whereas, The provisions of the Wildlife Action Plan 
     prioritize 256 species of wildlife having the greatest need 
     for conservation and 22 types of habitat that require 
     prescriptive actions to ensure the maintenance of those 
     species and types of habitat for current and future 
     generations in this State; and
       Whereas, There is a recognized need to expand funding for 
     the conservation of wildlife in the United States; and
       Whereas, The Blue Ribbon Panel on Sustaining America's 
     Diverse Fish and Wildlife Resources, consisting of 26 members 
     who are leaders in business and conservation, was recently 
     established; and
       Whereas, The Blue Ribbon Panel was required to recommend 
     alternative methods of funding to support fish and wildlife 
     conservation in this State and to ensure the sustainability 
     of all species of fish and wildlife for current and future 
     generations in this State; and
       Whereas, Securing a dedicated source of federal funding for 
     the conservation of wildlife in this State will likely 
     require this State to provide matching funds similar to the 
     matching funds that are currently required under the Pittman-
     Robertson Act and the Dingell-Johnson Act; Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, 
     Jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the Nevada 
     Legislature express their support for the determination of 
     the Blue Ribbon Panel on Sustaining America's Diverse Fish 
     and Wildlife Resources to recommend that Congress dedicate 
     $1.3 billion dollars annually in existing revenue obtained 
     from the development of energy and mineral resources on 
     federal lands and waters for programs to diversify the 
     funding for and management of all species of wildlife; and be 
     it further
       Resolved, That the members of the Nevada Congressional 
     Delegation are encouraged to support the enactment of federal 
     legislation to carry out the recommendation of the Blue 
     Ribbon Panel; and be it further
       Resolved, That support is expressed for the development of 
     policies and enactment of legislation that broaden dedicated 
     methods of funding:
       1. For the conservation of wildlife in this State;
       2. For carrying out the Wildlife Action Plan of the Nevada 
     Department of Wildlife; and
       3. To provide state matching funds if a dedicated method of 
     federal funding is obtained for the conservation of wildlife 
     in this State; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the 
     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the 
     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of 
     the United States House of Representatives and each member of 
     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.
                                  ____

       POM-47. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States 
     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to review the 
     Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination 
     Provision Social Security Benefit reductions and to consider 
     eliminating or reducing them; to the Committee on Finance.

                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 22

       Whereas, the Congress of the United States of America has 
     enacted both the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing 
     the spousal and survivor Social Security benefit, and the 
     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned 
     Social Security benefit, payable to any person who also 
     receives a public pension benefit earned in public employment 
     not covered by Social Security; and
       Whereas, the GPO can negatively affect a spouse or survivor 
     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or 
     pension benefit earned in public employment not covered by 
     Social Security who would also be entitled to a Social 
     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and
       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor 
     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the 
     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension 
     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases 
     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit even 
     though the spouse paid Social Security taxes throughout the 
     marriage; and
       Whereas, according to recent Social Security Administration 
     figures, more than half a million individuals nationally are 
     affected by the GPO; and
       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned 
     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension 
     benefits in public employment not covered by Social Security, 
     in addition to working in employment covered by Social 
     Security and paying into the Social Security system; and
       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit 
     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may 
     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as 
     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public 
     servant in employment not covered by Social Security; and
       Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking individuals to lose a 
     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they 
     earn themselves; and
       Whereas, according to recent Social Security Administration 
     figures, more than one and a half million individuals 
     nationally are affected by the WEP; and
       Whereas, in certain circumstances both the WEP and the GPO 
     can be applied to a qualifying survivor's benefit, each 
     independently reducing the available benefit and, in 
     combination, eliminating a large portion of the total Social 
     Security benefit available to the survivor; and
       Whereas, because of the calculation characteristics of the 
     WEP and the GPO, they have a disproportionately negative 
     effect on employees working in lower-wage government jobs, 
     like teachers, school workers, and state employees; and
       Whereas, the number of people affected by the WEP and the 
     GPO is growing as nearly 10,000 baby boomers reach retirement 
     age each day; and
       Whereas, individuals drastically affected by the WEP and 
     the GPO may have no choice but to return to work after 
     retirement in order to make ends meet, but the earnings 
     accumulated during a return to work in the public sector may 
     further reduce the Social Security benefits the individual is 
     entitled to; and
       Whereas, the WEP and the GPO are established in federal 
     law, and repeal or reduction of the WEP and the GPO can only 
     be enacted by Congress: Therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby 
     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions 
     as are necessary to review the Government Pension Offset and 
     the Windfall Elimination Provision Social Security benefit 
     reductions and to consider eliminating or reducing them; and 
     be it further
       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be 
     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and 
     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and 
     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United 
     States Congress.

       POM-48. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to 
     enact the Marketplace Fairness Act; to the Committee on 
     Finance.

                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 5

       Whereas, In the case of National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. 
     Department of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753 (1967), the United States 
     Supreme Court held, in relevant part, that Congress alone has 
     the power to regulate and control the taxation of commerce 
     that is conducted between a business that is located within 
     one state and a customer who is located in another state and 
     who communicates with and purchases from the business using 
     only remote means; and

[[Page S3800]]

       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court established in 
     Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), that 
     a state government cannot, of its own accord, require out-of-
     state retailers to collect sales tax on sales within the 
     state; and
       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court also announced in 
     Quill that Congress could exercise its authority under the 
     Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution to decide 
     whether, when and to what extent the states may require the 
     collection of sales tax on remote sales; and
       Whereas, The State of Nevada and municipalities within this 
     State receive significant operating revenue from sales taxes 
     collected by brick-and-mortar businesses and online vendors 
     with a nexus to the State and from use taxes on purchases 
     made online through vendors without a brick-and-mortar 
     location in the State; and
       Whereas, Remittance of use taxes not collected by a vendor 
     from online purchases imposes an undue burden and widely 
     unknown obligation on consumers; and
       Whereas, The unequal taxation schemes as between online and 
     traditional retailers create a disadvantage for Nevada-based 
     retailers, who are rooted and invested in the Nevada 
     community and employ residents of this State; and
       Whereas, The tax collection loophole for online retailers 
     deprives local governments of revenue that could be used to 
     fund necessities such as schools, police departments and fire 
     departments, and other important infrastructure; and
       Whereas, The Marketplace Fairness Act was introduced in the 
     112th Congress, again in the 113th Congress and again in the 
     114th Congress, to provide states with the authority to 
     require out-of-state retailers, such as online and catalog 
     retailers, to collect and remit sales tax on purchases 
     shipped into the state; and
       Whereas, The State of Nevada has enacted the Simplified 
     Sales and Use Tax Administration Act, chapter 360B of NRS, 
     which is in compliance with the Marketplace Fairness Act; 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, 
     Jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the Nevada 
     Legislature urge Congress to enact the Marketplace Fairness 
     Act without further delay; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of 
     the United States as the presiding officer of the United 
     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
     each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation and the 
     Executive Director of the Department of Taxation; and be it 
     further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.
                                  ____

       P0M-49. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress not to 
     repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or its 
     most important provisions; to the Committee on Finance.

                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 8

       Whereas, In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act (Public Law 111-148), commonly known as the 
     Affordable Care Act, was passed by Congress and signed into 
     law by President Barack Obama; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act established a 
     comprehensive series of health insurance reforms designed to 
     make universal, affordable health insurance coverage 
     available to all Americans, while also controlling rising 
     health care costs and ending certain common industry 
     practices that limited access to health insurance coverage; 
     and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health 
     insurance coverage by creating health insurance marketplaces, 
     allowing children to stay on a parent's health insurance plan 
     until the age of 26 years, expanding Medicaid and 
     establishing a system of tax credits to assist consumers in 
     purchasing individual health insurance coverage and provide 
     incentives to businesses to encourage them to provide health 
     insurance coverage to employees; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act prohibits an insurer from 
     denying health insurance coverage to a person on the basis of 
     a preexisting condition, prohibits an insurer from rescinding 
     coverage, eliminates lifetime and annual limits on coverage, 
     requires all marketplace plans to provide coverage for 10 
     essential health benefits, including preventative care, 
     establishes a mechanism for consumers to appeal 
     determinations regarding coverage and establishes a system to 
     assist consumers in navigating the health insurance 
     marketplace; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act additionally requires 
     health insurance coverage for annual well-woman visits, 
     screenings for breast cancer and cervical cancer, screening 
     for gestational diabetes, all approved contraceptive methods, 
     sterilization procedures and patient education and counseling 
     services often provided by nonprofit organizations such as 
     Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.; and
       Whereas, In particular, since Nevada chose to participate 
     in the expansion of Medicaid in 2011, approximately 181,000 
     new enrollees obtained health insurance coverage in Nevada 
     through the Medicaid expansion alone; and
       Whereas, It has been estimated that 370,000 adults in this 
     State stand to lose health insurance coverage if the 
     Affordable Care Act is repealed; and
       Whereas, It has been estimated that Nevada could lose an 
     estimated $1 billion in Medicaid funding if the Affordable 
     Care Act is repealed; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act provides many other 
     benefits and protections to ensure access to health care by 
     all; and
       Whereas, Congressional leaders have proposed repealing the 
     Affordable Care Act during the 115th Congress without a plan 
     to replace the Affordable Care Act which adequately protects 
     the thousands of Nevadans who benefit from or may not have 
     access to health insurance coverage without the Act; and
       Whereas, The Congressional Budget Office reported that the 
     congressional plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act will 
     cost 24 million Americans their health insurance coverage by 
     2026; and
       Whereas, Repealing the Affordable Care Act without 
     establishing mechanisms to preserve the significant 
     improvements and protections afforded by the law, and without 
     adequately providing for those who stand to lose their health 
     insurance coverage upon repeal, will have significant 
     detrimental effects on individuals and their families, on the 
     health care industry in general and on the overall economic 
     well-being of both Nevada and the nation as a whole; Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, 
     Jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the Nevada 
     Legislature hereby urge Congress to fully preserve the 
     critical benefits afforded by the Affordable Care Act which 
     many Nevadans have come to rely upon; and be it further
       Resolved, That Congress should maintain federal funding for 
     organizations, such as Planned Parenthood Federation of 
     America, Inc., that provide essential family planning, cancer 
     screenings and other preventative health services to 
     Nevadans; and be it further
       Resolved, That Congress should not repeal the Affordable 
     Care Act in a manner that would deny access to these 
     essential programs and services to future generations of 
     Nevadans; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of 
     the United States, as the presiding officer of the United 
     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of 
     Representatives and each member of the Nevada Congressional 
     Delegation; and be it further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.

     Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to review 
     federal laws, rules, regulations, and procedures to ensure 
     that veterans and their family members have convenient access 
     to military service and medical records; to the Committee on 
     Veterans' Affairs.

                       Senate Resolution No. 136

       Whereas, veterans of the United States armed forces have 
     earned the respect, admiration, and gratitude of the state of 
     Louisiana and its citizens; and
       Whereas, the freedom and liberties we are blessed to enjoy 
     today are a direct result of the courage, devotion, and 
     sacrifice of the members of our armed forces; and
       Whereas, it is appropriate to recognize their unwavering 
     selflessness and courage by giving due consideration to all 
     laws meant to protect and assist those veterans and their 
     families; and
       Whereas, in order to apply for certain military benefits, 
     veterans or family members need access to military service or 
     medical records to fill out the application forms and to meet 
     the requirements to apply for the benefits; and
       Whereas, when these veterans or family members need our 
     assistance in accessing their military service or medical 
     records, federal laws, rules, regulations, and procedures 
     should be simple to navigate in order to obtain these 
     records. Therefore, be it
       Resolved that the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana 
     memorializes the Congress of the United States to review 
     federal laws, rules, regulations, and procedures to ensure 
     that veterans and their family members have convenient access 
     to military service and medical records. Be it further
       Resolved that a copy of this Resolution shall be 
     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the 
     clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to 
     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States 
     Congress.

                        Senate Resolution No. 65

       Whereas, The freedom, peace and privileges that citizens of 
     United States enjoy today are the direct results of the 
     sacrifices of the veterans of the Armed Forces who have 
     selflessly served to protect our nation; and
       Whereas, The brave men and women veterans of the Armed 
     Forces, who proudly served the nation and risked their lives 
     to protect our freedom, deserve the investment of every 
     possible resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental, 
     and emotional well-being; and
       Whereas, Investing in the well-being of veterans of the 
     Armed Forces benefits not only

[[Page S3801]]

     those members, but also every citizen of the United States, 
     as such an investment ensures that these individuals will 
     thrive upon their transition into civilian life; and
       Whereas, It is no secret that certain services provided by 
     the government have failed to adequately serve our nation's 
     veterans; therefore, increased funding may improve areas 
     where service to veterans is not sufficiently addressing 
     veterans' needs; and
       Whereas, Veterans of the United States military have served 
     this country with honor and dignity, putting their lives on 
     the line for this country, and at a minimum, deserve quality 
     care and services upon their return from deployment; and
       Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for this House 
     to urge Congress to increase funding for services for 
     veterans returning from deployment; Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:
       1. This House hereby urges Congress to increase funding for 
     services provided to veterans upon their return from 
     deployment.

       POM-52. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of 
     Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take 
     such actions as are necessary to support the domestic beef 
     industry; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
     Forestry.

                       Senate Resolution No. 120

       Whereas, the value of the domestic beef industry is a vital 
     and integral part of the United States economy; and
       Whereas, the 2016 economic impact was approximately sixty-
     seven billion dollars in farm cash receipts for cattle and 
     calves; and
       Whereas, there are over nine hundred thousand total cattle 
     and calf operations in the United States of which ninety-one 
     percent are family owned or individually operated, and eleven 
     percent are operated by women; and
       Whereas, domestic beef production in 2017 is estimated to 
     be approximately twenty-five billion eight hundred million 
     pounds; and
       Whereas, the amount of beef consumed in the United States 
     in 2016 was approximately twenty-five billion six hundred 
     million pounds; and
       Whereas, it is essential to the success of the domestic 
     beef industry to increase international trade to key export 
     markets; and
       Whereas, the promotion of policies which highlight the 
     quality, safety, sustainability, and nutritional value of 
     domestic beef will drive growth in domestic beef exports; and
       Whereas, it is in the nation's best interest to protect 
     against legislative policies or agency regulations that have 
     a negative impact on the economic health of the domestic beef 
     industry; and
       Whereas, minor changes in future domestic beef import or 
     export levels can significantly change the net beef supply 
     and beef prices; and
       Whereas, important steps to supporting the domestic beef 
     industry include developing a comprehensive national strategy 
     for including beef in future dietary guidelines and investing 
     in necessary research to improve productivity and efficiency; 
     and
       Whereas, it is critical to the success of the domestic beef 
     industry to identify barriers and develop strategies to 
     attract and enable the next generation of farmers into the 
     domestic beef industry; and
       Whereas, terrorist attacks have heightened the nation's 
     awareness of agriterrorism and placed a renewed focus on 
     ensuring the protection of the nation's critical 
     infrastructures, including the domestic beef food supply; and
       Whereas, an intentional contamination of the domestic beef 
     food supply could harm millions of people and cripple our 
     vast agriculture system; and
       Whereas, it is critical to preserve the United States 
     domestic beef supply and prevent reliance on foreign nations 
     for food; and
       Whereas, it will be necessary to develop a variety of 
     federal actions to support the domestic beef industry 
     including proposals which encourage domestic beef production, 
     improve consumer demand, protect our nation's critical 
     infrastructure, attract new farmers, improve the business 
     climate, and increase trade to export markets; Therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved that the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana 
     memorializes the Congress of the United States to take such 
     actions as are necessary to support the domestic beef 
     industry; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States is 
     strongly encouraged to adopt import and export policies that 
     will protect the economic survival and prosperity of the 
     domestic beef industry in Louisiana and America and the 
     nation's food supply; and be it further
       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be 
     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the 
     clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and each 
     member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States
