      ANNIVERSARY OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I begin, I would like to take a 
moment to remember the victims of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub 
in Orlando that occurred 1 year ago today. It was the deadliest 
shooting by a single gunman in our Nation's history. Forty-nine 
Americans died that night, and 53 more were injured. They were 
children, parents, sisters, brothers, and friends. They went out that 
night to celebrate with their friends and instead came face to face 
with a soul twisted by an inexplicable hate.
  The best way I can see to honor their memory is to honor them with 
action. We should redouble our efforts to make this country safer from 
the scourge of terrorism and gun violence to ensure that our schools 
and our churches, our theaters and our nightclubs are safe places where 
all Americans can be who they truly are. Let that be our mission as we 
remember the 49 victims of the Orlando attack and keep their families 
in our prayers.
