                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the King of Glory, Your never failing providence 
sustains us.
  Today, inspire our lawmakers with the music of Your wisdom, that they 
may bring hope, joy, and unity to our Nation and world. Remind our 
Senators that even in the darkness, You are a sure guide. Lord, 
energize them to strive to transform dark yesterdays into bright 
tomorrows.
  And, Lord, in this new year, go before us to show us the way, behind 
us to press us forward, beside us to give us courage, above us to 
provide protection, and within us to give us Your wisdom and 
discernment.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
