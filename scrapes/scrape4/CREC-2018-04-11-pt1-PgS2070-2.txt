                   REMEMBERING WILLIAM ``BILL'' VARN

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment 
to recognize and honor the life of William ``Bill'' Varn, a great South 
Carolinian, who departed this life on November 18, 2017. Bill was a 
veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in World War II. After the war, 
Bill joined and eventually took over Enterprise Bank, originally 
located in Smoaks, SC. Mr. Varn served as CEO from 1951 to 2013, when 
he was named director emeritus last spring. It is believed that he is 
South Carolina's longest serving banker ever, and dedicated more than 
70 years of his life to the industry. Today Emeritus Bank is a $333 
million institution spread across six SC counties.
  Mr. Varn will be remembered not only for the great contributions he 
made in the financial services industry, but also for his love of his 
country, State, and family.
