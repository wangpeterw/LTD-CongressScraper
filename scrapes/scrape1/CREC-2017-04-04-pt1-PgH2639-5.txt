                 RECOGNIZING SERVICE ACADEMY APPOINTEES

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three outstanding 
young people from Florida's Second Congressional District who will be 
continuing their education serving our country next year at the Naval 
Academy and at West Point.
  Sean Moriarty and Zachary Moser will be attending the United States 
Naval Academy. Sean plays football at Arnold High School, and Zac is on 
the swim team at Rutherford High School.
  Shane Ferry will be attending the United States Military Academy, 
West Point. He attends Mosley High School and is a member of the 
wrestling team.
  The bar is high and the competition is stiff to earn entry into our 
service academies, and it should be. I am confident that each of these 
young men possess the character, ability, and determination to excel at 
Annapolis and West Point and to earn the privilege to do extraordinary 
things for our Nation and for those who they will one day command.
  As they join their Federal fellow cadets and midshipmen, they also 
have our support and our gratitude for choosing this life of service.
  Thank you and good luck.
