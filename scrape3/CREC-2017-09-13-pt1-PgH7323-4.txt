                             HURRICANE IRMA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I was grateful this 
weekend to visit and thank volunteers at local shelters in the Midlands 
of South Carolina for helping families displaced from their homes due 
to Hurricane Irma.
  At the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Center in Pine Ridge, 
Governor Henry McMaster ably received updates to make thoughtful 
decisions to protect citizens. Emergency Management Division Director 
Kim Stenson professionally hosted over a dozen State agencies with FEMA 
Coordinator Willie Nunn. Adjutant General Robert Livingston and the 
Army National Guard were vital in preparation efforts.
  While visiting the Dent Middle School Red Cross shelter, we were 
welcomed by Principal Tamala Murrill Ashford, Red Cross Executive 
Director Rebecca Jordan, Beth Shwedo, and volunteers dedicated to 
service.
  State officials and the South Carolina Army National Guard have been 
successful leaders for preparation. Attorney General Alan Wilson led 
efforts to reduce price gouging. I appreciate everyone for ensuring 
that citizens had the resources for safety.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers for all 
those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
