            REMEMBERING A PILLAR OF ST. CLOUD, DICK BERNICK

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, this past week our community lost a 
dedicated leader and a friend. Dick Bernick, the patriarch of the third 
generation to run family-owned Bernick's Companies, passed away after 
an incredible life.
  Bernick's Companies is a Minnesota success story. This past year, 
Bernick's and the Bernick family reached an amazing milestone with the 
100th anniversary celebration of the business. Dick played a huge role 
in that success by guiding and growing the family business through good 
and financially difficult times.
  Dick Bernick's life was an American success not just because of his 
business, but because his life was filled with family, friends, and 
service to the community he so loved. Dick gave so much to the St. 
Cloud community. In fact, his company continues to donate a percentage 
of its profits back to different charities and organizations in the 
communities that Bernick serves.
  We send our sincere condolences to Dick's wife, Lila; his children; 
and the rest of his family. We hope that you will find comfort in the 
fact that Dick's life and his legacy of generosity have left an 
indelible mark on the community that he loved, and that he will always 
be remembered.
