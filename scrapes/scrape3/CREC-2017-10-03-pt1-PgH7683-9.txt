  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Old Gregg School Community and Recreation Center on its 
10th anniversary. I recently had the opportunity to visit the 
repurposed school in Spring Mills and partake in the anniversary 
celebration.
  For more than 80 years, the Old Gregg School building in Spring Mills 
educated children and young adults throughout the eastern Penns Valley 
in the time-honored values and responsibilities of community and 
service. The traditions of the historic Gregg Township School have been 
celebrated and expanded in the Old Gregg School Community and 
Recreation Center, which is now a multipurpose, nonprofit facility 
benefiting the entire Penns Valley community.
  Old Gregg School Community and Recreation Center is regarded as a 
treasure in the heart of Penns Valley. It supports small businesses 
with affordable office space, offers athletic facilities for 
recreation, open space for meetings and events both indoors and out, 
and has well-maintained grounds and outdoor play areas.
  Mr. Speaker, Old Gregg is an example of how to repurpose a space to 
benefit the entire community. It truly is a gem of Penns Valley that 
all residents treasure.
