                          RECOGNIZING LEDVANCE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the past 100 years, 
people in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, have been producing light for the 
world.
  Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to visit the LEDVANCE 
manufacturing facility and visit with employees. St. Marys is located 
at the eastern edge of the Allegheny National Forest in the 
Pennsylvania Fifth District. It is a town this has a rich and storied 
history of being a leader in manufacturing.
  The LEDVANCE facility in St. Marys manufactures nearly 2 million 
incandescent and halogen light bulbs--and soon, LED light bulbs--each 
day, in 1,700 packages and varieties. Its employees are skilled, 
knowledgeable, an dedicated to their craft. They are producing state-
of-the-art lighting solutions right in the heart of north central 
Pennsylvania.
  LEDVANCE has locations throughout North America and is a global 
leader in advancing light with LED, traditional and smart lighting, and 
accessories. It was a privilege to tour the St. Marys facility and meet 
with the talented local employees who work diligently each day to 
produce a quality product.
  Congratulations to our workforce in St. Marys on 100 years of 
knowledge and expertise to advance light around the world.
