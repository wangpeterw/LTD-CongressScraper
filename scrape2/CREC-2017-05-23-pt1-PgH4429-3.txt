                 MAY IS AN IMPORTANT MONTH TO HOOSIERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Messer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, May is an important month for Hoosiers. We 
celebrate Indiana's great racing tradition, the Indianapolis 500, and 
our longstanding military tradition on Memorial Day and during Military 
Appreciation Month.
  There are almost half a million veterans living in Indiana today in 
addition to the 30,000 Hoosiers currently serving in the armed 
services, Reserve, and the Guard. We are proud of our military men and 
women in Indiana. These honorable Hoosiers are our fathers, sons, 
mothers, daughters, neighbors, and friends. Service and patriotic duty 
is the Hoosier way. Actually, both of my grandfathers, my Grandpa 
Lathery and my Grandpa Rotzien, served our Nation in the armed 
services.
  This May, as we gather together to celebrate our great Hoosier 
traditions, let's remember the reason that we get to celebrate. It is 
all thanks to the men and women who have put their lives on the line so 
that each of us can be free. On Memorial Day, we, of course, remember 
those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms, but every day 
we can remember that we owe our military families and our vets a debt 
that can never be repaid. Let's all do everything we can to ensure they 
are honored every day.
