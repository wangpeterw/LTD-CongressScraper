                    HONORING THE RICHMOND FREE PRESS

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Richmond 
Free Press, an independent, Black-owned weekly newspaper that recently 
celebrated its 25th anniversary.
  The newspaper was founded by Raymond H. Boone, a former Howard 
University associate professor and reporter who tirelessly served as 
editor and publisher until his death in June of 2014.
  The Richmond Free Press serves as a voice for all people and, since 
its inception, has altered the media landscape of Richmond, the former 
Capital of the Confederacy. The paper has positively impacted the 
community through its news stories and its editorials.
  Through the leadership of Mrs. Jean Patterson Boone, advertising 
director and wife of the late founder, Raymond Boone, this is an award-
winning publication. Not only has the Richmond Free Press been a source 
of information for 25 years, but it has been a pillar in our community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that this recognition come during 
Black History Month, for the Richmond Free Press does not only 
chronicle history, it has made history for the last 25 years.
