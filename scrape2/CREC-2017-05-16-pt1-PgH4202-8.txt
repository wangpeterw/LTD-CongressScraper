                    RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week is National 
Police Week, a time each year when we honor the service and sacrifice 
of our Nation's heroes in blue.
  At this particular time, I especially cherish the memory of Officer 
Greg Alia, a veteran of the Forest Acres Police Department. He was a 
hardworking, humble man, an Eagle Scout, a graduate of Richland 
Northeast High School and the University of South Carolina.

  Greg's end of watch was September 30, 2015, when he was shot while 
pursuing a suspect. He is survived by his wife, Kassy; parents, Richard 
and Alexis; and his young son, Sal. Kassy continues to promote Greg's 
legacy of service through the Heroes in Blue, an organization dedicated 
to sharing the caring and courageous stories of police officers across 
the Nation. As we mark National Police Week, I am grateful to have 
officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Congratulations to the newly crowned Miss USA, Kara McCullough, a 
South Carolina State University graduate who represented the District 
of Columbia. Also, congratulations to Miss South Carolina USA, Megan 
Gordon, of North Augusta, who placed in the top five.
