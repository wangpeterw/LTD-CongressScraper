           EXPRESSING DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment 
in the Democratic Party and to express my concern for the safety and 
security of the American people.

[[Page H164]]

  It has become evident that Democratic leaders and the rest of their 
party are more interested in protecting illegal immigrants and foreign 
nationals than protecting American citizens and passing a budget to 
avoid a government shutdown.
  As a government, we are charged with supporting the well-being and 
safety of all American citizens. In order to fulfill this 
responsibility, we must secure our borders, end chain migration, and 
mandate E-Verify as a national practice.
  We don't need to promote the practice of rewarding illegal aliens by 
providing jobs and safe havens, but, rather, our obligation is to law-
abiding American citizens.
  We cannot take care of the rest of the world if we are unable to take 
care of America and its citizens first.
