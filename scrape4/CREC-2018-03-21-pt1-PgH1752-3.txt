                 IN MEMORY OF OFFICER GREGGORY CASILLAS

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember 
Pomona Police Officer Greggory Casillas, a constituent of mine who was 
struck down in the line of duty.
  It was Greggory's dream to be a police officer. He studied police 
reports after hours, and he always carried flashcards and books to 
prepare for the police officer exam.
  His hard work paid off. Friday, March 9 was the final day of Officer 
Casillas' ghost phase, the last day before he went out on his own. As 
one colleague said: ``I've never met someone so eager to become a 
police officer.''
  Tragically, that was also the day Officer Casillas was shot, trying 
to make contact with a suspect who had fled the police. Officer 
Casillas put himself at risk so that we could be safer, and we can 
never thank him enough.
  I am so grateful for heroes like Officer Casillas, and I join the 
hundreds of others who have attended vigils in his honor when I say 
that he will never be forgotten for his sacrifice.
