                          HONORING LYNN RANEY

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lynn 
Raney, who passed away on December 28. He was a talented artist, a 
dedicated State worker, an admired teacher, and a respected member of 
our central Illinois community.
  Lynn found great joy in serving others. I got to know him during his 
time working in public service for the State of Illinois.
  There was never a day that Lynn did not have a smile on his face, 
even in the midst of difficult family health tragedies. As a matter of 
fact, Lynn Raney helped set up a press conference where he found out he 
was being laid off from the State of Illinois by a new Governor.
  I have no doubt that Lynn will be remembered well for his talent as 
an artist. Not only did he teach art to high school students, but he 
was known for the care and creativity he put into his annual Christmas 
cards. Just before this Christmas, I received one of his cards, and I 
will cherish it even more after his passing.
  I am proud to honor Lynn today. He left a lasting impact on everyone 
who knew him. He was a good friend, a devoted husband, and a loving 
father, who will be missed by many. My thoughts and prayers are with 
his family during this difficult time.
