        IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL LISA L.A. EPPERSON

  (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant 
Colonel Lisa L.A. Epperson on the occasion of her retirement from the 
United States Air Force, the best Air Force in the world.
  Colonel Epperson has given a great deal to this Nation through her 
service. Her assignments include Wright-Patterson, Tyndall, Los 
Angeles, Hill, and Nellis Air Force Bases, and finally here at the 
Pentagon. Colonel Epperson has influenced mission systems from Defense 
Satellite Communications System and Minuteman III, an ICBM, to the F-15 
and F-22. Most importantly, she impacted our warfighting operations in 
Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.
  Throughout her distinguished career, Colonel Epperson represented our 
country with honor, and I am privileged to pay tribute to her. On 
behalf of Congress and the United States, I want to thank Colonel 
Epperson; her husband, David; and their children, Trevor and Cassidy, 
for their 20 years of service. I wish them Godspeed and continued 
happiness as they start this new chapter.
