              MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO NOT TRUST THE MEDIA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist 
poll found that a combined 68 percent of Americans said that they do 
not trust the media very much or not at all. The same poll also found 
that Americans trust President Trump more than the media.
  It is no surprise that Americans do not trust the media. The media 
have stopped reporting and have started attacking. As The Federalist's 
David Harsanyi noted in a recent article, ``News organizations have 
become obsessed with fighting the President rather than covering him.''
  A Harvard study recently found that 80 percent of the news coverage 
of President Trump in his first 100 days in office was negative, a new 
unfortunate record.
  The media is so fixated on attacking the President that they rush to 
print unfounded stories using a single anonymous source.
  Last month, three CNN employees resigned for their role in a botched 
Trump-Russia story. This debacle revealed the media's insatiable 
appetite to print any story--no matter how groundless--that is critical 
of the President.
  The liberal media should stop fighting the President and start 
covering his Presidency in a fair and unbiased manner. Then they will 
regain the trust of the American people.
