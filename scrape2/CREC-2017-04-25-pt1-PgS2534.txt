  SENATE RESOLUTION 140--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF APRIL 2017 AS 
                    ``PARKINSON'S AWARENESS MONTH''

  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 140

       Whereas Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive 
     neurological disease and is the second most common 
     neurodegenerative disease in the United States;
       Whereas there is inadequate data on the incidence and 
     prevalence of Parkinson's disease, but the disease affects an 
     estimated 1,000,000 individuals in the United States and its 
     prevalence is expected to more than double by 2040;
       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention, Parkinson's disease is the 14th leading cause of 
     death in the United States;
       Whereas every day Parkinson's disease greatly impacts 
     millions of individuals in the United States who are 
     caregivers, family members, and friends of individuals with 
     Parkinson's disease;
       Whereas, although research suggests that the cause of 
     Parkinson's disease is a combination of genetic and 
     environmental factors, the exact cause of the disease in most 
     individuals is still unknown;
       Whereas, as of March 2017, there is no objective test or 
     biomarker for diagnosing Parkinson's disease;
       Whereas there is no known cure or drug to slow or halt the 
     progression of Parkinson's disease, and available treatments 
     are limited in their ability to address the medical needs of 
     patients and remain effective over time;
       Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from 
     person to person and may include--
       (1) tremors;
       (2) slowness of movement and rigidity;
       (3) difficulty with balance and gait;
       (4) disturbances in speech and swallowing;
       (5) cognitive impairment and dementia;
       (6) mood disorders; and
       (7) a variety of other nonmotor symptoms;
       Whereas volunteers, researchers, caregivers, and medical 
     professionals are working to improve the quality of life for 
     individuals living with Parkinson's disease and their 
     families; and
       Whereas increased research, education, and community 
     support services are needed--
       (1) to find more effective treatments; and
       (2) to provide access to quality care for individuals 
     living with Parkinson's disease: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates April 2017 as ``Parkinson's Awareness 
     Month'';
       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness 
     Month;
       (3) continues to support research to find better treatments 
     and a cure for Parkinson's disease;
       (4) recognizes the individuals living with Parkinson's 
     disease who participate in vital clinical trials to advance 
     the knowledge of the disease; and
       (5) commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, 
     researchers, and millions of individuals across the United 
     States working to improve the quality of life for individuals 
     living with Parkinson's disease and their families.
