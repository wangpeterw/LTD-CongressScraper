                   HONORING OFFICER RONALD TARENTINO

  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to 
honor the memory of Officer Ronald Tarentino, who was killed in the 
line of duty on May 22, 2016.
  Last week, the country observed National Police Week, a week in honor 
of the brave law enforcement officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice 
in service to their community. Officer Ronald Tarentino was one of 
those brave officers.
  Officer Tarentino was born in Medford and raised in Medford and 
Tewksbury, MA. The son of a police officer, he followed his father's 
example when he joined the police force, spending 7 years in the 
Leicester Police Department before transferring to the Auburn Police 
Department, where he served until his untimely death 2 years later.
  I had the honor of attending the wake of Officer Tarentino and was 
moved by the stories of his selfless dedication to those around him. 
Officer Tarentino was the coworker everyone loved. His passion for his 
work was easily apparent to anyone who knew him. He came into work with 
a smile and made friends with all of his colleagues. Outside of work, 
he enjoyed fishing, hunting, and archery and was a member of the 
Massachusetts Police Association, the Auburn Elks, and Mustangs or 
Massachusetts.
  Most of all, Officer Tarentino was a loving husband and a father of 
three. Today we honor his service and sacrifice. May his memory 
continue to challenge and inspire us.
