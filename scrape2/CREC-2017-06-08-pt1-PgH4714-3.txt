                    HONORING THE LIFE OF MARY GOSEK

  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a longtime 
central New York ovarian cancer advocate, Mary Gosek, who recently lost 
her own tremendous battle with the horrible disease.
  Through her work as president of the Oswego Chapter of Hope for 
Heather, Mary devoted countless hours to educating women and men 
throughout our community on the symptoms and causes of ovarian cancer. 
Her great passion for finding a cure inspired many and gave hope to 
those who were suffering.
  Mary's strength and determination was most visible in her efforts to 
raise awareness for ovarian cancer. Whether she was working together 
with her husband, Ed, to turn the Oswego State's ice hockey arena teal, 
organizing a teal takeover of the Oswego Speedway, or sharing her own 
experiences in Washington or Albany, Mary was committed to saving 
lives. Her spirit and tenacity in the fight against ovarian cancer will 
always be remembered. May it serve as an inspiration for others.
  In Mary's memory, I will continue to advocate for increased funding 
for research into cures, treatment, and prevention so that we can 
someday know a day free of ovarian cancer. May her name forever be 
remembered in the Congressional Record.
  Rest peacefully, Mary.
