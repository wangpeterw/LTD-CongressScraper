                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, here we are again, mourning the senseless 
loss of life from yet another terrible mass shooting.
  Last Sunday, at their church in Texas, 26 more Americans were cut 
down by a gunman. The oldest was 77 years old. The youngest was 17 
months old.
  This is just a few weeks after Las Vegas endured the deadliest 
shooting in our country's history and in the backdrop of ongoing 
violence in cities, towns, and homes across the country that claims an 
average of 93 lives each and every day.
  The response from this Chamber is deafening silence.
  Mr. Speaker, how can we face this epidemic without even a debate?
  I am open to any commonsense idea to make progress on this issue, 
from universal background checks to limiting access to high-capacity 
magazines and military-style assault weapons.
  I have introduced legislation to help prevent theft from the Federal 
Firearm Licensees, expand background checks, and close purchase 
monitoring loopholes.
  I know there is no one single solution, but we cannot allow this 
epidemic to continue without even a discussion on what we can do. 
Together, we have the opportunity to save lives.
  I urge my colleagues to act.
