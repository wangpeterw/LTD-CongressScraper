                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the families 
that are feeling the burden of ObamaCare.
  Premiums have skyrocketed an average of 19 percent in our State, and 
insurers are fleeing the market left and right. In fact, 73 percent of 
counties in Florida only have one insurance provider, leaving people 
with higher costs and less choice when it comes to their health care. 
That is why the President's healthcare law has failed the people of 
Florida.
  Now, Republicans are offering up solid solutions to make our Nation's 
healthcare system work for everyone, without pulling the rug from 
anybody's feet. We are focused on a more affordable, more personalized 
healthcare plan that empowers patients, not Washington.
  I am proud to serve on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee as 
we begin our first steps this week to bring relief to the people of 
Florida and our Nation.
