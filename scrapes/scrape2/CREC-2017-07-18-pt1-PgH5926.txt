                    NELSON MANDELA INTERNATIONAL DAY

  (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great 
pride to join millions of people around the world to honor the life and 
legacy of South African President Nelson Mandela on Nelson Mandela 
International Day. I submitted comments for the Record this morning, 
but I would like to highlight a few key points.
  In his 95 years of life, President Mandela was a transformative 
leader who forever changed the world through his steadfast dedication 
to freedom, equality, and human rights.
  After spending 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela became the first 
Black South African to be elected President and used his administration 
to dismantle apartheid, combat institutional racism, and begin the 
process of racial reconciliation in his country.
  To me, however, Nelson Mandela was more than a world-renowned leader. 
I had the distinct honor and privilege of calling him a friend. His 
courageous leadership in the antiapartheid movement encouraged me to 
join in the fight, which, to this day, is one of the most defining 
moments of my life.
  We will forever be indebted to Nelson Mandela, who taught the world 
the power of one man having the fortitude to sacrifice his own ideals 
for a cause greater than himself.
