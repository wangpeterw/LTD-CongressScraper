                         TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL OWEN

 Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Samuel Owen for his hard work 
as an intern in my Cheyenne office. I recognize his efforts and 
contributions to my office as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Samuel is a native of Columbus, OH, and is a junior at the University 
of Wyoming. He is studying finance and energy development and 
management. He has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made him 
an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of his work is reflected 
in his great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Samuel for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
