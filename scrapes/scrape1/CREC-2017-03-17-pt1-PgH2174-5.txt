                  WE CANNOT LEAVE OUR VETERANS BEHIND

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our veterans who have 
served in our country's Armed Forces.
  For over 240 years, millions of brave souls have fought, bled, and 
some have died, to defend our American freedom. The Bible says: 
``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for 
his friends.''
  Mr. Speaker, the American veteran truly has great love for his fellow 
man. Because of the great sacrifices of our veterans, we must see to 
their care and well-being. We have often failed in this obligation. We 
have left our veterans helpless, suffering through bureaucratic 
nightmares to get care they desperately need.
  The Phoenix Veterans Administration has worked hard to improve its 
care for veterans, and the newly-opened Southeast Veterans Affairs 
Health Care Clinic in Gilbert is intent on providing the best possible 
care for our Nation's finest.
  While conditions have been improving in Phoenix and around the 
Nation, there is still much work to be done. I have made it a priority 
to provide excellent service to the veterans in my district. They 
deserve nothing less.
  Our veterans did not leave us behind. Mr. Speaker, we cannot leave 
them behind.
