                        TRIBUTE TO JANET YELLEN

  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to say a few words about Janet 
Yellen, an outstanding public servant, who recently completed her term 
as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and 
stepped down from the Board. At different times, over 42 years, she 
served the Fed as staff economist, member of the Board, president of 
the San Francisco Fed, Vice Chair, and then Chair. Under her 
leadership, the Fed began the process of normalizing monetary policy by 
winding down its balance sheet and raising interest rates after years 
at the zero lower bound.
  Twice yearly, Ms. Yellen reported to the Banking Committee on 
monetary policy, conscientiously answering questions from members and 
was helpful in enlisting Federal Reserve staff to respond to inquiries 
from committee members and staff. I have appreciated her willingness to 
engage constructively with me and members of the committee as we have 
worked on legislation to tailor regulations and promote a healthy 
economy.
  Over the years, I found Ms. Yellen to be serious, engaging, and 
generous with her time, a sentiment that is widely shared in this body. 
I thank her for her service.
