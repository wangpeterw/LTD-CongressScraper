                       UNKNOWN BUDGETARY EFFECTS

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 4105 of H. Con. Res. 71, the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, makes out of 
order any amendment to a fiscal year 2018 reconciliation measure if the 
amendment has an unknown budgetary effect.
  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I have reviewed S. Amdt. 1846 
and determined that it has an unknown budgetary effect. Therefore, 
section 4105 applies to S. Amdt. 1846. This amendment is susceptible to 
a section 4105 point of order.
