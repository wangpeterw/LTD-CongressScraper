                              GOP TAX SCAM

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, you have been hearing a lot about this tax 
plan, but it is really a tax scam.
  It is not a mistake that congressional Republicans are going after 
hardworking middle class families. In fact, it is an intentional attack 
against them.
  Let me explain briefly. They have laid out a simple three-step 
process. Here they are:
  Step one, pass a tax scam that they know will raise taxes on millions 
of middle class families in order to give tax cuts to corporate special 
interests and billionaires. That alone will saddle our children with 
more than $1 trillion in debt.
  Step two, flip out about this new debt.
  Step three, then demand cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
  For months, congressional Republicans have denied that this is what 
they are doing.
  Well, let me tell you what happened last week. Speaker Ryan said 
this: ``We're going to have to get back next

year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the 
deficit.''
  He says that entitlements are what he is going to go after.
  Well, do you know what entitlements are?
  Medicare and Social Security, under his definition.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this tax scam. Instead, 
let's offer a better deal to the American public.
