     PRESERVING WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS FOR LGBT FEDERAL CONTRACTORS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am heartened by the administration's 
announcement that it will preserve workplace protections for LGBT 
Federal contractors. This is a meaningful and positive step toward 
ending discrimination against hardworking LGBT Americans who only want 
to earn a living and provide for themselves and their families.
  For many years I have been working with my congressional colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to protect skilled, qualified, and motivated 
LGBT employees. Too often these individuals experience rejections at 
job interviews, are denied promotions, or face other types of 
harassment in the workplace simply because of their sexual orientation 
or gender identity.
  This shameful practice of discrimination on the job runs counter to 
our core values of fairness and equality. I hope that the 
administration and Congress can work together to extend equal rights to 
LGBT individuals in every sector.
