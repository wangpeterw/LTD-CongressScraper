                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  As the Congress enters the weekend before the next deadline for 
important legislation, may all Members be inspired and moved to work 
together to settle some of the major issues facing our Nation.
  Give them rest, O God, and may the power of Your truth and our faith 
in Your providence give them all the confidence they must have to do 
the good work required for service to our Nation.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
