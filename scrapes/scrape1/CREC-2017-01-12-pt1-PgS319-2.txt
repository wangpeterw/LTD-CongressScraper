  Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lee,Mr. Scott, and Mr. Cruz) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
on theJudiciary:

                               S. Res. 13

       Whereas, in 1948, Clarence Thomas was born outside 
     ofSavannah, Georgia, in the small community of Pin Point, 
     Georgia;
       Whereas Clarence Thomas was born into poverty and 
     undersegregation;
       Whereas, notwithstanding his humble beginnings and the many 
     impediments he faced, Clarence Thomas demonstratedincredible 
     intellect, discipline, and strength in attending and 
     graduating from St. Benedict the Moor Catholic School, St. 
     JohnVianney Minor Seminar, the College of the Holy Cross, and 
     Yale Law School;
       Whereas Clarence Thomas had a distinguished legalcareer 
     with service in State government and all branches of the 
     Federal Government, including the Senate, the Department 
     ofEducation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and 
     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
     ColumbiaCircuit;
       Whereas, on July 1, 1991, President George Herbert Walker 
     Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justiceof 
     the Supreme Court of the United States (in this preamble 
     referred to as the ``Supreme Court'');
       Whereas Justice Thomas isthe second African American to 
     serve on the Supreme Court;
       Whereas, during his quarter century on the Supreme Court, 
     JusticeThomas has made a unique and indelible contribution to 
     the jurisprudence of the United States;
       Whereas Justice Thomas haspropounded a jurisprudence that 
     seeks to faithfully apply the original meaning of the text of 
     the Constitution of the UnitedStates;
       Whereas Justice Thomas has brought renewed focus to 
     constitutional doctrines that the Framers intended to 
     undergirdour republican form of government, including 
     federalism and the separation of powers;
       Whereas, in fostering this philosophyof law, Justice Thomas 
     reinvigorated not only the jurisprudence of the United 
     States, but also the democracy of the UnitedStates;
       Whereas Justice Thomas has been a remarkably prolific 
     Associate Justice, writing influential opinions on 
     topicsincluding constitutional law, administrative law, and 
     civil rights;
       Whereas, on August 10, 1846, in the name of founding 
     anestablishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, 
     Congress established the Smithsonian Institution as a trust 
     to beadministered by a Board of Regents and a Secretary of 
     the Smithsonian Institution;
       Whereas diversity, including intellectualdiversity, is a 
     core value of the Smithsonian Institution and the museums of 
     the Smithsonian Institution should capitalize onthe richness 
     inherent in differences;
       Whereas, upon opening, the National Museum of African 
     American History and Culture (inthis preamble referred to as 
     the ``Museum'') is the only national museum devoted 
     exclusively to the documentation of AfricanAmerican life, 
     history, and culture;
       Whereas the Museum omits the contribution made by Justice 
     Thomas to the United States;and
       Whereas the Senate is hopeful that the Museum will reflect 
     that important contribution: Now, therefore, beit
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
       (1) Associate Justice Clarence Thomas is ahistorically 
     significant African American who has--
       (A) overcome great challenges;
       (B) served his country honorably formore than 35 years; and
       (C) made an important contribution to the United States, in 
     particular the jurisprudence of theUnited States; and
       (2) the life and work of Justice Thomas are an important 
     part of the story of African Americans in theUnited States 
     and should have a prominent place in the National Museum of 
     African American History and Culture.
