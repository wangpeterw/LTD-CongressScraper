            CONGRATULATING INDIANA STATE SENATOR LUKE KENLEY

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Indiana's 
State Senator Luke Kenley on his retirement, and to thank him for the 
many years he dedicated to serving our fellow Hoosiers.
  From balancing the budget to reforming State taxes, he has worked for 
25 years to empower local communities and strengthen Indiana's economy. 
He led important efforts to enhance our schools, roads, businesses, 
local institutions, and more.
  Senator Kenley's commitment to Hoosier common sense, and his tireless 
efforts to bring our State's economy into the 21st century, helped 
transform Indiana and improve Hoosiers' lives. I am grateful for 
Senator Kenley's leadership and his keen understanding of the Hoosier 
values that are so important to our way of life. I have no doubt his 
impact on our State will last far into the future.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Indiana State 
Senator Luke Kenley the absolute best as he embarks on this next 
chapter in life.
