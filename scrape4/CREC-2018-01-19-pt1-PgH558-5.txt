                          ON DACA AND DREAMERS

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, as Republicans demonstrate their 
inability to fund the Federal Government, 700,000 young people are left 
with an uncertain future. These DREAMers exemplify what is best about 
America. They have served in our military. They have built businesses 
and contributed to our communities.
  This administration has waged an all-out assault on these young 
people, placing them in jeopardy and sowing fear that they will be sent 
back to countries that they do not even know. And now Republicans in 
Congress are turning their back on these young people as well.
  We could have passed a fix to this problem as part of a government 
funding bill. That would have been a bipartisan solution, and it would 
have been supported by the vast majority of the American people.
  Eighty-seven percent of Americans say DREAMers should be allowed to 
stay in the United States, yet President Trump is holding these young 
people hostage for a useless and offensive border wall. This is 
unconscionable.
  We have a moral obligation to act. Congress needs to stay here and 
have an open vote on a clean DREAM Act. That is our moral obligation.
