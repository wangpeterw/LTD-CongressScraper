                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gene Hemick, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer:
  At this sacred time in which Christian and Jewish religions celebrate 
God's loving care, we pray our Congress will be blessed with the 
devoted support God has bestowed on humankind throughout time.
  May the strength of God's compassion sustain our Congress and enable 
it to wisely confront the complex challenges it encounters in guiding 
our country.
  Amen.
