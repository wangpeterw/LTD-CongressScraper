                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Paul D. Holland, S.J., Jesuit Conference, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer:
  Gracious God, winter has come, with its long nights and cold days.
  The holidays bring both hectic demands and the promise of reunions 
and recreation.
  War and dissension continue to plague our world and our own hearts, 
even as heavenly voices cry out for peace on Earth; so we pause and 
seek Your presence, Your light, Your peace.
  Bless each Member of Congress. Through their faithful service to our 
Nation, make them witnesses to hope in the midst of confusion, beacons 
of light in the midst of the dark, and channels of peace amidst 
turmoil.
  Give them safe journeys home, joyful family gatherings, and renewal 
of strength in body, mind, and spirit.
  And most of all, fill their hearts with gratitude and humble 
recognition that You are the source of all hope, all light, and all 
peace.
  We pray this in Your most holy name.
  Amen.
