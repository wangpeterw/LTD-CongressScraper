         AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT IS BAD FOR NEW YORK HOSPITALS

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the GOP's awful, 
irresponsible healthcare bill will impose an age tax on older 
Americans, it will raise your premiums, and it will be absolutely 
disastrous to our Nation's hospitals.
  In my district in New York, our hospitals serve millions of people 
every day, and their budgets are already stretched. The GOP healthcare 
bill will rip away health insurance for over 24 million Americans, 
forcing more people to get care in high-cost emergency rooms while, at 
the same time, cutting billions in Federal funding hospitals need to 
survive.
  New York's hospitals will lose over $1 billion in 2018 alone. With 
uncompensated care already skyrocketing, the 27 New York hospitals that 
are already on a financial distress watch list tell me they may not 
even be able to survive. That is why the Greater New York Hospital 
Association, the Healthcare Association of New York State, and other 
New York health groups are urging all of us to vote ``no'' on this 
terrible GOP bill.
