  CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT 
 MALICIOUS CYBER-ENABLED ACTIVITIES--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
                   UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115-26)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 
of April 1, 2015, is to continue in effect beyond April 1, 2017.
  Significant malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or 
directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside 
the United States, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States. Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 with respect 
to significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.
                                                     Donald J. Trump.  
The White House, March 29, 2017.
