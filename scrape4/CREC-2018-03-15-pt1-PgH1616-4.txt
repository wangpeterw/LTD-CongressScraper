                           CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA

  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today to shine light on 
the ongoing tragedy in Syria.
  Today marks 7 years of civil war in Syria, 7 years of indiscriminate 
killing of women and children, 7 years of intermittent chemical attacks 
on civilians by the Assad regime, 7 years of bombings, of people thrown 
out of their homes, of children whose youth has been stolen from them.
  The ongoing tragedy in eastern Ghouta is just the most recent of 
horrific events perpetrated by the Assad regime and their Iranian-
backed militia.
  The White Helmets group reports that 800 civilians have been killed 
in the past 2 weeks as the Assad regime continues to pound the rebel-
held area, despite the ongoing humanitarian cease-fire.
  The blatant disregard regime forces have for civilian life is nothing 
short of despicable.
  We must continue to be engaged in efforts to support the Syrian 
Democratic Forces and other allies that believe in a free, democratic, 
and independent Syria.
  Without U.S. leadership, the carnage will continue and we will be 
left with meaningless U.N. resolutions. We must stand with our allies 
to stop this devastating carnage that is tearing apart families and 
ruining countless lives.
