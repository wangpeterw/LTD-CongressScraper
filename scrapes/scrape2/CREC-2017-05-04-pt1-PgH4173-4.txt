                HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE

  (Mr. CUMMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago at a townhall in Baltimore, a 
young lady came forward. She was 28 years old. She said: I have stage 
IV cancer. I got married just a few years ago. My husband and I were 
considering having a baby, but now I have discovered that that won't 
happen. The Affordable Care Act saved my life.
  The last thing she said--and she begged--was: You have got to act now 
because, if you don't, I will be dead.
  Mr. Speaker, the last thing I said to her was that I will give it 
everything I have got.
  Just a few moments ago, when I heard the other side of the aisle 
cheer as the bill was passed, it gave me great pain.
  But I want to say to her and to the American people: I will fight 
until my death to make sure that we get you the care that you need.
  Health care is a right, not a privilege.
