                         TAX REFORM ON STUDENTS

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, education is supposed to be the 
great equalizer, but instead of investing in our students, Republicans, 
through their tax scam, are attempting to widen that equality gap.
  Young people want to pursue higher education, and Republicans want to 
punish them with higher taxes so we can give away benefits to 
millionaires and billionaires.
  Students are gaining knowledge that can actually make a difference in 
this world, but the Republicans' tax plan will only serve to deter them 
from that goal.
  It is right here in black and white. Republicans are trying to 
eliminate student loan interest deductions. They want to tax college 
endowments that provide scholarships and student aid. They are taxing 
graduate tuition benefits that would make graduate school unattainable 
for low- and middle-income students.
  So this Republican attack on college and graduate students says loud 
and clear: Low income? No rich parents? Good luck. Pay up.
  It is an absolute disgrace.
