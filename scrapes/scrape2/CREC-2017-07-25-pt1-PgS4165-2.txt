                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, we sing of Your steadfast love and proclaim 
Your faithfulness to all generations. Make us one Nation, truly wise, 
with righteousness exalting us in due season.
  Today, inspire our lawmakers to walk in the light of Your 
countenance. Abide with them so that Your wisdom will influence each 
decision they make. Lord, keep them from evil so that they will not be 
brought to grief, enabling them to avoid the pitfalls that lead to 
ruin. Empower them to glorify You in all they say and do as You fill 
their hearts with thankful praise. May they never fail to acknowledge 
their total dependence upon You.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
