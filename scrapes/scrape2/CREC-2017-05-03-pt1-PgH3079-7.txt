Tourism Week, which runs from May 7 to May 13.
  I grew up in Tarpon Springs, Florida, where our historic sponge 
docks, authentic Greek communities, and beautiful waterways draw 
visitors from around the State, country, and the world.
  As a young kid, I worked in my grandfather's bakery in Tarpon 
Springs, Florida. Many of our customers were tourists coming to sample 
Greek pastries on their visit to Tarpon Springs.
  Today, tourism remains important to businesses in our community. And 
in 2015, both business and leisure travelers spent $2 billion in 
Florida's 12th Congressional District.
  Travel and tourism is one of the largest industries in the United 
States. Last year alone, it generated more than $2.3 trillion in 
economic output, and it is responsible for 15.3 million jobs 
nationwide.
  In honor of National Travel and Tourism Week, I thank the people who 
work each day to welcome travelers and keep this important industry 
strong.
