                CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JESUS A. PERMUY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my 
constituent, Jesus A. Permuy, for a lifetime of service to our south 
Florida community and to the cause of liberty in my native homeland of 
Cuba.
  Like my family and me and so many others in my congressional 
district, Jesus was forced to flee Castro's brutal tyranny. Jesus 
embraced his new life here in the United States and became involved in 
numerous civic and community affairs while working to restore freedom 
and democracy in Cuba.
  In 1976, Jesus secured accreditation for the Christian Democratic 
Movement of Cuba to speak before the U.N. Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva.
  For decades, Mr. Permuy has been involved in a number of human rights 
advocacy organizations denouncing the systemic repression brought upon 
the Cuban people by the evil Castro regime. Jesus founded the Center 
for Human Rights in Miami. He is a dedicated husband, a proud father of 
8 children, and a grandfather of 11 grandchildren. Jesus is a shining 
example to us all.
  Thank you, Jesus A. Permuy, for your service to our community and to 
my native Cuba.
