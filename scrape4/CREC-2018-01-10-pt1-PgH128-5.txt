                     NON-METRO AREA AGENCY ON AGING

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, a few years 
ago, New Mexico decimated its behavioral health system when it 
terminated nearly every behavioral health provider in the State.
  In fact, thousands of New Mexicans did not have access to medicine, 
counselors, or treatment, increasing their risks of substance abuse, 
health issues, and homelessness.
  Many New Mexicans suffered, were incarcerated, or died because of the 
State's negligence. Today, we are potentially seeing an even more 
catastrophic State-created crisis in the making.
  Just a few weeks ago, the State announced it intended to cancel its 
contract with the Non-Metro Area Agency on Aging, which manages and 
oversees critical services like adult daycare, meal services, 
caregiving, transportation, and respite care for vulnerable seniors and 
their families.
  Decimating the current system without public hearings, due process, 
or having a public plan to ensure the continuity of services will 
disrupt these lifesaving safety net programs that serve nearly 80,000 
seniors; and these seniors are going to suffer because of this reckless 
and hasty decision.
  I have written to HHS demanding that they immediately investigate the 
State's negligent behavior.
