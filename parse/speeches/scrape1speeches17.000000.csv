It has been 44 years since Roe v. Since then, 58 million precious American lives have been aborted. The Supreme Court got it wrong when it violated its authority by creating a constitutional right to abortion. To make matters worse, the Federal Government is now using our taxpayer dollars to subsidize these abortions. Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to put a stop to this. This is an area in which the Constitution, my constituents, and my conviction will not allow me to budge.  I believe that all life is ordained by God and begins at conception, as the psalmists so eloquently said: ``for You created my inward parts. You knit me together in my mother's womb.'' Our Constitution clearly defines that all Americans--even those who cannot vote, who cannot speak or defend themselves--have the same right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of H.7; but, most importantly, I plead with them to stand up for generations of Americans yet unborn.

13294,topic-id,1209,"Mr.President, I am proud to have a chance to speak in support of your fellow Coloradan, Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme  Clearly, we all understand this is an important decision and an important institution. The Supreme Court is the only Court specified in the Constitution and often the final arbiter of how the Constitution and the law is to be applied. In the history of the Court, in the history of the country, only 112 individuals have had the honor to serve on the Supreme As we debate the qualifications and qualities of the person who has been nominated, and I hope to see confirmed as the 113th person to serve as an Associate Justice or a Justice on the Court, it is really vital we understand that we have a nominee who has a deep understanding and appreciation of the role of the Court and the role the Court plays in our democracy.  Judge Gorsuch embodies these principles through a lifetime of service, and he has really prepared himself in many unique ways for this moment. He graduated from Columbia University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and earned his law degree from Harvard Law After law school, Judge Gorsuch served as a Supreme Court clerk to two different Justices, Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony It has been pointed out that if Judge Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on the Court, he will be the first person ever to serve with someone for whom he clerked, and hopefully he and Justice Kennedy will have an opportunity to serve together.  After clerking on the Court, he went on to a successful career in private law[[Page S555]]practice, spending 10 years litigating a broad range of complex trials and appeals.  In 2004, just in case his Harvard law degree wasn't enough, as a Marshall scholar, he received a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford  At every point in his preparation, it has been understood he was at the top of that preparatory activity. He has served his country in the Justice Department, working as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney In 2006, 10 years ago, President George Bush nominated him to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of At the time of his nomination, the American Bar Association gave him a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating, the highest rating. The Senate then confirmed his nomination unanimously by a voice vote.  Today I believe the Senate has 11 Democrats serving with us who were part of that unanimous process. In his decade on the Tenth U.Circuit Court of Appeals bench, Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to upholding the rule of law and interpreting the Constitution as its authors intended.  I am confident he will continue to adhere to the Constitution, apply the rule of law, and not legislate from the bench. I think he understands, as Justice Scalia did, that the job of a Justice of the Supreme Court is not to decide what the law should be or what the Constitution, in their opinion, should say but decide what the law is and what the Constitution does say.  His keen intellect and devotion to law are very well understood and appreciated throughout the legal profession. He has the integrity, the professional qualifications, and the judicial temperament to serve on the Nation's highest  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial from earlier this week.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Denver Post, 26, 2017]     Trump Would Do Well to Consider Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court                        (By the Editorial Board)       Then-U.Ken Salazar, right, introduces Neil Gorsuch      at his nomination hearing to the U.Court of Appeals for      the 10th Circuit on June 21, 2006. Gorsuch is being      considered as a possibly replacement for the late U.     Supreme Court justice Antonin       President Donald Trump is on the verge of making his most      enduring appointment to date and we are encouraged by one of      the names on his list to replace former Supreme Court Justice      Antonin       Neil Gorsuch is a federal judge in Denver with Western      roots and a reputation for being a brilliant legal mind and      talented writer. Those who have followed Gorsuch's career say      that from his bench in the U.10th Circuit Court of Appeals      he has applied the law fairly and consistently, even issuing      provocative challenges to the Supreme Court to consider his      rulings.       Liberals who dreamed of a less-conservative Merrick Garland      on the court will undoubtedly gasp at a suggestion that      Gorsuch would be a good addition to a court that has been      shorthanded for more than a year.       Gorsuch is most widely known for ruling in the Hobby Lobby      contraception case before it reached the Supreme Court in      2014. His controversial decision was upheld in a 5-4 vote.      Gorsuch wrote in the case that those with ``sincerely held      religious beliefs'' should not be forced to participate in      something ``their religion teaches them to be gravely      wrong.''       We disagreed with that ruling, saying the Supreme Court      wrongly applied constitutional protections of religious      freedom to a corporation that remained owned by a small group      of like-minded individuals.       We argued that even closely held corporations--primarily      functioning as money-making entities and not religious      institutions--shouldn't be able to opt out of the Affordable      Care Act mandate that insurance cover contraception by citing      First Amendment protections intended for individuals and      churches.       But in considering Gorsuch's body of work and reputation--     and yes, we like his ties to Colorado as well--we hope Trump      gives him the nod.       We are not afraid of a judge who strictly interprets the      Constitution based solely on the language and intent of our      nation's founders, as long as he is willing to be consistent      even when those rulings conflict with his own beliefs.       As Denver Attorney Jason Dunn, who considers himself a      longtime fan of Gorsuch, explains, his views stem ``from a      belief in a separation of powers and in a judicial modesty      that it is not in the role of the courts to make law. Justice      Scalia would put it: If you like every one of your rulings,      you're probably doing it wrong.''       A justice who does his best to interpret the Constitution      or statute and apply the law of the land without prejudice      could go fair to restore faith in the highest court of the      land. That faith has wavered under the manufactured and false      rhetoric from critics that the high court has become a      corrupt body stacked with liberals. And while Democrats will      surely be tempted to criticize the nomination of anyone Trump      appoints, they'd be wise to take the high road and look at      qualifications and legal consistency rather than political      leanings.       Gorsuch, at 49, will have years to whittle away at that      damaging lack of trust. A July 2016 Gallup Poll found that 52      percent of Americans disapproved of the way the Supreme Court      handled its job. The finding is striking, considering the      same poll in 2000 found only 29 percent of Americans      disapproved.       We could do far worse than a thoughtful graduate from      Columbia, Harvard and Oxford universities, who clerked for      two Supreme Court justices and calls Denver home.

13441,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, I rise today to reintroduce the Law Enforcement Officers' Equity This good-government bill will provide Federal law enforcement officers with the Federal benefits they deserve for their service. I thank Senator Rob Portman for being an original cosponsor of this bill.  There is perhaps no harder job in the United States than that of law enforcement officers. Each day, brave men and women work under tremendously stressful conditions to keep our communities safe. From apprehending violent criminals to arresting drug kingpins, these brave men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for a higher cause. We owe them our sincerest gratitude for their service.  Due to the high level of training required for their job and the ever-present danger in their profession, Congress determined that Federal law enforcement officers should receive higher salaries and enhanced benefits compared to other Federal employees. Unfortunately, due to a technical error,[[Page S1307]]nearly 30,000 Federal law enforcement officers classified as G5-0083 police officers do not receive enhanced benefits under the United States As a result, certain officers who work for Federal agencies--such as the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.Postal Service, U.Mint, National Institute of Health and many more--receive lower pensions as compared to other law enforcement officers with similar responsibilities. It makes no sense that postal police officers or any other Federal law enforcement officers receive less benefits even though they have the similar duties and functions as other law enforcement officers.  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would fill in this gap in the law and expand the number of Federal law enforcement officers who can receive benefits. The bill would expand the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for retirement purposes to include all Federal law enforcement officers. The change would grant law enforcement officer status to the following individuals: employees who are authorized to carry a firearm and whose duties include the investigation or apprehension of suspected criminals; employees of the Internal Revenue Service whose duties are primarily the collection of delinquent taxes and securing delinquent returns; employees of the U.S Postal Inspection Service; and employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs who are Department police offices. These officers face the same risks and challenges as the men and women currently classified properly under Federal law as law  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would allow incumbent law enforcement officers' Federal service--after the enactment of the act--to be considered service performed as a law enforcement officer for retirement purposes.  This legislation has the support of law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Association, and the Law Enforcement Action  Fundamental fairness demands that we close this loophole in Federal law and give all Federal law enforcement officers the retirement benefits they deserve-Trask my colleagues to support the Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act, and I urge its speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By Mr.McCONNELL (for himself and Mr.Paul):  429.

After reaching out to the Department, I came to realize that this is a common problem around the country, which led to my introduction of the amendment.  Under the current VA system, the Secretary is allowed to appoint an interim director at facilities, but those individuals can only serve a maximum of 240 days.

13243,topic-id,663,"Mr.President, nearly 70 years ago today, the United States and 11 other nations--in the face of Soviet aggression--joined together in mutual defense to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Since its inception, NATO has expanded to 28 member nations. The breadth of its mission is impressive--from ensuring regional stability and combating terrorism to training partner countries and supporting humanitarian aid. While NATO was founded to ensure Western peace and stability in the face of the Cold War, its work has come to encompass all corners and peoples of the globe.  NATO is more important than ever today in deterring regional conflict The U.must stand by its ironclad commitment to NATO's security and solidarity as Russian President Vladimir Putin flouts international law and exerts Russian aggression around the world, from meddling in our own election to the illegal annexation of  Our NATO allies need our support. I applaud Operation Atlantic Resolve, which coordinates the deployment of additional NATO troops to our allies in Eastern I also commend other U.efforts that support our NATO allies, like the European Reassurance These play an essential role in bolstering our force readiness in the region to deter Russian aggression and demonstrate our commitment to the common cause and democratic principles that NATO embodies.  American support for NATO is and must remain steadfast. The nearly unanimous vote in the Senate ratifying Montenegro's accession to be a member state is evidence of this well-established, deeply founded support.[[Page S2213]]Ukraine's stated intention to achieve the criteria for joining NATO, too, is testament to the organization's renewed importance in our deterrence policy in the region.  While the sentiment of NATO's article 5--``an attack on one is an attack on all''--helped guide the U.stably through the Cold War, NATO has remained a relevant source of stength for the international community, beyond regional deterrence. Since 1999, when NATO identified the risk international terrorism posed for member nations, the organization has remained a steadfast resource in the fight against terrorism. In fact, the only instance in which article 5 was invoked was in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Since then, NATO has helped ensure freedom of navigation in waters plagued by piracy, helped train Iraqi security forces counter improvised explosive devices, commanded counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan for more than a decade, provided support for Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, and innumerable other contributions. As threats to member nations evolved in the 21st century, NATO demonstrated its ability to adapt.  NATO showed the power of strength through solidarity, not only for its member nations, but also for its dozens of partner nations around the globe. The power of NATO's partnerships lends strength to the global community as a whole, better equipping regions of the world to respond when disaster strikes. Programs like NATO's Centres of Excellence help partner countries fight corruption, piracy, and terrorism and collaborate to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction and other arms. By serving as a resource for nonmember countries, NATO not only strengthens the resolve of the international community to strife and instability, but also serves as a beacon for democratic values like gender equality and rule of law.  Finally, NATO has long served as a force for human rights. It was central to ending the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, and it helped bring an end to violence in Kosovo in 1999. NATO has served as a vital resource assisting with the waves of refugees escaping from violence and atrocity in Syria, and the organization has been at the frontlines to combat international human trafficking.  NATO plays a critical role in combatting increased Russian aggression, but its mission is much broader than that. The world is a safer place thanks to NATO, from stemming regional conflicts, to assisting partners around the world. It serves as an indispensable, indisputable resource for the international community. As we celebrate the anniversary of this pivotal organization today, we must remain committed to its successful future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2212-2.txt,2106,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,4.0,March

My amendment strengthens this important bill, guaranteeing that the Department of Veterans Affairs can employ the best people to care for our veterans.

The VA is run by hardworking civil servants, men and women hired in a competitive, merit-based process that assessed their skill and their passion for serving our Nation's veterans.  Political appointees, on the other hand, are meant to serve their appointing President's agenda for a temporary period of time. Part of their duty to the Nation is to know when it is time to step down from their position of power.

13291,topic-id,2343,"Mr.President, I take this time to talk about the Republican American Health Care Act that was released, I guess, about a week or two ago, affectionately known as I start by saying, what is this legislation trying to achieve? When I listen to the Republicans talk about why they have introduced this bill, what their concern is with the Affordable Care Act, they usually mention their 1 concern is to deal with the increased premium costs that Americans have had under the Affordable Care They normally will point to the individual marketplace, where we have seen increases in premium costs as the market has adjusted to the ratings of those who entered the individual marketplace.  So it was very interesting, as I took a look at the Congressional Budget Office analysis of what the Republican TrumpCare bill would do. The Congressional Budget Office, let me remind my colleagues, is the objective scorekeeper. The leader of the Congressional Budget Office was appointed by the Republican leadership. It is the professional career people who make their best judgment of the impact of legislation that we are considering.  Remember, the Republicans have said their principal objective is to bring down the cost, particularly for those entering the individual marketplace, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2018-19, the average rate in the individual marketplace will increase by 15 to 20 percent. Let me say that again. The Congressional Budget Office tells us the premium increases under TrumpCare will increase for the individual 15 to 20 percent.  Now, that could be a lot higher. That is the average. So let me give you the number. If you happen to be 64 years of age, with an income of $26,500, under the Affordable Care Act, you would pay $1,700 in premiums. Under TrumpCare, you would pay $14,600, or a 750-percent increase. That would equal to about 55 percent of your income in the health insurance premiums. Obviously, that is not affordable. A person of that age and income would have no ability to purchase insurance at an affordable rate under the American Health Care Act or  Let me take a look at some other reasons why we may be looking at this repeal-and-replacement bill. I listened to the I listened to my colleagues, and they say, first, they want to make sure they do no harm, that everyone will be at least as well off as they are today, and that there would be more choice to the consumers in buying health insurance.  Once again, I point to the Congressional Budget Office, the objective scorekeepers. What would happen if TrumpCare were enacted? What would happen as far as individuals who currently have health insurance today? According to the Congressional Budget Office, next year, 2018, there would be 14 million less people insured than there are under the Affordable Care If you project that out to 2026, they indicate there would be 24 million more people who would lose their insurance.  Let me quote from The Baltimore Sun in this morning's editorial, where they pointed out that number: Twenty-four million would equal all the residents of Utah, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nevada, Kansas, Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming combined would have no insurance coverage. That is what 24 million represent in Clearly, this bill is not carrying out the commitment to do no harm because 24 million more Americans will certainly be in worse shape.  Then I heard the President talk about the fact that he wants to do no harm to the Medicare Program or the Medicaid I took a look again at what this bill does in regard to Medicare because the bill repeals the tax on high income; that is, there is currently in law a tax for unearned income above $250,000, a tax that goes into the Medicare trust fund, Part The TrumpCare repeals that tax. Therefore, the Medicare trust fund doesn't get the income. That would reduce the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years, jeopardizing the Medicare system. Clearly, if this bill was aimed at not hurting Medicare, it hasn't achieved that purpose.  Let's talk a little about What does this bill do to Medicaid? According to the Congressional Budget Office, it shifts hundreds of billions of dollars from the Federal Government to our Our States clearly cannot handle that. I have heard from my I am sure my colleagues heard from our other There is no possibility that they could pick up that. The Medicaid Program will be in very serious jeopardy of being able to continue anything like it is today. For Maryland--the State I have the honor of representing--the passage of TrumpCare would jeopardize the over 289,000 Marylanders who have received insurance coverage as a result of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care They very well would lose their coverage.  What does that mean? Well, they better stay well because they are not going to get preventive healthcare covered by insurance. They are less likely to get their preventive healthcare services and the screenings, and, yes, they will return once again to use the emergency room of hospitals as their last resort in order to get their family's healthcare needs met--the most expensive way to get healthcare in our  With the elimination of essential health benefits for Medicaid expansion enrollees, what does that mean? That means the Medicaid population--which in Maryland is hundreds of thousands of people--would lose their essential health benefits, which includes mental health and addiction services.  We are in the midst of an opioid drug addiction epidemic in I have traveled my entire State and have had roundtables with law enforcement and health officials, and they tell me about the growing number of addictions in their community. One of the things they need to do is to be able to get people care and treatment, and we are saying we are going to cut off treatment for millions of That is what TrumpCare would do, cutting off those benefits.  This bill would shift costs. What do I mean by that? Well, it adds costs to the healthcare system. If an individual stays healthy and uses our healthcare system the way they should, it is a lot less costly than entering our healthcare system in a more acute fashion or using our emergency rooms rather than using healthcare providers who are a lot less expensive and more efficient.  So we are going to add to the cost of our healthcare system because of inefficiencies. Many times that extra cost is not paid for by those who have no health insurance; the fact is, it becomes part of what we call uncompensated care. We had that before the Affordable Care With the increase in uncompensated care, all of us who have insurance will pay more because we are going to pay for the people who don't have health insurance, who use the healthcare system and don't pay for the healthcare system. That is a formula for extra costs for all of us.  This legislation would be an attack on women's healthcare. It would attack and eliminate not only the funding for Planned Parenthood, which is critically important in many parts of our country where they are the only healthcare provider for women's healthcare needs, but also eliminate essential health benefits for Medicaid expansion enrollees, which include maternal health. Those guarantees that exist today would no longer be there. With the pressure on the States, it is unlikely that they would be able to maintain the same degree of coverage for our women. Women are more likely to be vulnerable and on  It is an attack on our elderly. I have already talked about Medicare solvency, reducing Medicare solvency by 3 years, but there are more attacks than that. Over half--I think it is 60 to 65 percent of the cost of Medicaid goes to senior care, long-term care or to care[[Page S1827]]for individuals with disabilities. Most families in America get their costs covered for long-term care through The States are not going to be able to maintain the same level of coverage with the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal funds. Our seniors and individuals with disabilities will be in jeopardy of losing a lot of their long-term care coverage.  The legislation, TrumpCare, increases the loss ratios for older people from 3 to 1 to 5 to 1. That increases the cost dramatically for older That is one of the reasons the AARP opposes the legislation. Let me quote them:       This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability,      dramatically increase healthcare costs for Americans age 50      to 64, and put at risk the healthcare of millions of children      and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on      the Medicaid program for long-term care services and support      and other benefits.  That is I already talked about the Congressional Budget Office being a neutral observer. The AARP, of course, is interested in what impact it has on our elderly population. They very clearly say that they are being put at risk.  Let me also talk about affordability. When you have a person who can no longer afford coverage--I already mentioned that person 64 years of age who would have to pay 55 percent of their income in order to get health coverage. That person can't afford coverage. Let's say that person is relatively healthy, so they go without insurance. Well, they need insurance. Maybe someone is young and decides not to get health coverage; they will get it when they need it. There is a 30-percent surtax if you don't keep insurance. That is going to keep people out of the health insurance marketplace who desperately need healthcare.  Once again I am going to quote from the Sun paper. The Baltimore Sun really summed it up fairly well, particularly with their attack on the Congressional Budget I think that is a very unfair attack. We all obviously take issue at times with the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, but it is the objective scorekeeper. It has the most accurate assessments we get on legislation we consider here. That is why we created the Congressional Budget Office--to give us that advice.  The Sun paper, in their editorial this morning, said:       Small wonder that President Donald Trump and certain      Republican leaders were busy bad-mouthing the CBO even before      its report came out. The last thing they needed is the      nonpartisan number crunchers to offer an informed view      instead of the usual political caterwauling about the      ``failings'' of the Affordable Care And this is      particularly rich: Republicans say the CBO blew ObamaCare      estimates years ago when it was circumstances well beyond the      CBO's control that caused analysts to incorrectly predict      ObamaCare enrollment. Should analysts have expected the      Supreme Court to deem the Medicaid expansion optional and      GOP-controlled States to refuse to accept it? Were they      mistaken to assume Congress could actually follow the law and      fund programs to stabilize state insurance exchanges?       Might the CBO be off-target again? But it's at      least as likely that the office is low-balling the most      damaging effects of TrumpCare as it is potentially over-     stating the harm. The Congressional Budget Office is as close      to an umpire as exists in It has certainly been a      lot more on target than the Trump administration, which has      consistently misled Americans on almost everything from the      definition of ``wiretapping'' to the claims of ``millions of      illegal voters'' casting ballots in the last election. Even      those overstated ObamaCare enrollment estimates were closer      to being on the nose than those produced by the CBO's fellow      forecasters at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services      and RAND       Once again, Mr.Trump and his minions have been caught      making up facts. The President promised the ObamaCare      replacement would provide insurance for everyone and it would      be less expensive. Nobody can make that claim about      As the CBO points out, premiums will rise 15-20      percent overall for the first two years, and more for older       The American public expects us to work together to improve our healthcare system. Instead of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with this legislation that will put us in much worse shape, we should be looking at how we can build on the progress we have made under the Affordable Care  Yes, we can bring down costs. Let's bring down costs by taking on the cost of prescription drugs. We know that Americans overpay on prescription drugs. There is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass legislation using America's buying power to help our consumers pay less for prescription costs.  Yes, we should have more competition with insurance carriers. Why not have a public option and see how well the private companies can compete with a public option?  Yes, we can improve the way we deliver care and make it more cost-effective. We, in a bipartisan manner, went down that path in the last Congress under the Comprehensive Recovery and Addiction Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, where we looked at ways that we can collaborate on care for addiction services and mental health so people can get the care they need in the setting they need, whether it is an emergency room or a primary care physician's office.  We have made progress making our healthcare system more cost-effective and efficient. That is what we should be doing--building on the Affordable Care Act rather than taking away critically important benefits. The Republican plan moves us in the wrong direction, and it should be rejected.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Flake). The clerk will call the roll.

Founded to offer education and opportunity to formerly enslaved African Americans, HBCUs have been central institutions in African-American communities for generations.

In 1880, Bishop William Dickerson sought to relocate the college to Columbia and acquired land on which the campus sits today. The institution was renamed Allen University after Richard Allen, the founder and first bishop of the AME  Higher education remained segregated in South Carolina until the early 1960s. The University of South Carolina, also in my district, only a mile away from Allen, for example, admitted its first African American in 1963, 2 years after I graduated college.  Throughout the Jim Crow era, Allen University offered degrees in law, education, and theology, and at one time also offered elementary and high school classes.  Several of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, forming the Allen University Historic Arnett Hall, the oldest building on campus, was constructed in 1891 by the students themselves. It was named after Benjamin Arnett, an early leader of the AME Church, who served on Allen University's Board of  The Chappelle Administration Building, which houses the Chappelle Auditorium, was designed by John Anderson Lankford, known as the dean of Black architects, and completed in 1925.

Chappelle Auditorium is one of five buildings in Columbia designated a National Historic  This historic campus has been central to the Waverly neighborhood and the African-American community in Black artists, such as Leontyne Price, Langston Hughes, and Brook Benton, all appeared at Chappelle  In 1947, the Reverend James Hinton, then-president of the NAACP of South Carolina, held a rally at Chappelle, which was attended by Reverend Joseph DeLaine, an Allen University alumnus.

In the early 1960s, Allen University students led demonstrations at segregated lunch counters and participated in many of the marches in Columbia during that period. National leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, and Ralph Abernathy visited Allen during these demonstrations, often staying on campus when they came to town.  Today Allen University is a liberal arts institution still operated by the AME It has graduated many notable elected officials, including State Representative William Clyburn and his wife, Beverly Dozier Clyburn, who retired from the Aiken, South Carolina, City Council several years ago. Retired State Senator Kay Patterson is also a graduate.

13257,topic-id,447,"Mr.President, I am once again delighted to join my colleague, Senator Patty Murray, to introduce the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act of 2017. Our bill would greatly expand eligibility for VA caregiver support services by including veterans from all eras, allow veterans to transfer their post 9/11 GI bill benefits to their dependents, expand eligibility for the VA caregivers program to include a wider range of injuries that may have previously gone unrecognized, and provide crucial support for our Nation's caregivers themselves.  In 2014, my former colleague and friend, Senator Elizabeth Dole, commissioned a study by the RAND Corporation to learn more about the military caregiver population and explore common issues experienced by America's caregivers. The experts at RAND found that those caring for our servicemembers and veterans provide nearly $14 billion worth of unpaid services every year--an incredible cost that would otherwise be passed on to the  There are more than 5.5 million military caregivers in the United States, and of those, 1.1 million are caring for post-9/11 veterans. These are spouses, parents, children, and other loved ones who have voluntarily put their lives on hold to provide our returning servicemembers with a trusted continuum of care that could not be replicated without them. Many of them will provide this care for years, if not decades, to come.  Tragically, caring for those suffering from the scars of war takes an enormous toll. According to the RAND study, military caregivers face increased instances of mental and physical health problems, chronic absenteeism from work, deteriorating personal relationships, legal and financial troubles, and feelings of isolation. These difficulties are often more pronounced for post-9/11 military caregivers.  Our Nation owes America's veterans our deepest gratitude. Their sacrifices are often very visible. In many cases our veterans have earned medals or awards for their bravery that they can wear proudly on their chest. But our military and veteran caregivers truly are hidden heroes, serving alongside our veterans to provide the love, care, and support they need. Despite their enormous sacrifice, these hidden heroes often do not receive the awards and admiration. That does not mean that they don't deserve it. We must honor our commitment to veterans by answering the call to better support those caring for our wounded, ill, and injured warriors.

13262,topic-id,838,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce the Fire Sprinkler Incentive I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, in introducing this bipartisan bill.  In the United States, the annual cost of fires is enormous. In 2015, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), fires resulted in approximately $14 billion in direct property loss. In addition, more than 3,000 civilians were killed and more than 15,000 people were injured in fires. The NFPA also reports that a fire department responded to a structure fire every 63 seconds.  These statistics are of particular concern in Maine, which has some of the oldest housing stock in the country and which has experienced deadly apartment building fires. In 2014, an apartment fire resulted in the deaths of six people--Maine's deadliest fire in nearly four decades.  Historically, Maine has also seen commercial property damaged by fires. In fact, much of the construction in the historic areas of Portland was done following a devastating fire in 1866. This fire destroyed a third of the city, including most of Portland's commercial buildings, many of its churches, and countless homes.  The NFPA reports that when fire sprinklers are present during a large fire, they are effective 96 percent of the time, saving billions of dollars in property damage but more importantly, thousands of lives. Our bill would encourage commercial building owners to invest in fire safety upgrades. While building codes require sprinklers in new commercial buildings, a great number of structures across the U.were built and put in service before sprinklers were required.  Small business building owners, however, may find it difficult to fund retrofit sprinklers. To help these owners, our bill would provide two tax incentives to encourage them to make this lifesaving investment.  Currently, commercial building owners must depreciate fire sprinkler retrofits over a lengthy 39-year period. The period for residential buildings is 7\1/2\ years. This bill reclassifies fire sprinkler retrofits as 15-year depreciable property, thus allowing building owners to write off their costs more quickly. The bill also provides an option for certain small businesses to deduct the cost of the fire system upgrades immediately under Section 179 of the tax code. Together, these proposals will provide a strong incentive for building owners to install fire sprinkler systems.  This bill was originally drafted in response to the deadly nightclub fire in West Warwick, RI, in 2003, which killed a staggering 100 people. That building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Let us work together to lessen the chances of another tragedy like this one. I invite my colleagues to join Senator Carper and me in support of this bipartisan, common sense legislation.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the  There being no objection, the letter of support was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         International Association                                               of Fire Chiefs,                                       Fairfax, VA, March 6, 2017.     Susan Collins,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 12,000      chief fire and emergency service officers of the      International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), thank you      for introducing the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act (FSIA). The      IAFC appreciates your leadership in creating an incentive for      property owners to retrofit their properties with automatic      fire sprinkler systems. If passed, the FSIA will be an      important tool to save lives in the future.       Fires continue to be a devastating problem in Maine and      across the United According to the National Fire      Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 alone, there were more      than 1.3 million fires in the United States which resulted in      nearly 3,300 civilian deaths, 15,700 civilian injuries, and      $14.3 billion in property damage. Additionally, the U.Fire      Administration reports that the relative risk of fire death      in Maine is 1.5 times higher than the U.average. Fire      sprinkler systems play a crucial role by significantly      increasing the chances of surviving a fire and reducing      property damages. The NFPA found that a fire sprinkler system      decreases the likelihood of dying in a fire by 83%, reduces      property damage by 74%, and confines a fire to its room of      origin in 95% of instances. Incentivizing fire sprinkler      systems simply makes sense from both life safety and public      policy perspectives.[[Page S1749]]       Despite the clear benefits of fire sprinkler systems, the      current tax code fails to incentivize these lifesaving      systems. Your legislation would fix this oversight by      classifying fire sprinkler systems as Section 179 expenses      and allowing property owners to deduct the cost of      retrofitting their buildings. Additionally, the FSIA will      allow high-rise building owners to depreciate the costs of      these systems much faster than the current tax code allows.      The FSIA provides a real incentive for building owners to      protect not only their properties but the lives of those      people inside them.

To begin with, this measure would, believe it or not,empower our Federal legislature to undo virtually every regulation submitted to the Congress since mid-June of last year throughthe end of 2016 last year.

This presents anumber of problems.                              {time}  1345  As the administration has stated, witha threat of veto of an identical bill that was considered last November, the legislation ``would create tremendous regulatoryuncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for applying sound regulatoryprinciples to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other critical aspects of society.''  This, in my view, isa cynical way of trying to legislate. For those concerned about the continued improvement of clean air and clean water, if wecare about the safety of the toys we give our children, if we care about the environment, then we must oppose this bill.  Iurge my colleagues to join me. There hasn't been any deliberative process on the bill recently. It is amazing to me that we havesuch opposition to the bill. It would be overwhelming to put in the over 150 labor organizations, consumer organizations,environmental organizations, and others who have openly asked us to oppose this bill.  If that isn't enough, we have thebusiness community itself in opposition. The American Sustainable Business Council, which represents over 200,000 businesses--andI have a partial list of them--also opposes this measure. It is one of the rare instances in which I have brought to the floorlegislation that is opposed by both labor and by business as well.  It is a little bit of an insult that this bill is beingconsidered, on top of that, under a closed rule. There can be no amendments to this measure.  I am in a state of surprisethat on the second day of a new Congress we would come forward with a measure that could potentially jeopardize public healthand safety in so many different ways.  I think that the opposition to this measure is so overwhelming that I am surprisedthat without hearings, without an opportunity for amendment, we are now considering a measure that has this much opposition.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Consumer Reports dated January 3, 2017.                                             Consumer Reports,                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 2017.     U.House of Representatives,     Washington,      Dear Representative: Consumer Reports and its policy and      mobilization arm, Consumers Union,strongly urge you to vote      no on H.21, the so-called ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.''      This bill would severely undermineaccountability to the      public regarding important protections and safeguards.       Although the rules targeted by this legislationwere      finalized relatively recently, many have been under      development for several years. Consumers Union has provided      publiccomment on several of these regulations that were      designed to protect consumers against unsafe products,      dishonest businessdealings, and other hazards in the      marketplace that place their health, safety, or well-being at      risk. Agency experts carefullyexamined these hazards and      considered various alternative approaches to address them.      They sought input and guidance frombusinesses, consumer      organizations, outside scientific and legal experts, and the      public at[[Page H76]]     large, and ultimately developedfinal rules, explaining      publicly the basis and rationale for the adopted approach.       The federal law known as the CongressionalReview Act (CRA)      already permits a regulation carefully developed over many      years to be erased by Congress, in a rushed processthat does      not reflect the same level of expertise or careful      consideration. Congress could even rescind a rule for reasons      thatmight be based not on any broader interests of the      public, but on the narrower, private special interests of      those seeking toavoid having appropriate obligations imposed      on their profit-making activities.       The potential for the CRA to be employed inthe service of      special interests is at least somewhat held in check by the      fact that the law currently requires separatecongressional      action for erasing each regulation. A regulation considered      for erasure under the CRA must be brought to the Houseand      Senate in its own separate resolution, given its own debate      and vote, and sent to the President for its own signature      orveto. All officials involved in considering whether to      erase the regulation and its protections are thus put on      record, and canbe held accountable for their positions and      the consequences. Perhaps for this reason, there has only      been one regulationrescinded under the CRA in its 20-year      history.       This important accountability check would be removed under      the ``MidnightRules Relief Act.'' By allowing erasure of      multiple regulations en bloc, this bill would enable Members      of Congress and thePresident to evade public accountability      for what Gould be ill-considered, politically motivated      decisions that result indevastating consequences. Under the      bill, no Member would ever have to be on record regarding any      specific regulation beingerased. In fact, any Member who      actually wants to cast a more selective vote, to erase      certain regulations but not others, wouldbe unable to do so.       We are somewhat encouraged that the House Majority, after      initially acting behind closed doors to weakenthe Office of      Congressional Ethics, has reversed course in light of major      concerns raised about the impact on      congressionalaccountability. We urge all Members to also      recognize the damaging effects that this bill would have on      accountability and onthe ability of the American public to      trust their elected representatives. We strongly urge you to      vote no on the ``MidnightRules Relief Act.''           Sincerely,     Laura MacCleery,       Vice President, Consumer Policy and Mobilization Consumer          George Slover,       Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers     William Wallace,       Policy Analyst, Consumers  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from California for pointingout how innocent this measure is, and I am astounded by his feeling that regulations shouldn't be examined one by one. Underthis measure, 61 regulations could be considered en bloc. To me, just trying to put together two regulations to revoke themwould be very, very hard to handle.  What we are talking about here is a bill that would provide special interests with yetanother opportunity to block critical lifesaving regulations, and I want to say I have never had so much opposition to a billbrought to my attention before. 150 environmental organizations, consumer organizations, and labor organizations have urged theMembers of this body to oppose H.21. It is incredible. And then not only are workers and consumers against this measure aswell as environmentalists, businesspeople are against it as well.  I feel like there is some missing part to this thing. TheAmerican Sustainable Business Council has over 200,000 businesses. So here is labor and commerce combined, urging Congress notto do this on the second day of a new Congress with all the challenges that are before us, and he says it wouldn't create anyproblems. It would be okay to put in 1 or 2 or 3 or 5 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60. This is incredible. It is not that we areworking so hard that we don't have time to examine each one on a particular basis.                              {time}  1415  Can you imagine this Congress trying to block regulations which would be offered in one bill that couldbe over 60 different regulations? I mean, it is unthinkable. It is not very practical at all.  When we talk about meatlabeling regulations and then in another paragraph or another section there would be standards for school lunch nutrition, theywould be combined. My friend from California would say, well, that is no problem. We will take them separately, but they willall come in the same package.  So if you wanted to examine all of these things individually, we could have an instance wherethe whole Congress could be consumed for weeks or for months trying to figure out why they should block all of these importantand sensible safeguards.  Business and labor are joined with us, and, to me, it is beyond comprehension for us to beconcerned about not taking them up one at a time. This is worse than a conservative point of view, which I haven't found myselfoften agreeing with. But just to say let's have unlimited numbers of these blocking provisions all into one is beyond mycomprehension.

13362,topic-id,643,"Mr.Speaker, how much time remains on each side?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman fromMichigan has 6 minutes remaining. The gentleman from California has 13\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My colleague from Tennessee has been a good friend on manyissues. I know he is passionate about regulations and laws that he would like to have passed, and so am  All of us inCongress have seen that it is extremely easy--the longer you are here, the more you will see it--it is extremely easy to stopsomething here. The same is true about those 61 or so regulations. Any combining of regulations, unless they are overwhelminglydisapproved, actually makes them harder to pass. We are not going to put 61 pieces of legislation, each of which has at leastone or two or three or a dozen Republicans who vehemently oppose that regulation being rescinded. The fact is it is only theworst of the worst that are going to be stayed through this process and then reevaluated by the new administration.  I willmention, though, for my colleagues on the other side of this debate today, that we do appropriations every year. The Americanpeople, and for the freshmen who haven't voted on appropriations yet, think of appropriations as somehow different than the law.It really isn't. Appropriation is simply a law that provides funding.  Every appropriation bill during the entire nearly 8 years of President Obama has been some form of a continuing resolution or an omnibus. But as my colleaguefrom Tennessee knows, every one of those has had dozens to hundreds of laws attached to them. We call them riders. We have termsfor them. The fact is that a single appropriations bill, often done just before the end of funding of the government,always--always--has dozens, if not hundreds, of laws attached to it.  So the idea that we don't group together things which arerelatively noncontroversial, that will cause someone to still vote for the bill in spite of it being in there, would be to bedishonest to the freshmen who need to know that we do for efficiency bring together things that we can pass en bloc, and we doit all the time--and even major legislation. I dare say, the Affordable Care Act and others are, in fact, multiple pieces oflegislation put together in one package.  So lest our freshmen who are about to take their first vote on a piece oflegislation--or one that could have a major impact--misunderstand, bringing together multiple pieces into one bill is common, butit is always done in order to gain votes or to maintain votes. In fact, you do it at your folly if you lose votes.  I wouldsay to my friend and colleague from Michigan that there is no likelihood that 61 pieces of regulation will be put togetherbecause there is no chance that there would be 61 pieces that even all Republicans would agree should be revoked. I wouldimagine the number would be less. I suspect that if my bill said 2 or 5 or 10, it would still be opposed for the same reason,which is that it creates inefficiency if there are multiple generally agreed bad pieces of legislation that need to beconsidered.  Lastly, and I am not closing, but I think this may be one of my closing remarks, for freshmen to understand,this isn't even about the We have the procedures in the House where we could put these together. This is about the Senatethat can take 60 hours, 60 legislative hours or more, to do one piece of legislation. We know that the Senate has confirmationsto do of judges and appointees for the Cabinet, and they have other legislative work, and we cannot afford to have them backedup now or in the future if there are multiple regulations that need to be rescinded.

CongressionalResearch Service,                                                  January 3, 2017.                               Memorandum     Subject: ``Major'' ObamaAdministration Rules Potentially          Eligible to be Overturned under the Congressional Review          Act in the 115th     From:Maeve Carey, Specialist in Government Organization          and Management; Christopher Davis, Analyst on Congress          and theLegislative Process; Casey Burgat, Research                This memorandum lists ``major'' rules issued byfederal      agencies under the Barack Obama Administration that are      potentially subject to consideration under the procedures of      theCongressional Review Act (CRA) in the 115th This      is an updated version of a general distribution memorandum      releasedby CRS on November 17, 2016, and previously updated      on December 6, 2016.               Background on theCongressional Review Act       The CRA is a tool that Congress may use to overturn a rule      issued by a federalagency, including, in some cases, rules      issued in a previous session of Congress and by a previous      The CRA requiresagencies to report on their      rulemaking activities to Congress and provides Congress with      a special set of procedures under whichto consider      legislation to overturn those rules. The CRA, which was      enacted in 1996, was largely intended to assert control      overagency rulemaking by establishing a special set of      expedited or ``fast track'' legislative procedures for this      purpose,primarily in the       Of the approximately 73,000 final rules that have been      submitted to Congress since the legislationwas enacted in      1996, the CRA has been used to disapprove one rule: the      Occupational Safety and Health Administration's November2000      final rule on ergonomics, which was overturned using the CRA      in March 2001. The primary reason the CRA has overturned      onerule in the 20 years since its enactment is that under      most circumstances, it is likely that a President would veto      such aresolution in order to protect rules developed under      his own administration, and it may also be difficult for      Congress to musterthe two-thirds vote in both houses needed      to overturn the veto. However, under a specific set of      circumstances--a turnover inparty control of the White House,      particularly a turnover in which the incoming President      shares a party affiliation with amajority in both houses of      Congress--the CRA is more likely to be used successfully. The      March 2001 rejection of the ergonomicsrule was the result of      that set of circumstances. Similar circumstances will take      place in 2017 after the start of the 115thCongress and after      President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.                         CRA ``Reset''Mechanism       Section 801(d) of the CRA provides that, if Congress      adjourns its annual session sine die lessthan 60 legislative      days in the House of Representatives or 60 session days in      the Senate after a rule is submitted to it, thenthe periods      to submit and act on a disapproval resolution ``reset'' in      their entirety in the next session of Congress'' Thepurpose      of this provision is to ensure that both houses of Congress      have sufficient time to consider disapproving rulessubmitted      during this end-of-session ``carryover period.'' This      provision applies in every session of Congress, but it is      ofparticular relevance in sessions of Congress that coincide      with presidential transitions. This provision allows, for a      limitedtime period, a new Congress to consider a joint      resolution disapproving a rule issued late in the previous      administration. Ifintroduced and considered at the proper      time, such a joint resolution cannot be filibustered in the            The projectedsecond-session meeting schedules of the House      and Senate issued by each chamber's majority leader may be      used to estimate thedate in 2016 after which final rules      submitted to Congress will be subject to the renewed review      periods in 2017 describedabove. The estimated start of the      reset period for all rules was determined by counting back      from the projected sine dieadjournment in the respective      chambers--60 days of session in the Senate and 60 legislative      days in the House--then taking theearlier of the two dates.       Under this calculation, CRS estimates that agency final      rules submitted to Congress on or afterJune 13, 2016, will be      subject to renewed review periods in 2017 by a new President      and a new CRS day count estimatesare unofficial and      non-binding; the House and Senate Parliamentarians are the      sole definitive arbiters of the operation of theCRA mechanism      and should be consulted if a formal opinion is desired.     ``Major'' ObamaAdministration Rules Potentially Eligible for                   Consideration under the CRA in 2017       Using this estimatedreset date of June 13, 2016, CRS      compiled a list of major rules that would fall under this      reset period--i.e., rules that couldbe overturned in the      115th Congress using the       Table 1 lists the major rules CRS has identified as of      January 3, 2017,that could be eligible for the reset      mechanism. To identify these rules, CRS used a two-step      process. First, CRS consulted theGovernment Accountability      Office's (GAO's) federal rules database to identify major      rules that were issued during calendar year2016 and posted on      GAO's website as of January 3, 2017. Second, CRS used LIS's      ``Executive Communications'' database to identifywhen these      rules were received in  MajorRules Issued by the Obama Administration That Are Potentially Eligible for Disapproval Under the Congressional Review Act in the115th                                 Congress       major rules listed on gao's website as of january 3, 2017       Title of Rule (As Published in Federal Register) and RIN      Numbers are as follows:       Exemptions To Facilitate Intrastateand Regional Securities      Offerings, 3235-AL80;

13260,topic-id,1339,"Mr President, I am proud to introduce the Fairness in Federal Disaster Declarations Act today, together with my colleague Senator Duckworth, to try to bring some transparency and fairness into FEMA's disaster declaration process.  The inspiration for this bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012, a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, causing major damage in the towns of Harrisburg and Eight people in Harrisburg died in that event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds reached 175 miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say these two small towns were almost wiped off the map.  And just last week, on February 28, 2017, another tragedy struck the small towns of Ottawa and Naplate after a category F-3 tornado tore through North Central Two people in Ottawa died in last week's storm and at least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed.  Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the Governor of each State based on State emergency management damage assessments. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the Governor's request for a Federal emergency declaration for individual assistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With that denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were precluded from direct Federal help.  When I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request, I was told that the disaster did not meet or exceed the State's per capita figure. Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a State by $1.43 to determine a threshold of the amount of damage a State would incur to be considered for Federal assistance. In Illinois, that figure is more than $18 million. In other words, because Illinois is a highly populous State, it is presumed it can absorb the costs of cleanup and recovery from disasters up to more than $18 million.  From 2002 to 2012, Illinois was denied Federal disaster assistance seven times. Texas was denied 13 times. Florida was denied Federal disaster assistance eight times during that period, and California, New Jersey, and New York were each denied four times.  FEMA's formula does not work for large, populous States, particularly those with a concentrated urban area, like  Illinois ran into this issue again in November 2013 when tornadoes swept through the That time, six people were killed and whole neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The cities of Washington, Gifford, and New Minden, Illinois, experienced some of the worst tornado damage I have ever seen. Their infrastructure was decimated, but because Illinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal public assistance.  In the case of last week's tornado in Ottawa and Naplate, Illinois, may not even be able to request federal help because damage assessments are too low to reach anything close to FEMA's per capita requirement. But for these small towns, covering losses and cleaning up damage of this magnitude can put a real strain on the community.  The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the disaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must consider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be made available. When it comes to individual assistance--funding to help people repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as follows:  Concentration of damages--the density of damage in an individual community--would be considered 20 percent of the analysis. Trauma--the loss of life and injuries and the disruption of normal community functions--would be 20 percent. Special Populations--including the age and income of the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would comprise 20 percent. Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of what the volunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5 percent. The amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent. And average amount of individual assistance by State, which includes the per capita analysis, would make up 5 percent of the analysis.  The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics--the economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration. This includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median income as it compares to that of the State, and the poverty rate as it compares to that of the  For Federal public assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a greater emphasis placed on the localized impacts of the disaster, which would warrant 40 percent of the analysis.  It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of the State requesting assistance, but current regulations penalize large Assigning values to the factors will help ensure that the damage to a specific community weighs more than a State's population.  Illinois is a geographically large State with a concentrated urban area. And downstate communities are being punished for it.  If the cities of Ottawa and Naplate, Washington and Gifford, and Harrisburg and Ridgway cannot qualify under FEMA's current criteria for Federal assistance, something is wrong. The way FEMA evaluates whether to declare an area Federal disaster is not effective. It is working against small communities in States with large populations.

13261,topic-id,1833,"Mr.President, today, Senator Wicker of Mississippi and I are reintroducing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program This bill, named for a mentor of mine--the late Senator from Illinois, embodies a vision Paul Simon believed in throughout his life: a vision centered on our country's need for a culturally aware, and globally knowledgeable population and workforce.  Senator Simon saw these characteristics as essential to our country's economy, society, and national security. He believed that by building meaningful relationships with people around the world, America would grow even stronger as a nation. In his words, ``America's incompetence in foreign languages and cultural awareness jeopardizes our Nation's future in global affairs. This lack of global perspective damages America's ability to compete in world markets. The more our country becomes competent in foreign languages and cultures, the more enhanced our foreign policy decisions will become.''  He also believed that to truly be educated, our students needed more than a minimal understanding of the world around them. To be truly educated, they need to immerse themselves in the beliefs, customs, language, and environment of a culture other than their own. I share these beliefs with Senator Simon and many Republicans in this Chamber share them as well.  At a time when there are calls from some to shut out immigrants and refugees and pull away from other parts of the world, these beliefs are more important than ever. We need to continue to give our young people the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world, so they can develop their own informed opinions and beliefs.  Undergraduate study abroad programs are a popular source for this type of engagement. Unfortunately, far too few students take advantage or have the means to take advantage of this opportunity. Annually, less than 2 percent of undergraduate students participate in study abroad.  Those who do study abroad don't reflect the incredible diversity of our postsecondary institutions. Minority students, first-generation college students, community college students, and students with disabilities are significantly underrepresented in the study abroad population. These students miss out on the valuable personal and educational growth that comes from a study abroad experience, including interacting with other cultures, developing foreign language skills, and expanding international knowledge through firsthand experience.  We also know that those who currently study abroad do so mostly in highly developed countries. In fact, over 50 percent of students who study abroad each year do so in Increasing the diversity of study abroad destinations to include countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Latin America will help American students develop a global perspective and build the insight and skills needed to better understand the global challenges of the 21st century.  In 2004, Congress took the first step towards expanding study abroad when it authorized the Commission on Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program to provide recommendations to Congress and the President on expanding study abroad programs.  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act combines the vision of Senator Simon with the recommendations of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad It establishes a competitive grant program for institutions of higher education to encourage the sustainable expansion of study abroad opportunities for students in the United  Over the next 10 years, this grant program aims to increase the number of undergraduate students stud g abroad each year to one million students. It also emphasizes increasing opportunities for nontraditional students, minority students, and students with disabilities so that the demographics of students who study abroad more closely reflect the population of current undergraduate students.  This bill also focuses on getting students to study abroad in nontraditional destinations particularly in developing countries. We need to send more students to developing nations because these are the places that America needs to better understand. This legislation takes important steps toward expanding and diversifying participation in study abroad.  Senator Wicker and I are pleased to be joined today in introducing this bill by Senators Reed, Cochran, Merkley, and I am also pleased that several organizations have endorsed this bill including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association of International Educators, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and  In today's increasingly interconnected world, study abroad participation is an important element of a meaningful undergraduate education. Expanded access to study abroad opportunities is necessary to prepare the next generation of Americans with the global knowledge and skills needed to succeed. I hope other colleagues will join us in that effort.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 601       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study      Abroad Program Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global      economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as      part of a well-rounded education.       (2) Study abroad programs provide students with      unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched      opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique      environment for developing cultural understanding, all of      which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global      economy.       (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary      students in the United States study abroad for credit in any      given year, and minority students, first generation college      students, community college students, and students with      disabilities are significantly underrepresented in study      abroad participation.       (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission      on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program      pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations      and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).      Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to      Congress and the President a report of its recommendations      for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at      institutions of higher education in the United States to      study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing      nations.       (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience      shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will      drive the number of study abroad participants higher and      improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only      way that study abroad will become an integral part of the      undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is      necessary to encourage and support such leadership.     3.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access      to quality study abroad opportunities;       (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying      abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of      higher education in the United States;       (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad      destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that      takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,      especially in developing countries; and       (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of      higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.     4.

13215,topic-id,721,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank the chairman for yielding, but, more importantly, for his extraordinarily hard work as chairman of the Rules I don't think a lot of people are aware just how critical his job is in shepherding and guiding order in our institution here. So I am grateful for his hard work, most grateful for his friendship, and very grateful for his leadership. I thank him so much for the time.  Mr.Speaker, when Presidents give their inaugural addresses, we are very accustomed to lofty narratives, to visionary ideals, and to sweeping language. But last Friday, President Trump spoke very differently. The only sweeping thing in the President's speech was his reference to the windswept plains of Of course, when I heard that, I perked up.  President Trump's speech was a striking and direct call for a new, healthy nationalism. He spoke to the people, about the people, and for the people. A certain awkwardness marked the beginning of his speech, not only because of the initial confrontational style from the outset, but it also began to rain as the President started, creating a bit of an uncomfortable moment. But then the rain suddenly stopped and his speech gained momentum. He discussed, in hard terms, some of the stark realities we are facing and how they might be resolved for our country.  Mr.Speaker, we all know this, that defining problems is an easy task, but finding solutions is much harder. While President Trump's speech lacked specifics in that regard, nonetheless, there was extraordinary power in the attempt to articulate an America that has been lost to globalized supply-side elitism, an America that has been lost to drugs and crime, and an America that has systems that no longer seem to serve all persons. It just seems that no matter how hard individuals work, they just can't get ahead.  Mr.Speaker, our President's speech was an authoritative call for a new national unity, particularly for those forgotten. The idea that America can do better, that we must do better, and that we will do better for everyone was clearly conveyed by President  I recognize the tone of this speech will not have universal appeal. It was to the point, direct, and firm. It was not a delicate, textured speech. But the President was clear when he declared: ``The American carnage stops right here and stops right now.''  Mr.Speaker, we are witnessing a renewed and important and essential focus on reviving America's economy. The multinational corporations of this world are on notice: they cannot play both sides of the balance sheet, being for us and against us at the same time, and the benefits of exchange will have to be fair for all. Frankly, I believe this creates possibilities, possibilities for authentic relationships with peoples around the world rather than a transactional one. If this objective can be achieved, it will be constructive indeed. A healthy American nationalism will lead to properly ordered international engagement--for our benefit and the benefit of others.  Mr.Speaker, when the President spoke before the entirety of our government, he also spoke before the House of The President's authoritative style, communicating the desire to devolve power from Washington as well as Wall Street, interestingly repositions Congress to its appropriate role in governing society through the power of the people.  Mr.Speaker, it is statistically shown that the majority of Americans believe that it is the job of Congress to do whatever the President says. This is not true. Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government that makes the law, which is interpreted by the judiciary and enforced by the But across Democratic and across Republican executive administrations more and more power has been taken by the executive and has been ceded by This balance of power, this necessary balance of power, this original idea of the balance of power, has been out of balance for 100 years, and perhaps now a realignment begins.[[Page H595]]  Mr.Speaker, whether you love President Trump or you loathe him, or whether you are someplace in between with certain apprehensions but hoping that President Trump succeeds, Friday, Inauguration Day, was an extraordinary American day.

13452,topic-id,994,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about a path forward on healthcare.  Last week, Republicans in the House failed to pass the American Health Care Act--a deeply flawed policy that amounted to little more than a massive tax break for the wealthy at the expense of working people. The failure of that bill means that, as Speaker Ryan put it, the ACA is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. So today I would like to invite my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to leave repeal efforts behind and instead roll up their sleeves and work with me and other Democrats to improve the system we already have, which is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. It is time to pass commonsense reforms that build on the successes of the ACA and lower healthcare costs.  In a recent HELP Committee hearing, Chairman Alexander said that he wanted to work on a bipartisan basis to stabilize the individual market. Let's do that. We should reinstate and strengthen programs that help insurance companies stay in the marketplace and continue to serve even the sickest patients. We should pass a public option to make sure there is competition in every market. We should provide more tax credits to more people.  While we work on those things, there is something else we should do, something that, together with a group of my colleagues, I introduced a bill about yesterday. It is time to bring down healthcare costs for everyone by reducing the price of prescription drugs. It is time to pass the Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs  I think all of us would agree that no one should have to choose between affording a lifesaving drug and putting food on the table for one's family, but right now that is happening. Companies are setting prices that are beyond the reach of consumers and that are driving up costs for insurers and taxpayers.  One in five Americans says he has not filled a prescription simply because he could not afford it. Others are rationing care due to high prices. A study published just last month found that about 10 percent of cancer patients skipped their medication and about 13 percent delayed filling their prescriptions. We have all been shocked by the stories of EpiPen's prices shooting up nearly 500 percent. The price of insulin has more than doubled in the last 5 years.  Drug companies can essentially set whatever prices they want. As a result, in recent years, drug companies have secured some of the highest profit margins of any industry.  Drug prices are too high. That is why my colleagues and I are introducing comprehensive legislation to tackle prescription drug prices. We want to make sure companies cannot exploit the sick and dying to make a profit. The bill includes 17 policy changes that will improve transparency, promote affordability, spur innovation, and enhance competition. Today, I would like to highlight just three of those provisions.  First, transparency. This legislation requires drug companies to disclose how much they spend on research, manufacturing, and marketing, as well as research grants from the Federal Government, to help all of us understand why prices for lifesaving drugs are so high. It is especially galling that so many drugs that are developed with taxpayer dollars are unaffordable for so many Getting this information would help all of us hold drug companies accountable, and that can be an important step toward bringing prices down.  Second--something that President Trump called for on the campaign trail--the bill will allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. It is just common sense that the biggest buyer of pharmaceutical products in America should be able to use its negotiating clout to bring prices down.  Third, the bill would end the practice of so-called pay-for-delay. Right now, drug companies that make the expensive brand-name drugs will pay other companies that make generic alternatives to keep their products off the market. This is called pay-for-delay. It is outrageous, and it is increasingly common. This bill will stop these agreements once and for all.  There is a lot more that this bill does. It penalizes companies that price-gouge for lifesaving medicine, and I think we can all agree on that. It puts a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs in insurance plans. It speeds up generic competition. It funds new innovation and includes a number of other provisions.  Tackling the high cost of prescription drugs is an issue many of my colleagues care deeply about. This bill reflects many of their ideas and proposals, and I am grateful for their work with me. Moreover, it is obvious that the public is ready for action on this issue. Overwhelming majorities of Americans in both parties support government action to curb out-of-control drug prices.  I am eager to hear from colleagues on both sides of the aisle and from the administration about how we can work together to pass the reforms into law. This is an area of health policy that Democrats are eager to work on, and we hope the President will stand by his promise to stand up to drug companies and reduce costs for American families. It is morally wrong that some people are denied access to lifesaving drugs because they cannot afford them, and it is something we can fix.  I am in the Senate so that I can fight for policies that improve people's lives. That is why I am here. With this bill, I am trying to do exactly that. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in helping to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2146.txt,1969,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

13319,topic-id,140,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise as a proud marine on behalf of countless veterans across America whose healthcare options will vanish if House Republicans succeed in repealing the Affordable Care The ACA has provided an invaluable safety net for our Nation's veterans, fulfilling critical gaps in coverage within the VA system.  Mr.Speaker, in the first 2 years after the ACA's implementation, the rate of uninsured veterans dropped by an astonishing 43 percent. This was largely due to the fact that, through the ACA's Medicaid expansion, 7 out of 10 previously uninsured veterans became eligible for coverage.  The Republicans' so-called repeal-and-replace plan would slash veterans' options by abandoning our commitment to a more inclusive Medicaid program. Democrats refuse to compromise on care for our Nation's heroes, and we absolutely refuse to compromise in the fight to preserve the lifesaving Affordable Care                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2025.txt,2226,CONGRATULATING THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY,2017.0,10.0,January
13298,topic-id,1731,"Mr.President, as I stated repeatedly before the Presidential election of this past year, we stood, and continue to stand, at a very pivotal time in our Nation's history.  After 8 years of using the judicial and regulatory systems to push through its legislative agenda, the balance of power had shifted from what our Founders intended. Our Founders intended the Congress to make the laws and write the laws, the executive branch to implement the laws, and the judiciary to be guardians of the Constitution, not to make the laws.  That is why we said that the next President of the United States, whether they be Democrat or Republican, would have the opportunity to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, following the Biden rule--the edict that there wouldn't be a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee until after that year's Presidential election--to allow the American people to make their decision, giving the American people a say in the direction of this country for years to come. In return, they have given us this nominee.  It is with great pride that I rise today to talk about the nominee today--a fellow Coloradan, Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Judge Gorsuch comes to the Court with that unique western perspective that the Presiding Officer and I share. Our States of Utah and Colorado obviously like to see that western perspective shared at the Tenth Circuit Court, where it is housed in the West, but at every level of our courts and to the Supreme Court--adding to Justice Kennedy's background and to others who share that same perspective and history in the Supreme  Born in Denver, Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan, coming from a long line of individuals who have dedicated their life to service not only to the State of Colorado but to the His mother, Ann Gorsuch, served in the Colorado House of Representatives and, during the Reagan administration, she was the first female Administrator of the Environmental Protection His grandfather, John Gorsuch, founded one of Denver's largest law firms, Gorsuch Kirgis, where both he and Neil's father, Dave, practiced throughout the firm's successful 60-year-old history. His stepfather, Robert Buford, was a former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives who went on to become the head of the Bureau of Land  Judge Gorsuch is also one of our country's brightest legal minds, with a sterling reputation, and significant experience as a Federal judge and a private litigator. He has impeccable academic credentials and is a widely respected legal scholar. He received his bachelor's degree from Columbia University, graduated from Harvard Law School, and was a Marshall scholar at Oxford University, where he obtained a doctorate in legal philosophy.  Of course, I cannot forget the summer he spent at the University of Colorado as well. Judge Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices--Byron White, a Colorado native as well. In fact, in his comments last night after the announcement of his nomination, Judge Gorsuch mentioned that he worked for the only Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court and also the only leading rusher in the NFL to ever serve on the Supreme  He also clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, as well as for Judge David Sentelle on the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Following his clerkships, Judge Gorsuch went into private[[Page S558]]practice, eventually rising to the rank of partner in the elite litigation law firm of Kellogg Huber, leaving practice in 2005 to serve as a high-ranking official in the Bush administration Justice A year later, President George Bush nominated Gorsuch to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a position for which he was confirmed by a unanimous vote. I think it is very telling that not only was he confirmed by a unanimous vote, but roughly 11 or 12 members of the Democratic conference were there to vote for Judge There are people serving today who voted for Judge I believe SCOTUSblog recently reported that when Judge Gorsuch was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court, then, Neil Gorsuch's confirmation hearing was sparsely attended. I believe it mentioned that only a few people attended. I think Senator Lindsey Graham, our colleague from South Carolina, was one of the Senators to attend his confirmation hearing. I believe Senator Leahy, our colleague from Vermont, submitted questions for the record. But as SCOTUSblog cited, very few people attended his confirmation hearing because of the high caliber and high quality of the nomination. He was introduced by my predecessor from Colorado, Ken Salazar, and was praised from Senator Salazar's perspective for being impartial, fair, and the having the kind of temperament that we need in the circuit court.  Judge Gorsuch is an ardent faithful defender of the Constitution and has the appropriate temperament, as then-Senator Salazar noted, to serve on the Nation's highest Of course, he was then talking about the Tenth Circuit Judge Gorsuch recognizes that the judiciary isn't the place for social or constitutional experimentation, and efforts to engage in such experimentation delegitimizes the He has said:       This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to      debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the      judiciary. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the      give-and-take of the political process and the flexibility of      social experimentation that only the elected branches can      provide.  Here we see his understanding that certain debates are to take place where debate is held by those elected directly by the people--in the  Judge Gorsuch believes in the separation of powers as established by our Founding Fathers in the As he rightly stated, ``a firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-functioning democracy,'' understanding the value of three branches of government, the value of an independent judiciary, understanding that there are certain things dedicated exclusively to the judiciary, to the legislative branch, and to the executive.  Judge Gorsuch is not an ideologue. He is a mainstream jurist who follows the law as written and doesn't try to supplant it with his personal policy preferences. He said: ``Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and conclusions always do.''  Judge Gorsuch understands the advantage of democratic institutions and the special authority and legitimacy that come from the consent of the government. He said: ``Judges must allow the elected branches of government to flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the day.''  Judge Gorsuch appreciates the rule of law and respects the considered judgment of those who came before him. He said:       Precedent is to be respected and honored. It is not      something to be diminished or demeaned.  This morning, I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Gorsuch--of course, knowing him from Colorado and the town of Boulder, where he lives today, and also where I received my law degree. We spent a lot of time talking about our favorite passions in Colorado, whether it is fly-fishing, whether it is paddle-boarding. Of course, he spends a lot of time out on the Boulder Reservoir, enjoying recreation--just like every other person in Boulder does and every other person in Colorado does--as somebody who understands the great outdoors. We talked about the rule of law. We talked about the separation of powers, his concern over originalism and textualism, and following in the footsteps of other great Justices on the Supreme  We talked about something he said last night when his name was put forward for nomination by President We talked about a statement he made to this effect: If a judge likes every opinion that they have written, every decision that they have reached, they are probably a bad judge. I think this goes to his insistence that, as a judge, you must put your personal beliefs, your personal policies aside to rule as the rule of law requires and to rule as the Constitution and the statutes require.  We discussed in our meeting decisions he made of which he didn't like the outcome but believed that the rule of law required a certain outcome--whether it was a felon who possessed a handgun or whether the Federal Government had misspoken to the accused and he believed that the government had done the accused wrong.  While Judge Gorsuch personally believed that perhaps he would have liked to have found a guilty decision or agreed with a guilty decision, he couldn't do it because of the standards that were applied in the case--the grammatical gravity that had to be ignored in order to reach the conclusion the lower court had reached.  His ability to put personal opinions aside, I think, is what makes him an ideal candidate for the U.Supreme Over the coming days and months, we are going to have many opportunities to talk about the qualities of Judge Gorsuch, but we have already heard many people complain that perhaps they didn't pay enough attention to Judge Gorsuch 10 years ago. They talked about their concern, this newfound concern that was not available--that apparently wasn't there 10 years ago when this Senate unanimously supported Judge  I have even heard complaints that they didn't like the way that his nomination was announced--a complaint about how the President announced the nomination. Those are the kinds of concerns we are hearing about Judge Gorsuch today because they didn't like the way he was announced.  We are going to have a lot of opportunity to talk about his temperament, those things he believes are important as a judge, those things he believes are important to make decisions. I look forward to having a conversation about what I believe is a brilliant legal mind--someone of a brilliant legal mind, someone with a sterling reputation, someone who has been known as a feeder judge of clerks to the highest Court in the land, someone who rules on the law and not on his personal beliefs, someone who believes in the Constitution and not in the role of legislator from the bench.  I am grateful I had this opportunity to support a Coloradan, a man of the West, to Nation's highest Court, and I look forward to working to place Judge Gorsuch as Associate Justice to the U.Supreme  Mr.President, I yield back my time.

13381,topic-id,1820,"Mr.Speaker, I was handed a letter by a lady when I was at one of the many events that I attended in my district. It is how I stay in touch with what is going on. This lady says: ``U.Congressman Louie Gohmert: I am a 52-year-old widow. ObamaCare is a major financial problem for me. Someone needs to fix the healthcare system. One-third of the money I get from my deceased husband's retirement fund is given to health care. My deductible alone is $7,000.''  She has an exclamation point.  ``I am angry with the government deciding how I should spend what little money I have. I had to get a part-time job just to put gas in my car. So I clean tables and I mop floors. I am physically unable to work full time. I am frustrated with the fact I had to move back in with my parents just to make ends meet. Would you like that? Could or would you do something to relieve this burden?''  That is from a 52-year-old widow in my district. That is what we have done with the burden, We here in Congress decided: You know what? We are going to tell people like this widow how she has to spend what little money she has left. We are going to force this woman to go clean tables and mop floors when she is physically unable to work full time because we here in Washington have decided we know better than she does. So we have every right in Congress to force people like this dear widow to get on her hands and knees to work for the United States Pay your taxes and now, that is not enough. We are going to tell you that you are being forced to spend your money on health care that will never help you a dime because you have a $7,000 deductible.  Or how about hearing, 2 weeks ago, from a friend, one of those who was cut because of financial troubles. They had 100 employees. They can't afford the ObamaCare, so they have cut their 100 to 70, and they are continuing to work to get down to 49. Why? Because of So we have already had 30 breadwinners, men and women, lose their jobs because of one thing:  And now there are going to be 21 more who lose their jobs because of one thing: They have got to get it under 50 so they don't have to keep paying such ridiculous prices for health insurance that has such high deductibles nobody will ever benefit.  Who is benefiting? Well, it can't be all of the health insurance companies because they have dropped out. They can't make money. So it has to be the government that is making all the money from this ObamaCare program.  A single mom told me she had been working at McDonald's making ends meet, but because of ObamaCare, they cut her hours back. Now she has to work at both McDonald's and Burger King, and she was in tears because it is just too much.  And why is she having to do it? Because people right here in this House and the other body, without one Republican vote in this body, told America: Too bad. You are not working enough at McDonald's. We want to make your life miserable. We are going to make you work at two places part time just like this widow that we condemned to start scrubbing tables and floors because the Democrats in this body, without a single Republican vote, decided we know better what you need to do with your time and your money than you do.  So it is a problem of arrogance when Washington thinks it knows so much better than people across the country. And yes, I know, I represent the 26 percent that didn't vote for me. I understand that. And I have heard from them, and I don't need a townhall to know they are for keeping this albatross of a healthcare system. The ACA is not affordable, though. It is ridiculous to call it affordable care.  One of the problems is, when you have to take precious healthcare dollars that used to go to providing care in a hospital, in a clinic, for a patient, now it goes to government navigators. Why? Because there were union officials that decided: We have lost too many union members. The unions that are growing are the government unions, the very ones that Franklin Roosevelt said you should never have a union composed of government workers.  Think about it. You are working for the people of the United States of Why would you need a union to organize against the people? Sounds un-But those are the ones that are growing. And union leaders, without concern for their members, decided: Let's embrace as many aliens as we can get into the country, legally or otherwise, because they will join the union and that will grow our ranks; and we as union leaders will be better off, but our members' wages will continue to go down, our members will continue to lose jobs. But, gee, we may have more people in our union.  We know that there was supposed to be thousands of new IRS agents hired so that they could help enforce It is a travesty. The bill that has been filed is not going to do it, but, hopefully, our Republican leadership will be willing to work things out and not prevent good amendments that will make it palatable so enough of us can vote for it.  I have gotten to know President Trump a bit, and I feel like he wants the best deal he can get for If this bill were the best he could get, he would probably have to live with that, but we can do a whole lot better. Some of us are determined we are not going to vote for one that doesn't.  In the meantime, there is so much talk by President Obama and all of his minions that are still out there trying to undermine the Trump administration. We have a crisis here in Congress[[Page H1590]]that people are not talking about. I keep bringing it up. Doesn't seem to be a lot of folks who want to talk about it.  There was a time when we had mainstream media that actually did research, asked questions, dug to the bottom of things. But there are IT--information technology, mainly working with computers--employees, shared employees for several Democrats that are under investigation. Imran Awan was the company owner. Abid Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi--the wife of Imran Awan--and Natalia Sova, wife of Abid Awan, each made $160,000 a year as IT-shared employees working on computers for various Democrats in the House of  The Awan brothers are of Pakistani descent, but their immigration status is unclear. There are a lot of things that are unknown about the Awan brothers. But they worked for our former DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz--that is Imran These people are under investigation for stealing material, potentially accessing material they shouldn't have, for taking material off of Capitol Hill and stealing it, using it in other places.  We are told, oh, not to worry, they didn't access classified intelligence information in the SCIF; but other IT people tell me, once someone is in the congressional system, the calendar, email for one Member of Congress, if they are good, it is not that hard to break into lots of other Members of Congress' email and calendars.  What country that hates America--some that like America--wouldn't love to know who people are meeting, especially on the Intelligence Committee like some of the people that have employed these?  Some of them, very fine members of things like the Ethics Committee, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence Let's see, Andre Carson, Sandy Levin, Jackie Speier--a lot of people, good people--Tim A lot of these folks, they employed these folks. They were very trusting, kind people. And these people didn't have a background check, and now they are under investigation. I heard some have been told that Imran Awan, the lead guy, went back to  Well, if this guy set up and was working on computer systems, is it possible he could have--and this is what a normal mainstream reporter, 30, 40 years ago back in the seventies would have asked: Well, did he set up the DNC computer system that got hacked, that was supposedly hacked by Russians or others, did he set that up so it could be hacked? I mean, there is a lot here going on that we don't know the answers to, and we deserve to know the answers.  There were mortgage transfers, debt evading bankruptcies. Imran Awan, Jamal Awan were known to be the ringleaders of the group, had been providing services since 2005; has convictions for driving offenses which were serious enough to become criminal misdemeanors, used an illegal radar detector, drove an unregistered vehicle; some say, after masterminding the family's finances, was running the business completely by 2010 and instructed Abid not to even speak to anyone.  The wives of Imran and Abid also began receiving paychecks from the House of They purchased two homes in Lorton in 2008, one of which was associated with all three brothers at one time. Alvi sold that home in 2016 to the younger brother Jamal for $620,000.  Imran owned a home and put it in his father's name in 2008 in Abid later claimed, in bankruptcy, that the house was his.  Jamal Awan was placed on the House payroll at age 20, making $160,000.  Imran is also a real estate agent. Despite making $160,000 in congressional salaries, debts went unpaid by the Awan brothers, including debts to the Congressional Federal Credit  $100,000 was taken from a known Hezbollah-connected fugitive, a fugitive from the FBI; and they are associated with this Hezbollah-connected agent, and there is no press out there getting to the bottom of it? What happened to the Washington press, the proud press of Washington of the 1970s? Well, they are in the bag for one party. They are not interested in getting to the bottom of the news. They are all about advocating.  God not just bless America, God help We have got to have people wake up before we do much more damage to ourselves. It is time to turn this country around, and one of the things we should start with is getting to the bottom of this investigation; find out how much damage these alleged criminals did from Pakistan to our Congress, and also start undoing the damage ObamaCare has done so people can get jobs again they have lost, so people can have health care that has deductibles they can afford. It is time to make America great again.

13347,topic-id,876,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker,Federal bureaucrats are continuously creating new and more complicated and costly burdens on hardworking Americans in the formof unnecessarily burdensome regulations. Clearly, some regulation is necessary to protect public safety, set general rules ofthe road, and accomplish other important goals.  However, despite the fact that these goals can often be accomplished withrelatively simple guidance, Washington bureaucrats seem more determined than ever to create the most complicated puzzles theycan imagine, regardless of the compliance costs for small businesses or the new and innovative products entrepreneurs are forcedto shelve in order to comply with these overly complicated regulations.  Bureaucrats also don't seem to care that Americanfamilies face higher prices for goods and have fewer job opportunities when employers are unnecessarily forced to factorwasteful costs of complying with overly burdensome regulations into their bottom lines.  That is why, at the very beginningof the 115th Congress, we are prioritizing legislation to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens. Doing so is one of thefundamental steps we can take to make America more competitive again[[Page H75]]and put more Americans back to work again.  Today,our specific focus is on reforming regulations that are hastily cobbled together in the waning weeks and months of an outgoingadministration. These regulations are particularly susceptible to abuse and, thus, have an even greater potential to underminejob opportunities, wages, and American competitiveness.  As the Obama administration rushes to a close, Americans' freedomand prosperity are increasingly threatened by one of the most abusive features of modern bureaucracy--midnight regulation.  Midnight regulation is one of the most vexing problems in Washington's overreaching regulatory system. Administration afteradministration, there is a spike in rulemaking activity during the last year of a President's term--particularly between electionday and Inauguration Day, but even in the months before then.  These successive waves of midnight regulation present deeplytroubling issues. First and foremost, because outgoing administrations are no longer accountable to the voters, they are muchmore prone to issue midnight regulations that fly in the face of the electoral mandate the voters just gave the new, incomingadministration.  Waves of midnight rules can also be very hard for Congress or a new administration to check adequately. As anew Congress and President begin their terms, both understandably must be focused on implementing the new priorities within themandates the voters have given them. That doesn't always leave time to focus on cleaning up all of the last acts of thedeparting administration.  In addition, the Congressional Review Act currently allows Congress to disapprove ofregulations--including midnight regulations--only one at a time. A wave of midnight regulations can easily overwhelm Congress'ability to use one-rule-at-a-time resolutions as an effective check.  Finally, it is well-documented that the rush byoutgoing administrations to impose midnight rules before the clock strikes 12 leads to more poorly analyzed rules with lowerquality and lower benefits.  The Obama administration has imposed more runaway regulation than any other in memory, and itsmidnight rulemaking period is no exception. When the House considered this legislation in the wake of last November's election,the administration had issued or planned to issue at least 180 midnight rules within the scope of this bill, including multiplebillion-dollar rules and more than 20 major rules imposing $100 million or more in costs per year.  In the intervening weeks,these figures have rapidly ballooned to the 226 midnight rules issued or planned. During just the week of December 12, theadministration issued 18 midnight regulations, imposing over $2 billion in new costs. But this is not a partisan issue.Administrations of both parties have issued midnight rules in the past.  The Judiciary Committee has been searching for aneffective solution to this problem for some time, and I applaud our colleague, Mr.Issa, for offering the Midnight RulesRelief Act to respond to the need. This bill offers a simple and powerful means to stop the problem of abusive midnightrules--allowing Congress to disapprove of any and all midnight regulations in one fell swoop by one en bloc disapprovalresolution under the Congressional Review  Any outgoing administration understanding that it has this Sword of Damocleshanging over its head will surely hesitate much more before abusing midnight rules. Further, once enabled to dispatch of allimproper midnight rules with one simple resolution, Congress and succeeding administrations would be free to focus more of theirenergies on the voters' new priorities, rather than the mess left by midnight rules.  The relief offered by the bill,moreover, is highly flexible. No set number of regulations would have to be covered by a resolution. No category of regulationwould have to be included in or excluded from a resolution. On the contrary, any midnight rule disapproval resolution could besweeping or narrow, depending on how many rules merited inclusion.  Finally, the Midnight Rules Relief Act offers a solutionthat is not intrusive upon legitimate executive branch authority. An outgoing administration remains free to conduct necessaryrulemaking activity up to the stroke of midnight on Inauguration It then falls to Congress to respond swiftly andsurgically to the results, to accept the good and excise the bad.  This is truly a better way to govern. That is why thereform embodied in this bill is featured in Speaker Ryan's Better Way agenda.  I thank Mr.Issa for his work onthis important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH74.txt,446,MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,4.0,February

I was lucky enough to hire one such veteran on my team, Mike DeVilliers, who served in the U.Mike is committed to helping other veterans and has, at a local community college, where he ran a program for student veterans. He now serves my constituents, including our veterans and across the four counties in the Fifth  We should be encouraging talented and qualified young veterans like Mike to put their skills to use and give back to their fellow servicemen and -women. The VA is one place those skills are sorely needed to best serve the 473,000 veterans who live in New Jersey and the many other veterans across our country.  Mr.Chairman, approximately 60 percent of VA employees are over the age of 45, and the Department has struggled to develop an adequate pipeline for younger employees and emerging leaders to fill crucial and critical roles. We have seen the negative effects of not having the right team in place to support our veterans. While programs like Pathways at the VA are a step in the right direction, we can do more to improve the process and give a leg up to all veterans who wish to bring their skills to the  More than half of the post-9/11 veterans are 34 years of age or younger, and approximately 30 percent have bachelor's or advanced degrees; yet the Department of Labor reported that post-9/11 vets face a higher unemployment rate than other veterans. That is simply unacceptable.  The VA should draw from their excellent source of talent to strengthen the care all of our veterans receive by considering more young veterans for excepted service appointments. That is why my amendment would make sure that the VA Secretary includes recipients of the post-9/11 GI Bill and younger veterans who have recently graduated from college as a distinct category qualifying for excepted service appointments to the Department of Veterans  Mr.Chairman, the mission statement of the VA is inscribed outside the Department's headquarters. It reads: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' This is President Lincoln's promise to serving and honoring the men and women who are America's heroes, and it should and must be our same commitment today. I know of no one who stands more willing and able to serve fellow veterans and their brothers and sisters in arms than the veterans themselves.  There is nothing partisan about serving our veterans. This is a commonsense solution without any new costs, and it is a perfect example of working across party lines to help get the backs of those who have served our country.  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our veterans by supporting this win-win solution.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

13427,topic-id,2752,"Mr.President, today I come to the floor to address my colleagues about the bipartisan resolution of disapproval that I introduced on January 30, along with Senator Crapo and 24 other cosponsors. This resolution now has 32 cosponsors, and of course this resolution of disapproval is absolutely necessary.  The resolution of disapproval is a procedure, as we know, under the Congressional Review Act for repealing executive branch regulations. The regulation at issue here in this disapproval resolution was issued by the Social Security Administration under President This regulation unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. If the regulation is not repealed, it will allow the agency to very unfairly deprive Social Security recipients of their Second Amendment rights. The regulation would result in disability recipients being reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as ineligible to own a firearm and, thus, have their Second Amendment rights violated.  This is essentially a national gun ban list. The agency accomplishes this by doing two things: determining if a person has a disorder on a vague ``mental disorders'' list, and, two, appointing a representative payee to manage benefit payments.  This process has been in place for years to merely assign a representative payee. That is merely someone who is authorized to deal with the bureaucracy on behalf of that Social Security recipient to help a recipient with their finances. Now it is being used to report beneficiaries to a list so that they cannot buy or own a gun. Of course, once on that list, individuals are prohibited, as I have already inferred, from purchasing, owning, and possessing firearms, thus violating Second Amendment rights.  The regulation is flawed beyond any kind of repair. It results in reporting[[Page S1143]]people to the gun ban list that should not be on that list at all. It deprives those people of their constitutional rights and, in a very important way, violates their constitutional rights without even due process.  Under current Federal law, one must first be deemed ``mentally defective'' before being reported to the gun ban list. However, the mental disorder list in this regulation is filled with vague characteristics that do not fit into the Federal ``mentally defective'' standard.  The disorder list is inconsistent with the Federal mentally defective standard. More importantly, the list was never designed to regulate firearms. As such, it is improper to use it for that purpose.  Many of the disorders on the list are unrelated to gun safety. For example, the disorders list includes eating disorders, disorders that merely impact sleep or cause restlessness, and even disorders that could cause ``feelings of inadequacy.''  Because the Second Amendment is a fundamental right, the government must have a very compelling reason to regulate, and the regulation must be very narrowly tailored. It unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. The government is essentially saying that a person with a disability, such as an eating disorder, is more likely to be violent and should no longer be allowed to own a gun.  There is no evidence to support that general idea and, consequently, people being denied constitutional rights without due process. And if a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it. It is pretty basic constitutional law: The government should have to carry the burden before denying a constitutional right.  The National Council on Disability--and that happens to be a nonpartisan and independent Federal agency--has said this:       The rule stigmatizes a group of people who are not likely      to perpetuate the kind of violence the rule hopes to address.      Furthermore, it deprives a much broader class of individuals      of a constitutional right than was intended by Federal law.  In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union has said:       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no      data to support a connection between the need for a      representative payee . . . and a propensity toward gun      violence.  That was a quote from the American Civil Liberties  The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities--and that is a coalition of 100 national disability groups--shares the same concerns about regulations, and I will quote from them:       The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate      stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent      and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of      policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those      unfounded assumptions.  In other words, those unfounded assumptions are about who might be disabled or not.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Council on Disability,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, U.House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on      behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding      the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)      released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of      the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In      accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned      against implementation of the proposed rule because:       ``[t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to      manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,      possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only      unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with      disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the      stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a      representative payee[.]''       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.       NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on      the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of      SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming      it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues      SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and      difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to      beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule      creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long      noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do      the important work it is already charged with doing. With all      due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply      a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to      implement this rule may strain the already scarce      administrative resources available to the agency, further      impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In      this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.           Regards,                                                   Clyde Terry,                                      ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                                 February 9, 2017.     Vote YES on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.14          (Social Security Administration NICS Final Rule).     Vote NO on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.12          (Federal Acquisition Regulation/Fair Pay and Safe          Workplaces EO).       Dear Senators: On behalf of the American Civil Liberties      Union (ACLU), we urge members of the Senate to support the      resolution disapproving the final rule of the Social Security      Administration which implements the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007.       Additionally we urge members to oppose the resolution of      disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of      Defense, the General Services Administration, and NASA      relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that implement      the Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order 13673.   Social Security Administration (SSA)'s Implementation of the NICS    Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007 Harms People with Disabilities       In December 2016, the SSA promulgated a final rule that      would require the names of all Social Security Disability      Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)      benefit recipients--who, because of a mental impairment, use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits--be      submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check      System (NICS), which is used during gun purchases.       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should      not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection      between the need for a representative payee to manage one's      Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward      gun violence. The rule further demonstrates the damaging      phenomenon of ``spread,'' or the perception that a disabled      individual with one area of impairment automatically has      additional, negative and unrelated attributes. Here, the rule      automatically conflates one disability-related      characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money, with the      inability to safely possess a firearm.       The rule includes no meaningful due process protections      prior to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      The determination by SSA line staff that a beneficiary needs      a representative payee to manage their money benefit is      simply not an ``adjudication'' in any ordinary meaning of the      word. Nor is it a determination that the person ``lacks the      mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs'' as      required[[Page S1144]]     by the Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly state that      representative payees are appointed for many individuals who      are legally competent.       We recognize that enacting new regulations relating to      firearms can raise difficult questions. The ACLU believes      that the right to own and use guns is not absolute or free      from government regulation, since firearms are inherently      dangerous instrumentalities and their use, unlike other      activities protected by the Bill of Rights, can inflict      serious bodily injury or death. Therefore, firearms are      subject to reasonable regulation in the interests of public      safety, crime prevention, maintaining the peace,      environmental protection, and public health. We do not oppose      regulation of firearms as long as it is reasonably related to      these legitimate government interests.       At the same time, regulation of firearms and individual gun      ownership or use must be consistent with civil liberties      principles, such as due process, equal protection, freedom      from unlawful searches, and privacy. All individuals have the      right to be judged on the basis of their individual      capabilities, not the characteristics and capabilities that      are sometimes attributed (often mistakenly) to any group or      class to which they belong. A disability should not      constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any      right or privilege, including gun ownership.  Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Regulations Advance Worker Safety and                                  Rights       The rules implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces      Executive Order take an important step towards creating more      equitable and safe work conditions by ensuring that federal      contractors provide workplaces that comply with federal labor      and civil rights laws.       Employers that have the privilege of doing business with      the federal government must meet their legal obligations. The      Fair Pay and Safe Workplace regulations are crucial because      they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly      and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil      rights laws and that they are complying with federal labor      and employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act      (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil      Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and      the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law      equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from      forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the      Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and      sexual assault.       Congress should stand with workers, increase the      accountability of federal contractors and oppose any attempts      to undo the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations. These      rules will help ensure that the federal government does not      contract with employers that routinely violate workplace      health and safety protections, engage in age, disability,      race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other      labor violations.

Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The Co-Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of      Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a      Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the      Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)      on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require      the Social Security Administration to forward the names of      all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a      mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System (NICS).       The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the      largest coalition of national organizations working together      to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-     determination, independence, empowerment, integration and      inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all      aspects of society.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights      Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a      letter to the Obama Administration and through the public      comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed      the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.       We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community.

13428,topic-id,1022,"Mr.President, some of the supporters of the new gun ban have brought forth arguments to try to discredit the other side. They have said that repealing the agency rule will allow the mentally ill to acquire firearms.  Let me tell you why that is not true. Under this regulation, the Social Security Administration never, ever determines a person to be mentally ill before reporting them to this gun ban list. It does not provide due process before reporting them to the list. Once the agency places a person on this disorders list, it then moves to assign a representative payee. But that is a very flawed process as well.  The former Social Security Administration inspector general said the following last year in testimony before a committee about assigning a representative payee. This will be a very short quote from the inspector general: ``It's not a scientific decision; it's more of a personal opinion.''  It is quite obvious under our Constitution's due process clause that the personal opinion of a bureaucrat cannot be the basis for taking away a person's Second Amendment rights.  Further, a June 2015 internal Social Security report found significant shortcomings in the representative payee process, namely that--and I will quote from the Social Security report--``the Social Security Administration's capability determinations were undeveloped, undocumented, or insufficiently documented.''  A very legitimate question can be raised: How can any of us be comfortable allowing our fellow citizens to be subjected to such a process, a process that leads to the violation of constitutional rights? The regulation does not then require a formal hearing at any point.  Federal law and other regulations require that a formal hearing take place.  Mr.President, 18 U.S.922(d)(4) requires adjudication before depriving someone of the right to own a firearm due to mental illness. There can be no adjudication if there is no hearing.  A 1996 ATF Federal Register Notice says ``the legislative history of the Gun Control Act makes it clear that a formal adjudication is necessary before firearms disabilities are incurred.''  The Obama administration knew that fundamental rights required constitutional due process. At the bare minimum, that requires a hearing. Yet, in this rule, no hearing is being afforded to that individual that will eventually have their constitutional rights abrogated. Of course, that ought to be considered not only a travesty but a travesty on the Constitution as[[Page S1145]]well. The constitutional due process is entirely nonexistent because there is absolutely no opportunity for an individual to challenge the proceedings against them.  The American Civil Liberties Union has echoed the same concerns, stating that ``the rule includes no meaningful due process protections prior to the Social Security Administration's transmittal of the names to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database.''  The Second Amendment is very much being tossed aside without a formal dispute process to challenge the action before the constitutional right is abridged. On these facts alone, the regulation should be repealed. Yet there is more.  The regulation fails to establish that a person is a danger to themselves or a danger to others before taking away the constitutional rights the Second Amendment allows. If a rule premised on safety is to have any credibility, one would obviously think that the government needs to prove a person is dangerous, but this rule fails in that regard because it does not require the agency to find a person is, in fact, dangerous. The Second Amendment is a fundamental right requiring the government to carry the burden showing a person has a dangerous mental illness. This regulation obviously and simply does not achieve that requirement.  To be clear, however, if this regulation is repealed, Federal gun prohibitions will still exist. Individuals who have been determined to be a danger to themselves or others will still be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Also, individuals who are found to have a dangerous mental illness will be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. A person convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence will still be prohibited from purchasing, owning, and possessing a firearm. The same is true for those involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  As government expands, liberty contracts. It follows that with the expansion of government, power is centralized here, in this island surrounded by reality that we call Washington, DC, rather than with the American people. Often with that centralization of power, fairness does not necessarily follow, as demonstrated by this regulation. This Obama-era regulation is a perfect example of government wielding too much power--the power to deny people due process, the power to deny people their constitutional rights under the Second  The process described herein is extremely problematic and necessitates being done away with by the passing of this resolution of disapproval. It is not clear that any of these disorders a person is labeled with has anything whatsoever to do with a person's ability to responsibly own a firearm, and there is insufficient due process to ensure that a person actually has a given disorder that would interfere with their safe use of a firearm. Notably, even if a representative payee has been assigned, the individual still maintains the capacity to contract.  Thus, the government is subject to a very low threshold to report names to the gun list and no burden of proof is required. By contrast, under this regulation, those who are reported to the list must prove the negative. They have to prove that the government is wrong. They must prove they are not a danger in order to get their name off that gun ban list. For the government to shift the burden to the citizen whose rights are being deprived is clearly unfair and unconstitutional. The failure to determine if a person is mentally ill or a danger to self or others is a material defect to this regulation, as is the failure to afford constitutional due process. There is no reasonable basis under this regulation to justify abridging that very important, fundamental constitutional right, and that is why this regulation must be repealed through the passage of this resolution of disapproval.

13276,topic-id,359,"Mr.President, in the final hour of our legislative business early last December 10, we passed a remarkable bill. It had no ideological division, did not cost the taxpayers a dime, and will benefit Americans in every part of the country. And, like the House did, we passed it unanimously.  This bill had the somewhat unwieldy title of the Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification While not lending itself to a catchy acronym, it is accurately descriptive. For more than 50 years, a Federal law has provided legal protection for art loaned by foreign governments for exhibition in the United Confidence in that protection is an essential piece of the complex arrangements that can take years to complete in order to bring wonderful exhibits to American museums for everyone to enjoy.  America has hundreds of museums of all sorts. The art museum at Brigham Young University, for example, is one of the largest and best attended in the Mountain When it began working on a major exhibition of art from Islamic countries, some of its loan requests were unexpectedly denied. It turns out that a 2007 Federal court decision had made such loans risky, rather than secure. After that court decision, the act of lending, even after State Department review and approval, could actually lead to a new category of lawsuits against the foreign lenders.  This legislation, now signed into law, reverses that court decision and clarifies that lending art after State Department review does not raise the possibility of new litigation. Foreign governments can once again have confidence that lending art for exhibition will improve cultural understanding and enrich people's lives without the threat of new lawsuits.  The bill has two narrow exceptions. I want to thank Wesley Fisher, director of research at the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany, and Rabbi Andrew Baker, director of International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee, for their help in drafting the exception for Nazi-era claims. The second exception covers comparable state-sponsored coercive campaigns of cultural plunder.

13301,topic-id,1390,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Judge Gorsuch has been nominated to fill the seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin  Justice Scalia was a dear friend of mine, and his death was a great loss to me and to our country, not just to me personally but for the whole Justice Scalia joined the Supreme Court after years of unbridled activism by the Court, during which time Justices imposed their own left-wing views--completely unmoored from the law as written--on the American people.  In response, he led a much needed revolution based on the enduring principle that the role of a judge is to say what the law is, not what a judge wishes it were. As the intellectual architect of the effort to restore the judiciary to its proper role under the Constitution, Justice Scalia was a singularly influential jurist.  To say that he leaves big shoes to fill is an understatement. Any worthy successor to his legacy will not only be committed to continuing his life's work but also capable of delivering the sort of intellectual firepower and leadership that Justice Scalia provided for decades.  Of all the potential candidates for this position, this vacancy, Neil Gorsuch stands out as the jurist best positioned to fill this role. His resume[[Page S560]]can only be described as stellar: Columbia University, a Marshall Scholarship to study at Oxford, Harvard Law School, clerkships for Judge Sentelle on the DC Circuit and for Justices White and Kennedy on the Supreme Court, a distinguished career in private practice and at the Department of Justice, and more than a decade of service on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth  Even among his many talented colleagues on the Federal bench, his opinions consistently stand out for their clarity, thoughtfulness, and airtight reasoning. In the words of one of his colleagues appointed by President Carter, Judge Gorsuch ``writes opinions in a unique style that has more verve and vitality than any other judge I study on a regular basis.'' He continued: ``Judge Gorsuch listens well and decides justly. His dissents are instructive rather than vitriolic. In sum, I think he is an excellent judicial craftsman.''  This view of Judge Gorsuch's capabilities is broadly shared across a wide swath of legal observers. Consider some other descriptions of his qualifications from outlets that could hardly be considered conservative. The New York Times reported on his ``credentials and erudition.'' The Los Angeles Times called him a ``highly regarded . . . jurist,'' and ABC News described how ``in legal circles, he's considered a gifted writer.''  I think there can be no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the credentials to make him a capable and effective member of the U.Supreme Nevertheless, I have long held that a nominee's resume alone--no matter how sterling--should not be considered sufficient evidence to merit confirmation to the Supreme Rather, we should also consider a nominee's judicial philosophy. In this analysis, Judge Gorsuch has developed a record that should command ironclad confidence in his understanding of the proper role of a judge under the  Judge Gorsuch's opinions and writings show a clear fidelity to a judge's proper role. While his body of work is replete with examples of this fidelity, I want to point to one example in particular, a lecture he delivered last year in the wake of Justice Scalia's death that is one of the most thoughtful and persuasive cases for the proper role of a judge that I have ever read. In it, he affirmed his allegiance to the traditional account of the judicial role championed by Justice Scalia, which he described as such:       The great project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind      us of the differences between judges and legislators. To      remind us that legislators may appeal to their own moral      convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape the      law as they think it should be in the future. But that judges      should do none of these things in a democratic society. That      judges should instead strive (if humanly and so imperfectly)      to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward,      and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a      reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would      have understood the law to be--not to decide cases based on      their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they      believe might serve society best.  As Justice Scalia put it, ``If you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you are probably doing something wrong.''  This is exactly the kind of judicial philosophy we need our judges to espouse, and Neil Gorsuch is exactly the man to embody it on the Supreme If there is one line in that lecture to which I could draw attention, it is the quotation of Justice Scalia's formulation of the very basic notion that a good judge will oftentimes reach outcomes that he does not personally agree with as a matter of policy. Such a notion should be uncontroversial.  Indeed, many of Justice Scalia's brightest opinions came in cases in which I suspect he would have voted differently as a legislator than as a judge. Yet such a concept might seem wholly foreign to a casual observer of media coverage of the Supreme Court, in which cases are invariably viewed through a political lens. Decisions and Justices are regularly described as liberal or conservative, with little attention paid to rationale and methodology, the matters properly at the core of a judge's work. This phenomenon reflects a regrettable dynamic observed by Justice Scalia himself. As the late Justice observed, when judges substitute their personal policy preferences for the fixed and discernible meaning of the law, the selection of judges--in particular, the selection of Supreme Court Justices--becomes what he called a mini-plebiscite on the meaning of the Constitution and laws of this country. Put another way, if judges are empowered to rewrite the laws as they please, the judicial appointment process becomes a matter of selecting life-tenured legislators practically immune from any accountability whatsoever.  If we value such a system of judicial review, a system deeply at odds with the Constitution's concept of the judiciary, then one can easily see why judicial selection becomes a matter of producing particular policy outcomes. Thus, it is easy to see why many on the left who believe in such a system demand litmus tests on hot-button policy issues. To them, a judge is not fit to serve unless they rule in a way that produces a particular policy. Simply put, this is a terrible way to approach judicial selection. It undermines the Constitution and all of the crucial principles that it enshrines from the rule of law to the notion that our government's legitimacy depends on the consent of the government.  A good judge is not one that we can depend on to produce particular policy outcomes. A good judge is one we can depend on to produce the outcomes commanded by the law and the Neil Gorsuch has firmly established himself as that kind of a judge. In Neil Gorsuch's America, the laws that bind us are made by the people's elected representatives, not unelected, unaccountable judges. In Neil Gorsuch's America, the powers and limits of each branch of government are decided by the Constitution, no matter whether their enforcement produces a liberal or conservative outcome. In Neil Gorsuch's America, the basic freedoms of the American people enumerated in the Bill of Rights are carefully protected, whether they are in fashion lately with the left, the right, both or neither. In Neil Gorsuch's America, the views that matter are yours and mine, not those of a handful of lawyers in black robes in  For these reasons, I applaud the President for his absolutely stellar choice. Judge Gorsuch will do us proud as our next Supreme Court I will do everything in my power to ensure his confirmation. I will have more to say on this in the future, but I yield the floor at this time.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS554-4.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,1.0,January
13430,topic-id,650,"Mr.President, the Senate is now considering H.40, a resolution of disapproval regarding a misguided Social Security Administration regulation that infringes on many Americans' Second Amendment rights. As a cosponsor of the Senate companion to this resolution, which was filed by Chairman Grassley, I would like to add my voice to that of the many advocates, including the National Disabilities Rights Network and groups such as the National Rifle Association that work to protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners who have expressed support for this important legislation.  I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Grassley and others for their leadership on this issue. This ill-advised regulation not only stigmatizes individuals with disabilities, it also violates the Second Amendment and due process rights of many Americans, and it should be repealed.  As a longtime supporter of Americans' constitutional right to keep and bear arms, I was deeply troubled by this regulation, which allows the Social Security Administration to report individuals they consider, in the words used in the regulation, to be ``mentally defective'' to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, if they have ``mental impairments,'' receive disability insurance benefits, and receive those benefits through a representative payee.  When someone receives benefits through SSA's representative payee program, SSA field office employees have deemed them unable to manage their finances. However, SSA's representative payee program itself is, by many accounts, ineffectively administered.  You don't have to take my word for it. As recently as 2013, the Government Accountability Office identified that SSA ``struggles to effectively administer its Payee Program.'' There are unexplained and large discrepancies across various regions of the country that SSA serves in numbers of beneficiaries who are assigned by SSA field offices to be in the payee program. Yet, despite these known gaps and discrepancies, SSA apparently thought that this system was sufficient to determine whether some beneficiaries should be afforded a constitutional right.  Let's be clear. Under SSA's rule, individuals who are not found by SSA employees or any other competent authority to be a danger to themselves or others but rather simply need help managing their finances will be prohibited from legally purchasing a firearm. While we all want to make sure that the NICS system works effectively to prevent violent criminals and those who actually do pose a threat from purchasing firearms, this regulation is exceedingly overbroad. Moreover, it is not at all clear to me that SSA employees in field offices should be put in charge of deciding who can legally purchase a firearm. Of course, the bureaucrats at SSA who were prodded by the Obama administration to write the rule say they will create some sort of internal structure to allow beneficiaries to appeal the decisions of SSA employees. Of course, that means SSA would need to construct a new costly adjudication system to review decisions that its employees are not well-equipped to make in the first place. This is particularly strange, given that it is standard practice at SSA to decry the agency's funding levels while also claiming it is already unable to adequately serve its beneficiaries due to budgetary shortfalls.  All of this simply does not add up. The SSA is not at all equipped for this kind of decisionmaking; moreover, the standards that would apply under the regulation for SSA to report a beneficiary to the NICS represent a much lower bar than the one anticipated in the applicable Federal statutes to determine the eligibility to purchase a firearm. That being the case, we need to pass Chairman Grassley's resolution of disapproval, which has already been approved by the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this resolution.  I thank my friend from Oregon for allowing me to go forward on this short set of remarks.  I yield the floor.

Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, it is with great disappointment that I rise to address the treatment of Judge Neil Gorsuch by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  Today marks the close of his confirmation hearing, which began on This hearing was extraordinarily thorough, examining just about every facet of his record and his life.  The nominee himself delivered an outstanding performance, enduring more than 20 hours of intense questioning over 2 very long days. He displayed an impressive command of the law and the kind of intelligence one expects of someone with such stellar credentials. He showed the proper understanding of the role of a judge in our constitutional system of self-government: to apply, not make, the law. He demonstrated this crucial quality both in his affirmative answers and in the times he had appropriately refused to prejudge issues that might come before him. Throughout, his demeanor was serious, thoughtful, and humble. These qualities have defined his service as a judge for the last decade and will serve him well on the U.Supreme  As for my fellow Senators, many of them approached this hearing the right way, posing questions that gave us real insight into the nominee's record and judicial philosophy. Thanks to their hard work, Judge Gorsuch has now been vetted as extensively as any nominee to come before the Senate in the whole length of my service here. I thank them for their careful work and good judgment.  In particular, I want to single out my friend and colleague Senator As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he was charged with the monumental task of planning and executing the whole endeavor. He performed admirably, and we all owe him our sincere gratitude. He is one of the best people here, and he is totally honest and decent.  Regretfully, I feel compelled to contrast that responsible approach of many of my colleagues with the actions of a number on the other side of the aisle. Frankly, some of the treatment of Judge Gorsuch has made me ill. In him, we have a man who is superbly qualified and who quite obviously understands how his job is to say what the law is, not what he wishes it might be. In fact, I do not believe any fair examination of the whole of his[[Page S1964]]record on the bench can reasonably yield any meaningful clues as to what his policy views are. He is the kind of nominee whom, in an ideal world, we should be able to confirm by universal acclamation. Yet that is not the sort of treatment we are seeing--far from it.  Instead, we see a desperate campaign being waged against him to derail his nomination at all costs. This is the sort of approach that has long been advocated for by many far-left activists intent on attacking in their belligerent ways and stacking the courts with ideologues committed to imposing liberal policies without respect for what the law and the Constitution actually command.  As someone with great respect for all of my colleagues--even those with whom I often disagree--I had hoped they would resist the siren song of their activist base and give Judge Gorsuch a fair shake. Unfortunately, I see many of them falling prey to the temptations of this scorched-earth approach. Whatever their motivation--be it the outcome of the Garland nomination, the apparent unwillingness to accept the results of the election, or the desire for judges to push their political agenda--many of them appear willing to employ tactics they used to recognize, rightly, as inappropriate and even dangerous. In doing so, they threaten to inflict lasting damage on the judiciary, the Senate, and our politics more broadly.  Consider their demand that Judge Gorsuch answer politically charged hypotheticals about potential future cases. For decades, nominees of both parties have refused to comply, so much so that the practice is then referred to as the ``Ginsburg standard,'' after current Justice Ginsburg, and they had been quite right to do so. To offer an advisory opinion that is inconsistent with the Constitution's allocation of powers--which give judges the authority to decide only actual cases and controversies, not offer broad advisory opinions--is inconsistent with the core characteristic of the judicial process, which considers issues in the particular legal and factual context of an individual case and gives parties the opportunity to make their arguments in full, and it asks judges to prejudice themselves when they should be arbiters, raising serious due process concerns for future litigants who deserve a fair hearing.  Having participated in 14 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees, I fully understand the temptation to ask these kinds of questions. Indeed, I have seen many Senators of both parties fall prey to the temptation, only to have a nominee politely respond about how it would be inappropriate to answer.  It is one thing to make the occasional mistake of this variety and move on. I have seen it happen countless times, but that is not what happened this week. Instead, I witnessed many of my colleagues devote almost their entire half hour rounds to posing these sorts of inappropriate questions. When Judge Gorsuch responded appropriately and explained his inability to answer--oftentimes with an extensive explanation of the rationale for doing so--he was lambasted by some of my colleagues for his refusal to engage in this dangerous practice.  Worse yet, these harsh attacks came from Senators who I have seen gladly embrace the very same answer from nominees in the past. What they once demanded, they now reject. What they once avoided, they now embrace. Simply put, it is hard not to interpret their attacks as hypocrisy of the highest order.  This is a completely illegitimate line of attack on Judge Gorsuch, and it should be repudiated forcefully.  Consider also the way in which some of my colleagues misrepresented Judge Gorsuch's record. It involved just a few simple steps. First, cherry-pick one of the judge's opinions in which a sympathetic victim lost; next, gloss over the legal issues at hand that mandated the outcome Judge Gorsuch reached; then, fail to mention how he was often joined in these opinions by his colleagues appointed by Presidents Clinton and Obama; after that, fail to mention the many times Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of litigants similar to the one who lost in the case at hand; finally, make a wild assertion and accusation about how that case shows how Judge Gorsuch is biased against ``the little guy.''  We should call these phony attacks for what they are: bogus attempts to mischaracterize his record intentionally.  Any fair analysis of the record Judge Gorsuch has established on the bench can lead to only one conclusion: He is the type of judge who will reach the result commanded by the best reading of the law, free from any political agenda.  He follows his oath to do justice without respect to persons. As Judge Gorsuch himself rightfully put it, quoting Justice Scalia, ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.''  There will always be times when the law produces a result we disagree with. That is a simple fact of life. Sometimes that is our fault for not writing the law better, but the appropriate response is to change the law, not to demand that a judge ignore the law to reach a result we like.  As legislators, it is, by definition, our responsibility to change the law to produce better, more just results. If my colleagues think a law like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is producing bad results, it is their right to try to change it. They can count on me fighting tooth and nail to protect religious liberty, but at least they will be doing their job as lawmakers, not shirking it and demanding that unelected judges do their dirty work, nor impugning the honor of good judges like Judge Gorsuch who refuse to ignore the law on behalf of a political agenda.  In Judge Gorsuch, we have a Supreme Court nominee as fine as I could ever imagine. He is the type of man we all should be clamoring to step into the late Justice Scalia's big shoes. But instead of the best traditions of the advice and consent process that many of us have tried to live up to, what is he treated to? Hypocritical attacks on the very judicial independence that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim to prize above all else, misleading attacks that distort his record, and now a promise to filibuster his nomination by the minority leader. My gosh, what have we come to around here?  I remember when Justice Ginsburg went through with only three votes against her and not much debate, and she refused to answer any of the questions that my friends on the other side were demanding of Judge Gorsuch and of other Republican judges. Frankly, I stuck up for her and felt that was the right thing for her. I have great respect for her because of the way she handled those proceedings and others as well. We didn't do this in earlier years. It has become so radical around here and so political around here that we are besmirching the very people who have become the judges in this land and are doing such a good job.  This is a travesty of the highest order. Judge Gorsuch is a brilliant, decent man who has devoted his life to serving his country. He has done exactly what we want as a careful judge for more than a decade. What does he get when nominated to the highest Court in the land? He gets his name dragged through the mud. He gets baited with questions we all know he cannot answer, that nobody can answer. If they are not trick questions, they are certainly improper, and then he is attacked for not answering. He gets his record mischaracterized and is accused of cruelty and hardness of heart. He gets the kind of treatment that leads him to regret putting his family through what ought to be a dignified process.  It is time to stop this madness, stop the dishonest attacks. Instead, let's have a debate worthy of the world's greatest deliberative body and confirm this absolutely outstanding nominee.  If my friends on the other side would treat somebody as respectable and highly prized and praised as Judge Gorsuch and treat them the way he was treated in some instances in these hearings, may we bar the door on the next nominee of this administration. That will be Armageddon, I guess, and we can't let this body descend into that sort of catastrophe.  I will insist on our nominees being people of the highest order, like Judge Gorsuch, people who will make us all[[Page S1965]]proud, people who will respect both sides but who will enforce the law, and people who, when it becomes time to change the law, can properly make that decision and have the guts to do it. There aren't many cases that have to be changed, however. All I can say is there are some that both sides wish would be changed, and on both sides.  All I can say is this: I hope our colleagues will treat this President's nominees with greater respect. I have always tried to treat their nominees with great respect, and I helped get them through. Justice Ginsburg had only three votes against her, if I recall correctly. It was very few votes. There are judges who are now on the bench who I couldn't support, but I didn't stop them from having a vote up or down. Frankly, there are judges on the Circuit Court of Appeals whom we allowed to come up and whom I personally would not have approved as a President or otherwise but who were picked properly by the Democratic President and who had enough good recommendations on their side to sit on the bench. I think that is what has made this country a great country--that we understand that there are different points of view, not just in politics, but with regard to the law itself. And all of us have to understand that and realize that when somebody's elected President, that person, whether he or she, deserves to have fair consideration of the judicial nominees.  It is no secret that President Obama put almost 50 percent of the Federal bench on the bench, and he had a lot of up-and-down votes on them. Yes, there were some notable differences and notable debates, but by and large, the President got whomever he wanted. And I have to say that in the past, Republican Presidents generally got whomever they wanted. But in the intervening number of years since Roe v. Wade, we have had nothing but big problems that I think have resulted in the denigration of the bench and which should never have occurred.  I hope my colleagues, all of whom I deeply admire and like, will take some of these things into consideration and treat Judge Gorsuch with the true and deliberate respect that he deserves. I hope they can bring themselves to vote for him because he is truly a wonderful man, a great father, a wonderful husband to his wife, a tremendous person from the West, a fly fisherman, a fellow whom every one of his law clerks deeply loves, and a person who, by any measure, is one of the brightest judges in the country today. I can't really think of anybody who would be brighter than he is or any better than he is.  So Donald Trump picked one of the best people, if not the best person in America, for this job, and I hope my colleagues on the other side will recognize that in spite of their dislike, and sometimes even hatred, for Donald Trump, this is important. And it is important that we start handling these matters with greater dignity, greater fairness. When we really do disagree, fine; let's have a debate and battle on it, and let the chips fall where they may. But not all of these deserve to be in that category, and certainly Judge Gorsuch does not deserve to be in that category. He is an absolutely outstanding person.

13302,topic-id,958,"Mr.President, it hasn't even been 2 weeks, and President Trump has already demonstrated that he has little tolerance for independent thinking and dissent. He has his own version of reality, which is why his administration resorts to alternative facts.  When the media accurately reported how small the crowd was at his inauguration, he presented us with alternative facts. When the media pointed out he lost the popular vote by the largest margin of any President, he boldly proclaimed, without any evidence, that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally. Many consider this whopper as a cynical way to encourage more States to pass voter suppression laws justified by the bogus claim of widespread voter fraud.  Just 2 days ago, the President again showed the American people how intolerant he is of principled dissent when he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she refused to enforce or defend his totally unjustifiable, knee-jerk, and probably unconstitutional Executive order on Muslim immigration.  By firing Sally Yates, the President demonstrated once again that he values loyalty to himself above service to the American people and adherence to the This is particularly disturbing as we begin to consider the President's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to sit on the Supreme  I am only beginning to scrutinize Judge Gorsuch's record, but I am very concerned that he will be a rubberstamp for President Trump's radical agenda. You don't have to take my word for it. You only have to listen to what the President has been saying[[Page S561]]over the past 2 years. In June 2015, then-Candidate Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper that he would apply a pro-life litmus test for his nominees to the Supreme He did it again at a press conference last March, during the third Presidential debate, and shortly after his election.  This isn't the only litmus test President Trump promised to apply. In February 2016, President Trump committed to appointing a Justice who would allow businesses and individuals to deny women access to health care on the basis of so-called religious freedom. In February 2016, President Trump told Joe Scarborough he would make upholding the Heller decision on guns another litmus test for his Supreme Court nominee. Like tens of millions of Americans, I am deeply concerned that President Trump applied each of these tests before he nominated Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme  In the weeks and months ahead, I will carefully and extensively scrutinize Judge Gorsuch's record. I will question him on his judicial philosophy and how he interprets the I will insist he clarify his position on a woman's constitutionally protected right to choose, on voting rights, and the appropriate balance between corporate interests and individual rights.

The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Stream Buffer Rule  Mr.Mr.President, for the last 8 years, the Obama administration has pushed through a number of harmful regulations that circumvent Congress, slow growth, shift power away from State and local governments toward Washington, and kill a lot of jobs. Even on the way out the door, the former administration's regulatory onslaught continued as they pushed through more midnight regulations. These nearly 40 major regulations, which were pushed through by the Obama administration since election day, would cost Americans a projected $157 billion, according to one report.  Fortunately, with a new President, we now have the opportunity to give the American people relief and our economy a boost. One of the most important tools we have is the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to provide relief from heavyhanded regulations that hold our country back.  The House just took an important step by sending us two pieces of legislation that will reassert congressional authority and make a real impact for the American people.  One of those resolutions will address a regulation that puts U.companies at a competitive disadvantage to private and foreign companies. Passing this resolution will allow the SEC to go back to the drawing board so that we can promote transparency, which is something we all want, but to do so without giving giant foreign conglomerates a leg up over American workers. We will take it up soon.  The other resolution, which we will take up first, will address an eleventh-hour parting salvo in the Obama administration's war on coal families that could threaten one-third of America's coal-mining jobs. It is identical to the legislation I introduced this week and is a continuation of my efforts to push back against the former administration's attack on coal communities.  Appalachian coal miners, like those in my home State of Kentucky, need relief right now. That is why groups like the Kentucky Coal Association, the United Mine Workers Association, and 14 State attorneys general, among others, have all joined together in a call to overturn this regulation.  The Senate should approve this resolution without delay and send it to the President's desk. The sooner we do, the sooner we can begin undoing the job-killing policies associated with the stream buffer rule. This is not a partisan issue; this is about bringing relief to those who need it and protecting jobs across our country. I hope our friends across the aisle will support our Nation's coal miners and join me in advancing this resolution.  After we address these regulations, both the House and the Senate will continue working to advance several other CRA resolutions that can bring the American people relief.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS554-4.txt,1844,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,1.0,February

13415,topic-id,1304,"Mr.Speaker, I must hasten to add that the gentleman from California added a little comment that ``it is known.'' I don't share that view, Mr.Speaker, that it is known that the Affordable Care Act is failing.[[Page H2170]]  In fact, we had a hearing yesterday when the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office appointed by Democrats testified on the Affordable Care Act and testified on the American Health Care Lo and behold, Mr.Speaker, Mr.Elmendorf agreed with the present CBO In other words--and everybody in America ought to be pleased on this because they all are asking for bipartisan--the former Director appointed by Democrats of the CBO agrees with the Republican Director of the CBO, who just came down with his advice and counsel to the Congress just a few days ago.  That ought to give pause to those who are pressing to pass a bill, which would result in the loss by 24 million Americans of their insurance and would result in the increased costs to almost every American of their insurance.  Now, yes, there are some Americans who would choose not to have health care. Then they would get sick or they would get in an automobile accident or something else would happen where they would require medical care, and they would not be able to pay for it. Guess what? We would all pay for it.  That is what was happening before the Affordable Care It is still happening with some who choose either to pay their contribution toward health--some people call it a penalty; I call it a contribution--to meet their personal responsibility, as the Heritage Foundation suggested, of having provisions that, if they get sick, they will be able to pay for it.  Now, last week, Mr.Speaker, the majority leader had some quotes from people who did not like the Affordable Care At this hearing that we had, we had a number of people, and I want to quote some of them:       I certainly never imagined I would have a child who would      rely so much on a government program like  This child, Mr.Speaker, suffers from Rett syndrome, which is a neurology disorder that strikes mostly young girls with normal development for the first 18 or 24 months of their life. Then their development is arrested and, in fact, in some respects, there is a retreat in their abilities.  She went on to say:       Medicaid provides skilled nursing care, which allows us to      raise our daughter, Caroline, in our home instead of a      hospital or institution.  Of course, a hospital or institution would be far more expensive, Mr. She went on to say:       This allows my husband and me to hold jobs and take care of      other family needs. The House Republican plan for Medicaid      would put my daughter's life at risk, and my family is      terrified.  That was Marta Conner, mother of a child with Rett syndrome covered under  I titled yesterday's hearing: The hearing that the Republicans refused to have on the American Health Care Act or the Affordable Care Act itself.  This quote is by a doctor:       In public debate in Congress, the actual people can be      obscured by graphs and numbers. But, ladies and gentlemen,      every day in clinic, I am one-on-one with the real people,      real Americans who could take steps closer to health or      suffer more with this Congress' decision. I urge you and your      colleagues to reject the American Health Care Act and,      instead, strengthen the Affordable Care  To that extent, Mr.Speaker, as the majority leader knows, that testimony joined hundreds in the medical field: The American Medical Association, associations of physicians with particular skill sets, of hospitals, of insurance companies, of patients, of providers, of urban hospitals, suburban hospitals, rural hospitals, and literally hundreds of people intimately involved in the healthcare system who are urging us not to pass the American Health Care Act and to leave in place but improve the Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, I have indicated to many on this side of the aisle that we are prepared to work to improve any piece of legislation that has been passed and particularly a piece of legislation which affects so many Unfortunately, we have not had that opportunity since this bill, the Affordable Care Act, was first considered and passed.  This week, the Congressional Budget Office released their estimate and impacts of the House Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, as the majority leader knows, President Trump, in this body and at that rostrum, promised insurance for everybody that is much less expensive and much better. He has not offered such a bill. The American Health Care Act certainly does not provide that.  In fact, the CBO--both Republican and Democratic directors--opined at least 24 million people will lose their insurance and, by 2026, there will be 58 million people in America without health insurance.  Mr.Speaker, the majority leader has indicated this bill will be on the floor next week. I hope that everybody takes the opportunity to read the CBO report and the testimony given in yesterday's hearing on the bill. It was the first and only hearing that was held on the bill that will be on the floor. Previous hearings on the Affordable Care Act are not good, and previous hearings that there are alternatives out there don't deal with the bill that is going to be on the floor next Wednesday or  Senator Susan Collins has said of the bill that is going to be on the floor:       It should prompt the House to slow down and reconsider      certain provisions of the bill.  She was referring, of course, to the CBO report.  Senator Bill Cassidy from that liberal leftwing bastion of Louisiana said:       Can't sugarcoat it. Doesn't look good. The CBO score was,      shall we say, an eyepopper. I also hope it was a thought      provoker.

Mr.It seems as though the gentleman has a little short-term memory of how they brought the Affordable Care Act and the CBO report when it came before us. It was not brought before us until it came right before the floor.  But let me follow through on all your questions because my response back was, I was actually excited to hear that Democrats wanted to work with us, that their attitude has changed from when we were in committee and they had amendments going forward, that it was no longer going to be hashtag amendments, it was actually going to be productive amendments; and I thank you for having that change of attitude.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud of the transparent process we have taken in the House, and I think this needs to be reminded to all the American public.  As I mentioned last week, our healthcare bill is the result of 113 hearings. I know the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, he is proud of the 72 hearings they had before they did the Affordable Care  We have now marked up this bill in three separate committees, with over 18 hours of debate in Ways and Means, and over 27 hours of debate in Energy and Commerce, and the countless amendments from both Republicans and  By the time we vote on the floor, this bill will have been publicly available online for 3 weeks. Now, it is only 127 pages. That is a far contrast to the 2,700-plus pages, if you want to compare it to  So far, nearly 590,000 people have visited our website, and over 200,000 have downloaded this legislative text.  So, Mr.Speaker, that means more people have read our healthcare bill than went to I call that transparency. Republicans have been committed to repealing and replacing ObamaCare for years, and so now I think it is time to act.  The gentleman also commented about the Well, I am actually excited that you had another person who confirmed what the CBO said because what the CBO says about this bill is it will lower the deficit by $337 billion.  It will also reduce premiums by 10 percent by 2026, and it will secure major entitlement reform by capping Medicaid spending, giving States certainty and flexibility, saving taxpayers $880 billion, and making the program solvent for future generations, because that was a concern in one of the letters.  Now, Mr.Speaker, those are the facts. With regard to the coverage numbers, the CBO reports that most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with individual mandates. Let me repeat that. Most of the increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate.  Now, that makes sense to me, because if we no longer force Americans to buy something they do not want, one-size-fits-all health care, they will naturally choose not to buy it.  But, Mr.Speaker, I know the gentleman across the other side of the aisle argues with me about the knowledge that everybody knows ObamaCare is failing. I would ask the gentleman to visit one-third of the counties in this country that only have one option.  Or why don't you go to Tennessee, where the President just was because, you know, 16 counties in Tennessee have no option. But ObamaCare will penalize you for not having health care when you can't even buy it.  But if ObamaCare was working so well, why do more people accept the penalty or the exemption than actually buy ObamaCare? That is a number that is quite interesting. That is why I am encouraged to see our plan will decrease the average premiums that people have been asking for.  Now, our goal is not just to sign up people for insurance. Our goal is to get America better health care.  Now, the gentleman also commented and had letters--and I love to read letters. I love to listen to constituents because that is what our work should be. And you read a letter when it came to And I would not scare people, I would actually talk to that individual.  Medicaid is on an unsustainable path. In one 10-year window, it will cost $1 trillion.  Mr.Speaker, the gentleman on the other side knows what $1 trillion is because that is about the entire amount we spend on discretionary spending. From all of the appropriations that we go through, that would take up everything we have.  Well, we know that is not sustainable, so we should do something about it. That is why we had a meeting with 18 Governors, Republicans and And the number one thing they told us, give us flexibility to be able to manage. That is exactly what this bill does.  But I like to read some letters. Here is one from Colleen from Annapolis:       I just received the notice for my 2017 health insurance      policy. It will skyrocket, not by the advertised Maryland      State average of 20 to 25 percent but, rather, by 60 percent.      In addition, my deductible is going up 45 percent. Since the      inception of ObamaCare, my policy has increased 75 percent.       I am a 63-year-old female in excellent health who takes no      medication. My only benefit from the ACA has been two      mammograms, which I paid $12,600 in premiums to get. What a      disaster of a program.       I will be voting Republican this year, in the hope of      finally getting the ACA repealed. I just hope it happens      before my checkbook goes on life support.  Or the letter to the editor from Carl in Lusby, Maryland:       I can't afford my health insurance now under      It's been a burden on our joint income, which is just above      the limit for qualifying for subsidies; and for 2017, I am      facing a 61 percent rate increase.       I'm faced with either paying a premium that will bankrupt      me and my wife, or paying the tax penalty at the end of the      year, which will also be unaffordable. And there are probably      several million Americans who are in the same boat as I am.  You know what, Carl? We listened to you. We listened, and now we are going to lead. We have moved a bill from the legislative process to the rules, what it says, for reconciliation. We have done hours of debate in three other committees. We will continue the process, as the rules say. We will go to the Rules Committee and then we will come to this floor. And for those who have written, change will come.  Yes, the Republican-appointed CBO Director and the Democratic CBO Director, as the gentleman, Mr.Speaker, from across the aisle says, agree that the premiums will go down, as so many Americans have asked for. We will put Medicaid on a sustainable path.  We will give Republican and Democrat Governors flexibility so they can manage their States in a better form. And most importantly, we will give America exactly what they asked for, the freedom to choose their own health care, the options of having more so they can direct what they want and desire, at the same time, having a lower cost.  So I welcome the gentleman for his questions. I know that wasn't about scheduling, but I think this is too important, because those 113 hearings we listened to the people before us, and we promised we would act, and we are keeping that promise as we move forward.

13419,topic-id,853,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information. People, I am sure, listening to this colloquy must get confused because they hear one representation from somebody who sounds pretty reasonable, my friend, Mr.McCarthy, and then they hear exactly the opposite from me. So they will have to make a judgment.  The bill that is going to be on this floor next week was introduced a week ago It was marked up less than 42 hours later.  My friend, the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, said: I love to listen to constituents. Not a single constituent on his side of the aisle or my side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, had the opportunity to testify on this bill. Not a single one of my constituents, or the majority leader's constituents, had the opportunity to know what the CBO said was going to happen; that 24 million people[[Page H2172]]would lose their insurance, 14 million next year; that Medicare would be put at risk; and Medicaid would be gutted by 2021. Not a single constituent was listened to because they had no opportunity to come and say: this is what I think.  The testimony to which I referred was yesterday. I don't know the dates on the letters that the gentleman just read, but perhaps they were just within the last few days.  But I will tell that 63-year-old woman that what this bill does, if you got a 60 percent increase, will up that by 66 percent because you are going to go from a 3-to-1 ratio to a 5-to-1 ratio on which seniors, and 63 years of age, regrettably, from my standpoint, are referred to as seniors. The bill that is going to be considered will allow the insurance company to do a 5-to-1 ratio, rather than a 3-to-1 ratio, so that 60 percent is going to go up by 40, maybe get to 100 percent.  Mr.Speaker, the American people know about transparency. That means they can see something.  The gentleman says: Well, now it is online. Yes, they had 40 hours, give or take, to see this bill from Monday night to Wednesday, when it was marked up, and it was marked up and passed in the Ways and Means Committee in the dead of night, sort of like they passed the prescription drug bill, at 5:59 in the morning. The majority leader wasn't here. I was here. Perhaps there is a predilection to middle of the night. By the time the Energy and Commerce Committee passed it, they had been in session for over 24 hours and were bleary-eyed.  As I told him last week, Mr.Speaker, my folks were not up at 4 a.m. watching the Energy and Commerce And I would tell him further that--he said the bill was now online and people had an opportunity to read it. Perhaps, Mr.Majority Leader, Mr.Speaker, that is why the Affordable Care Act has now got more support from the country than it has had at any time since its existence; where there are 49 percent of Americans who now like the Affordable Care Perhaps the reason that is happening now is because they have had the opportunity to see the alternative that the Republicans have offered and are offering on                              {time}  1215  This bill that they offered is going to significantly raise--I will tell Colleen--her out-of-pocket expenses.  And, yes, under their bill, the CBO says that perhaps the premiums will go down. Why will the premiums go down? Why does insurance go up and down? Because the risk goes up and down; and the greater the risk, the more the cost. But if you don't allow people who are sick people to get into the system because they can't afford it, then the risk goes down. When the risk goes down and you shut people out of the system and 24 million people are out of the system, yes, of course, the rates go down because you are insuring the healthy.  Now, Americans know that very well because they know they have automobile insurance--which, by the way, they are mandated to have in almost every State, if not every Why are they mandated to have it? So the rest of us are protected when we have an accident or we are protected from our rates going up because there is not a broad spectrum of the insured so that the risk can be minimal for the insurance company.  So I say to my friend that CBO has told the truth. The Americans are seeing that, and they don't like that. I would urge those on the other side of the aisle to be very careful when they vote either Wednesday or Thursday on this bill because this bill is going to have a very detrimental effect on the American people.  Now, I understand there are going to be two other bills. There are going to be four bills on the floor, as I understand it. Can the gentleman inform us of when we will see the details of this additional legislation?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr.I ask the gentleman which bills he is referring to?

13422,topic-id,484,"Lastly--and I know you are glad to hear that comment, as are the folks waiting to do 1-minutes--we have received a letter from Secretary Mnuchin on March 8. It was directed to the Speaker, Mr.Leader, and like most Secretaries of the Treasury, he is hoping that we will pursue financially responsible and confidence-building policies.  I won't read the whole letter, but he says in the last paragraph: ``As I said in my confirmation hearing, honoring the full faith and credit of our outstanding debt is a critical commitment. I encourage Congress to raise the debt limit at the first opportunity so that we can proceed with our joint priorities.''  Mr.Speaker, I ask the majority leader whether that is going to be scheduled in the near term because, on March 15, we met the debt-limit extension. This administration and every previous administration have taken steps to prolong the time before we default by using extra mechanisms so that we are, in effect, not investing in the retirement system or something else and paying our debts.  I have indicated publicly, Mr.Speaker, and I reiterate here, that I will urge my side to support a debt-limit extension if it is clean. What I mean by ``clean,'' if it does not incorporate something that is not agreed to and there is not a consensus on. By that I mean, simply, if there are things that we have a consensus on that need to be passed, certainly including those in the debt-limit extension would not be objectionable. But if there are items in that bill designed to force us to vote for what is a responsible policy but takes something that we obviously very strongly disagree with, we will not do so.  So my questions to the majority leader are: A, can we expect a clean debt-limit extension? B, can we expect that in the near term, as Secretary Mnuchin requests, so that we can put that matter behind us and not undermine confidence in our fiscal posture as a nation?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I think we both agree that responsible fiscal policy is important to our country's ability to succeed, and that includes honoring the full faith and credit of the United We expect to continue working closely with Secretary Mnuchin to ensure that America is on the right path to a strong fiscal future.  We know the amount of debt that has been added in the last 8 years has been tremendous. I know that the gentleman, when he looks to what we do next week--to be able to lower premiums, save more than $300 billion of the deficit, and let people have more choice--that is also a first step.  Now, I do not have any immediate action to announce, but we will relay any information to the Members as we move forward.  I thank the gentleman.  Is that going to be your last question?

13425,topic-id,485,"I guess the answer to that question, Mr.Speaker, is what will determine an upset. Will the American people be upset? Will the Republicans be upset? The answer to that question remains in the hands of our Republican colleagues, because what I want to do in observation, I disagree with all three of the propositions that the majority leader said in his closing statement.  This is not going to reduce the budget. Yes, on its face, they give a $600 billion tax cut to the wealthiest in Where do they take it from? Medicaid, some of the poorest people in That is where that money comes from.  Premiums are going to go up. Deductibles are going to go up. You can quote me on this 2, 3 years from now. I don't think your bill is going to pass. But if it did pass, that is what would happen. You won't be able to test me because I don't think the bill is going to pass. It may pass this floor, but it will not become law.  The majority leader's statement, Mr.Speaker, that that is what the American people are expecting, I disagree with that. What the President of the United States said he was going to give to the American people is insurance for everybody. The majority leader ignores the 24 million. He hasn't spoken about that. He spoke about some other observations in the CBO report, as did Speaker I don't blame him. I would try to point to some positive indicators myself.  I think this is going to up the deficit, it is going to up costs, and it will decrease the insured and make hospitals have more uncompensated care. We will have this debate next week, Mr. But on the last issue, I would hope, Mr.Leader, that we do agree on fiscal responsibility. I happen to believe, as you know, the debt limit issue is a phony issue, a totally political issue. It has been used as a political issue on both sides of the aisle. There should be no question but of course the United States is going to pay its debt, of course the United States is going to pay people whom it has bought things from, and of course it is going to pay people moneys that they have been promised. Of course it is going to do that. This is not about new spending. It is about spending that we have already incurred.  I would urge the majority leader to bring a clean bill to the floor. I will work with him. We will get the overwhelming majority of Democrats to vote for that. Let's not blame one another for the debt. There is plenty of opportunity to do that, and both sides are guilty of that result.

13355,topic-id,609,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, floor debate isboth for the people in the room and the people watching.  Many of the new Members have not yet voted on a substantive pieceof legislation. So, Mr.Speaker, I reach out with a little piece of history--a large piece of history, perhaps--for the freshmenof both parties.  First of all, this legislation is bipartisan. It is sponsored by both Republicans and  Secondof all, when Mr.Conyers, Mr.Nadler, and I were 16 years younger, in March of 2001, it was the last and only timethat the underlying law allowed for a regulation to be repealed. It was prominently called ergonomics. It was repealed. I hadthe honor of voting for that as a freshman.  Since that time, in spite of the many regulations that some people don't like inone party or another, we have not seen fit to have a joint resolution repeal a regulation.  So let's talk about what it takesto do that. It takes both Houses of the Congress and the President of the United States to repeal a regulation created by abureaucrat, or many bureaucrats--a regulation that may or may not be consistent with the law passed by this body, by the Senate,and by a President in this or a previous  Again, for the freshmen, we are the body that creates laws, and we do sothrough a complex and difficult procedure. We pass it out of the House or We then pass it out of the other body. If thePresident signs it, it then still is subject to court challenge.                              {time}  1400  Now, let's go through the regulatory process: Proposed by a bureaucrat, given a period of time in which dissenters may be100 percent, and still it becomes law if this body does not act. So now that gives you a little feel for the underlying law.Used once on a bipartisan basis to take back an unpopular regulation that has never been resubmitted under both 8 years of aRepublican and 8 years of a Democrat in the White House, and I repeat, the regulation that was previously recalled was so inerror that it has never been redone in 16 years by two  Now, let's talk about the bill we have before us today.We all know that the House is a body that, when it wants to, can move fairly quickly, and the Senate is a body that seeminglymoves quickly only in recess. The fact is that the Senate takes a long time, and we have many regulations that may or may not beconsidered now or in the future.  All this legislation does is allow for us to dispose of one or more regulations in anexpedited fashion in this body and have it seen in the same form in the Nothing more than that. It doesn't change theunderlying law. It doesn't change the fact that the House, the Senate, and a President must concur on taking back what isessentially a law--that is what a regulation is--created by bureaucrats not elected by any of us. So let's keep it as simple asthat.  For the freshmen of either party, when you go to make a vote on this, remember, we are not changing the underlyinglaw. Only one regulation under the underlying law has ever been repealed, and it was bipartisan in both the House and the Senatewhen it was repealed. It has been 16 years, and the few that will likely be considered under this act and the underlying lawwill be just that, a relatively few regulations that are believed to be unnecessary and for which the House, the Senate, and thePresident concur.

From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly      $900 billion in regulatory costs on the Americanpeople which      requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these      regulations have been or will be imposed on the      constructionindustry. ABC is committed to reforming the      broken federal regulatory process and ensuring industry      stakeholders' voices areheard and rights are protected. ABC      supports increased transparency and opportunities for      regulatory oversight by Congress andultimately, the American      people.       The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that      detrimentally impact theconstruction industry. In some cases,      these regulations are based on conjecture and speculation,      lacking foundation in soundscientific analysis. For the      construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary      regulations translate to higher costs, which arethen passed      along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being      priced out of the market. This chain reactionultimately      results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to      hire and expand.       ABC members understand the value ofstandards and      regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with      appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs      andinput from the business community. Federal agencies must      be held accountable for full compliance with existing      rulemakingstatutes and requirements when promulgating      regulations to ensure they are necessary, current and cost-     effective for businessesto implement.       ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations      resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucratswho have      little accountability for their actions. H.26 will help to      bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process asit      would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an      annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come      beforeCongress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       DearRepresentative: On behalf of the National Association      of Manufacturers (NAM), I am writing to express      manufacturers' supportfor the passage of H.21, the      Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017, introduced by Congressman      Darrell Issa (R-CA).       The NAMis the largest manufacturing association in the      United States, representing small and large manufacturers in      every industrialsector and in all 50 states. Manufacturing      employs nearly 12 million men and women, contributes more      than $1.8 trillion to theU.economy annually, has the      largest economic impact of any major sector, and accounts for      two-thirds of private sectorresearch and development. The NAM      is the leading advocate for a policy agenda that helps      manufacturers compete in the globaleconomy and create jobs      across the United       The Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 would amend the      Congressional ReviewAct to provide Congress the authority to      consider one joint resolution of disapproval for regulations      en bloc as opposed to asingle regulation at a time. As the      end of an Administration approaches, there is an incentive      for federal agencies to issue asignificant number of      regulations. These are known as midnight rules, and H.21      would allow Congress to effectively respond toregulations      that conflict with congressional intent, exceed an agency's      statutory authority or are hastily drafted and issued asan      Administration prepares its departure.       The problem of midnight rules is not new and is not unique      to a particularpolitical party. As an administration attempts      to complete its regulatory agenda, an abundance of midnight      rules can overwhelmCongress' ability to engage in proper      oversight of federal agencies. Midnight rules can be issued      without justification andwithout an agency conducting proper      regulatory analysis. Congress should be granted the authority      needed to appropriatelyrespond to the issuance of a midnight      rules that might not be drafted in accordance with sound      regulatoryprinciples.

Thank you for yourconsideration.

Republicans are expected todelay repealing      parts of Obamacare to allow for more time to design a      replacement health care plan. President Obama is expectedto      meet with Congressional Democrats on Wednesday as well to      discuss plans for defending Obamacare from repeal.       Last week theDepartment of Justice (DOJ) announced that      they had reached final agreements with Swiss banks on the      Swiss Bank Theprogram aims to help financial      institutions avoid criminal liabilities due to U.tax      crimes by granting banks non-prosecutioneligibility if they      meet certain requirements. The Swiss Bank program was      initially announced in 2013.               Eakinomics: The Regulatory Cleanup Begins       The tally has been mounting for years--over 3,000costly      regulations totaling nearly $875 billion in finalized burden      costs. As the economy became increasingly festooned withrule      making and regulatory drag, conservatives have promised to      bring the regulatory state to sanity given the      firstopportunity. That moment has presumably arrived.      Congress returns from the holidays with plans to get started.       Specifically,I expect that the House will begin cleaning up      the midnight regulatory onslaught by the Obama      administration. Historically, thiswould have required a      regulation-by-regulation use of the Congressional Review Act      (CRA). Instead, the House will consider abill (HR 5982 in the      last Congress), which would permit Congress to disapprove      multiple midnight rules en banc--in a singleresolution.       That takes care of the last-gasp efforts of the outgoing      president. But what guarantees better performance in      thefuture? The House will next turn to the Regulations from      the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) With the REINS      Act,Congress would have 70 legislative days to approve a      major rule with economic impact over $100 million. Only then      would it besent to the president for signature. Without a      positive vote, the regulation would not take effect. If      enacted, REINS could savemore than $27 billion in annual      regulatory costs and 11.5 million paperwork burden hours      according to AAF research by       Passage of the REINS Act (or other, similar, legislation)      would insert Congress more firmly into the regulatoryprocess,      a significant change that is not done lightly. However, the      lesson of the past eight years is that even withoutexecutive      overreach the regulatory process does not correctly balance      benefits and costs; a recalibration of the underlyingprocess      is overdue.                                                  Small Business &                                     Entrepreneurship Council,                                       Vienna, VA, January 3,2017.     Darrell Issa,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear RepresentativeIssa: The Small Business      Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly supports the      ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.'' Thislegislation is vital as it      provides a needed check against the surge in new and      questionable regulatory activity that isflooding into the      Federal Register, which will eventually make its way to small      businesses.       While ``midnight regulations''have been a problem across      Administrations, what is happening in the current period is      staggering. According to the AmericanAction Forum, the      current output of midnight rules is up 42 percent over 2008,      and 48 percent over 2000. This regulatory surgemust be      ``checked'' and contained by Congress before it causes      permanent damage to the competitiveness of many types of      smallbusinesses.       The end-game push on the regulatory front will undoubtedly      show that shortcuts were taken in a process meant toprotect      small businesses. Mercatus Center research found that the      quality of analysis suffers during the midnight      regulatoryperiod, which means these regulations are      ``excessively costly'' or ineffective. Poorly constructed and      politically-drivenregulation will only create more      uncertainty and costs for our nation's struggling small      businesses.       Your legislation willprovide Congress with needed      flexibility in using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by      allowing a CRA resolution to addressmore than one regulation.      This important reform enhances the CRA and allows Congress to      use its time efficiently to address themany issues that face      our economy and nation.       Thank you for your continued leadership on issues important      to entrepreneursand[[Page H83]]     small businesses. Please let us know how we can help to      ensure the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act'' is signed intolaw.

Particularly egregious were his recent announcements      onenergy and environmental policy: He rejected the permit for      the Dakota access pipeline, exempted wind farm companies      fromkilling eagles, abused the Antiquities Act to remove      western lands from economic development, and prohibited      federal offshoredrilling and mineral leases on millions of      acres across the country, including 115 million acres off the      coast of      This flurry of regulatory activity is simply the latest in      a long line of overreaches from the Obama White      Theoutgoing president has consistently sought ways to enact      his agenda unilaterally over his two terms--notoriously      ``working aroundCongress'' in order to do so. A recent report      from the American Action Forum found that the Obama      administration issued 600major regulations totaling $743      billion over the course of his presidency. This is an average      of 81 majorregulations--regulations that exceed $100 million      by agency estimates--per year.       Thankfully, the House of Representatives ispoised to hit      the ground running in slowing the growth of the regulatory      state. Representatives will consider two importantbills on      the floor as one of their first orders of business for the      year. Both bills, once passed by the Senate and signed      byfuture President Trump, will bring meaningful relief to the      American families and businesses across the country who      arecurrently drowning in red tape.       The first bill, Darrell Issa's Midnight Rule Relief      Act, is particularly important giventhe onslaught of      regulations coming from the White House and the scarcity of      available floor time in It would allowCongress to      disapprove of multiple so-called ``midnight rules''--     regulations finalized in the waning days of      theadministration--using a single Congressional Review Act      (CRA) resolution, as opposed to disapproving of these rules      individually.This change will make it easier for Congress to      disapprove of the Obama administration's recent spate of      economically dangerousactions.       The second bill, the Regulations from the Executive in Need      of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, is also important. This wouldrequire      executive agencies to submit ``major'' rules--those with an      annual economic impact of $100 million or more--to      Congressfor review and a clear up-or-down vote before the      rules take effect. This would assert Congress's proper role      in approving therules that govern the country, an authority      which has been increasingly delegated to executive agencies.      It would also encouragemore debate among lawmakers about the      size and scope of the federal government. Incoming Todd      Young championed thisimportant legislation during his time in      the House; it's good to see Doug Collins introduce it in      this new      Both of these bills received bipartisan support in past      Congresses; they may enjoy even more in this current      one.Strange bedfellows could emerge in anticipation of the      Trump presidency. Democrats in Congress who want to limit the      ability ofa Republican White House to enact new rules, as      well as Republicans who principally support limiting the size      and scope ofgovernment.       Americans across the county voted for President-elect      Donald Trump and a Republican majority in Congress      becausethey are tired of President Obama's harmful regulatory      agenda. It's little surprise that President-elect Donald      Trump swept rustbelt states and the upper Midwest in the      recent election--these parts of the country have been      devastated by President Obama'sregulatory overreach, and they      stood to lose even further under the threats of a Hillary      Clinton administration.       Congress isright to reverse President Obama's regulatory      assault on job creation and economic growth in this county,      and it should workclosely with President-elect Trump in      peeling it back. Representatives should support the two      regulatory reform bills when theycome up on the floor this      week, and they should seek additional efforts to overturn      these myriad rules, including futureCongressional Review Act      resolutions of disapproval and adding appropriations riders      that would prohibit funding forimplementation of the worst      rules, while executive agencies promulgate new rules to      eliminate them.       Doing so will send astrong message that lawmakers are      willing to stand up to the executive overreach of the past      eight years.

13373,topic-id,772,"Mr.Speaker, the fact is we are hearing many people talk about importantregulations and of their somehow being taken out. Let's understand that regulations can go both ways. These changes and theunderlying law can also protect the other way. The fact is now we are in the future. You could have an administration that, inits final days, changes regulations to make them more lenient to large businesses, more lenient to polluters, more lenient tothe employers to the detriment of their employees. Regulations can go both ways, and only the most extreme regulations--literallyone since the enactment of the underlying legislation--has ever been repealed.  I don't want to belittle my own legislation,but let's understand that there won't be 61 en bloc being brought. There will be some, I hope, and there may be more than one.Yet for Congress to take back, piece by piece, its responsibility and then live up to that responsibility should be all of ourgoals.  Now, this legislation was limited to midnight rules. Let's understand that midnight rules are the rules done in thewaning days of an administration--7-plus years into this administration--and many of these rules, in fact, were enacted after thelast vote of the people. I think it is important to understand that, on election day, the American people delivered a resoundingmessage to Washington: stop the regulatory, Big Government onslaught that is killing jobs.  One of my colleagues earlierspoke of the fact that we had had so many jobs--15 million jobs--created in the last 8 years. The percentage of the workforce thatis working in America today is the smallest in my lifetime. It is smaller than it was 8 years ago, 16 years ago, or 21 yearsago. We are not creating jobs at the rate of our population. We should not have some sort of an accolade for regulations havingcreated a great economy if, in fact, that economy has grown less than 2 percent a year and has not kept up with any historic 8-year period. To me, that is an important part. Although the discussion I just had was about more than regulations, let'sunderstand that the growth of regulations--of lawmaking--is certainly not the creator of jobs.  I think, when we look at thecost--and that is a lot of what we are dealing with in the manager's amendment in this bill--we are dealing with the recognitionthat we are looking at regulations in light of how much they cost. Now, that cost is based on independent scoring. It is not theadministration's scoring and it is not my scoring. It is that of the Congressional Budget Office's, an independent agency thatdoesn't always give a score I want, but the score is not arrived through partisan activities.  I reach out again to theMembers who may not yet know that what we are asking is simply to assert our normal ability in Congress and put together one ormore ideas for the efficiency of the body, to send it from here to the Senate, and from the Senate to the What we areproposing in this legislation as a small change to the underlying legislation that has been with us for three Presidents is, infact, consistent with this body's doing its job, in regular order, in the clear light of day.  I think the important messagefor this piece of bipartisan legislation is: we are taking back a limited amount of our capability, trying to streamline it, andgiving the President an opportunity to accept or reject a piece of legislation voted on by a majority of the House and amajority of the Senate before it gets to the The President, if he feels we have included even one regulationinappropriately that he would like to retain, would veto our bill.  Lastly, I beg everyone to look at this for what it is,not for what others say it is, because it is simply Congress doing its job in an efficient fashion and consistent with 20-plusyears of history and with there being only one piece--one time--when a regulation was withdrawn. No President since that time hastried to produce or has asked Congress to pass a law so as to put into effect a regulation that, on a bipartisan basis, theHouse, the Senate, and a President thought should go. I urge the support for this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back thebalance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

So, in order to pass it today, because she did not set it up to excludethese items and have them immediately considered, I cannot support her motion to recommit.  What I will say is that when welook at regulations to put into a package that may be a package of one or a package, if this passes, of more than one, Icertainly will expect that those regulations will have to do with things which could have been done sooner, would have been donesooner, and were done in the waning days of the administration for no reason that was time sensitive.  The Affordable CareAct was passed in the first days of the administration. If there is something in the last days of the administration that hasmerit, I certainly would urge my colleagues not[[Page H86]]to rescind that regulation. But if there is something that should have beendone in year one, two, three, four, five, or six, I would ask why it wasn't done then.  Having said that, it is unfortunatethat this motion to recommit was written in a way that would send it back to committee and, thus, cause a substantial delay.  I would caution my colleagues that, at least from this Member, if you have a motion to recommit and you want the amendmentitself considered, make it one that is immediate and not back to committee. The difference, I think, is important. TheParliamentarian simply can advise on how to write one that would prevent it having to get, if you will, another delay of days orweeks.

13258,topic-id,493,"Mr.Presidents, a skilled workforce is essential to addressing the growing cyber security challenges in the United The Department of Defense, DOD, Cyber Strategy, issued in April 2015, cites building the cyber workforce among its objective's for achieving the essential strategic goal of maintaining ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations. In Virginia, it is estimated that 36,000 cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled.  Beginning in 2001, DOD funded the Information Assurance Scholarship Program, IASP, vhich boosts the Nation's cyber workforce through scholarship and capacity-building grants to colleges and universities designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as Centers of Academic Excellence, Scholarship recipients are required to fulfill a service obligation by working in a cyber security position at DOD upon graduation.  According to a DOD report from February 2015, the IASP Program had employed 593 students and awarded 180 capacity-building grants to However, due to budget constraints, DOD reduced funding for the IASP beginning in 2013 and stopped recruiting new students. The IASP received its peak funding level of $7.5 million in 2005--for fiscal year 2017, it received $500,000.  Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Rounds, the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act of 2017. The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act of 2017 would reinvigorate the IASP to boost our Nation's cyber workforce. The bill would rename the IASP as the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program and express the Sense of Congress that the program is an important tool for boosting our cyber defense workforce.  The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act would also modify the program by expanding scholarships to students pursuing Associate's There are currently 46 two-year institutions designated as CAEs, which would be eligible to apply for grants. Associate's degree programs could provide a valuable source of technical personnel, at a lower cost, to The bill would require that at least 5 percent of scholarship funds go to 2-year program students.  The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act would authorize the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program to receive $10 million in fiscal year 2018. At its peak in 2005, the IASP received $7.5 million. Since then, the cost of tuition has increased considerably and the need for skilled cyber professionals has never been greater. Ten million dollars is an appropriate funding level to reinvigorate the program, expand it to associate's degree recipients, and allow for manageable program execution from DOD and the National Security  The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help students succeed in today's economy and strengthen our national security. There are good-paying jobs in Virginia and across the country in the cyber field that are going unfilled, and it is clear we must make it easier for students to access the programs that prepare them for these roles.

Today is National Freedom Day, when we recognize President Lincoln's signing the 13th Amendment banning slavery. This is the reason we celebrate Black History Month in  Today, February 1, begins American Heart Month, acknowledging the great heart of the American people, as well as the need for health care.  But today, February 1, is also the first day of World Interfaith Harmony In 2010, King Abdallah II of Jordan spoke before the U.General Assembly, and he asked the U.to declare a week every year to promote understanding and tolerance between the world's religions. In his speech before the U.N., this is what King Abdallah said:       It is also essential to resist forces of division that      spread misunderstanding and mistrust, especially among      peoples of different religions. The fact is, humanity      everywhere is bound together, not only by mutual interests,      but by shared commandments to love God and neighbor, to love      the good and neighbor. What we are proposing is a special      week, during which the world's people, in their own places of      worship, could express the teachings of their own faith about      tolerance, respect for others and peace.  The resolution was adopted unanimously at the U.General Assembly, and all nations, religions, and peoples were asked to observe it.  By happy coincidence, as the Presiding Officer knows, King Abdallah is in Washington right now. He visited with Senators here at the Capitol yesterday and today. Earlier today I met with him, and I told him I would speak in his honor in the hopes that his words might inspire us at a challenging time.  The word of last Friday's Executive orders regarding immigration and refugees--orders which implemented the President's campaign rhetoric to implement a Muslim ban--shocked the country this weekend. I traveled to Roanoke and Blacksburg, VA--communities in the southwestern portion of my I was there to meet with local health care providers and students pursuing health care careers. I had planned the trip to go talk about the Affordable Care Act, but at my first event, two families came to me with a concern. Working together with Roanoke Catholic charities, they had helped settle a Syrian refugee family in Blacksburg 1 year ago. The Syrian family was a mom and dad and four kids. These sponsors told me how well the family was doing and how welcoming this community was in bringing this family to Virginia and taking them in.  The employer of the Syrian father runs a construction company, and he hired him to do construction work. He told me, kind of chuckling about it: Senator, not all my workers agree with me on politics, but no one better say a[[Page S557]]bad word about their Syrian coworker around them.  He went on to describe how the employees at his construction firm had done a number of things, including collecting funds to help the children have soccer shoes there, in Southwest But they didn't tell me this story because it is a happy story about resettlement of a family, although that is a point of the story.  Here is why they came to see me. The community was poised to welcome a second family from Syria--a mother, father, and five minor children--to meet them at the Roanoke airport tomorrow and help them find a home in the United This refugee family they were supposed to meet tomorrow fled Syria 4 years ago. They had been living in a refugee camp in Jordan, undergoing 4 years of vetting in the hopes they could come to Now, their sponsors pressed papers into my hand and said: What will happen to this family? Are they now shut out of the dream they have worked so hard to achieve? Are we now shut out from our desire to offer them the Christian hospitality of our community?  We have been working to get answers to these questions, but as of today, we know nothing about this family's fate.  There are so many questions I struggle to answer in the aftermath of these orders. The orders single out people based on their Muslim faith by targeting primarily Muslim nations and allowing exceptions to be made for Christians and other religious minorities. Why?  The orders single out seven countries--countries where citizens have been exposed to genocide and other crimes against humanity--while leaving countries that have actually exported terrorists to the United States untouched. Why?  The order was applied to legal permanent residents of the United States until clarified and also to brave people who had helped American soldiers on the battlefield, thereby earning a special immigrant visa status. Why?  We can have security procedures that are based on the danger of an individual rather than a stereotype about where they were born or how they worship.  I am called to reflect on these events by King Abdallah's words suggesting that the world should recognize this week as World Interfaith Harmony He told us today that the order is being viewed with deep anxiety in his country, which is one of our strongest allies in the Arab world--indeed, in the entire world. I am called to reflect on these events by my own citizens in Roanoke and Blacksburg, working with a church group, who just want to serve others in a way commanded by their faith and by all faiths.  At the Presiding Officer's desk, there is a book of the rules of the Senate and there is also a In a week where all are called to reflect upon their own religious traditions of tolerance and peace, there is wisdom in that Book for our  Exodus 22:21: ``You shall not wrong or oppress an alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.''  Leviticus 19:34: ``The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself for you were aliens in the land of  Deuteronomy 1:16: ``Give the members of your community a fair hearing and judge rightly between one person and another whether citizen or resident alien.''  Deuteronomy 10:18-19: ``For the Lord your God loves the strangers, providing them with food and clothing. You shall also love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.''  Deuteronomy 24:17: ``You shall not deprive a resident alien or an orphan of justice.''  Deuteronomy 26:5: ``A wandering Aramaean was my ancestor, he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien.''  Matthew 2:13-23: Jesus began his life as a refugee in  Matthew 25:34: ``I was hungry and you fed me. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you invited me into your home.''  The traditions of this nation, other nations, religions, and peoples point us in the same direction. Pope Francis reminded us of these very words when he spoke to us in the fall of 2015 and told us--as individual leaders and as a nation--that the yardstick we use to measure and evaluate others is the yardstick that will be applied to us.  On this opening day of World Interfaith Harmony Week, I pray that we commit to peaceful understanding and appreciation of people from diverse faith backgrounds. I pray that the unjust immigration orders that target suffering people based on where they were born or how they worship will be rescinded. I pray that Congress and the administration will work together to set up appropriate security procedures that do not discriminate on the grounds of religion or national origin, and I pray that we will be true to our best principles and not sacrifice them for the sake of politics.

For women of color, that gap is larger. Even in my own district, the Eighth Congressional District of Illinois, where the overall disparity is smaller, women still only earn 83 cents on the dollar.

13296,topic-id,1199,"Mr.President, we began public hearings on the Supreme Court nominees in 1916. Since we began those, the Senate has never denied a hearing or a vote to a pending Supreme Court nominee--never, since 1916 until last year.  Last year Senate Republicans waged an unprecedented blockade against the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland, a fine judge with impeccable credentials and with strong support from both Republicans and Democrats, a man who should be on the Supreme Court today. This is the first time since 1916 that had ever been done. Instead, bowing to the extreme right of their party, Republicans who knew him and who even had said publicly before how much they respected him and how he should be on the Supreme Court refused even to meet with him, let alone accord him the respect of a confirmation hearing--even though the Constitution says that we shall advise and consent and even though each one of us has raised our hand in a solemn oath saying we will uphold the  So this is exactly what happened. The Republicans held hostage a vacancy on the Supreme Court for a year so that their candidate for President could choose a nominee. The blockade of the Merrick Garland nomination was shameful, but I think it is also corrosive for our system of government. Candidate Donald Trump, who verbally attacked a sitting Federal judge in what Speaker Ryan called ``a textbook example of a racist comment,'' encouraged Senate Republicans to ``delay, delay, delay.'' Candidate Trump then went further. He said he would[[Page S556]]outsource the vetting of potential nominees to far-right organizations, many of them lobbying organizations, that want to stack the judiciary with ideological conservatives who are outside the mainstream. He promised a nominee who would overturn 40 years of jurisprudence established in Roe v. With the selection of Judge Gorsuch, it appears as though he is trying to make good on that promise.  When we confirmed Judge Gorsuch for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals--and I was a Member of the Senate at the time--I knew he was conservative, but I did not do anything to block him because I hoped he would not impose his personal beliefs from the bench. In fact, at his confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Gorsuch stated that ``precedent is to be respected and honored.'' He said it is ``unacceptable'' for a judge to try to impose ``his own personal views, his politics, [or] his personal preferences.'' Yet, just last year, he tried to do that. He called for important precedent to be overturned because it did not align with his personal philosophy.  From my initial review of his record, that I have just begun, I question whether Judge Gorsuch meets the high standard set by Merrick Garland, whose decisions everybody would agree were squarely within the mainstream. And with the ideological litmus test that President Trump has applied in making this selection, the American people are justified to wonder whether Judge Gorsuch can truly be an independent So I intend to ask him about these and other important issues in the coming months.  Republicans rolled the dice last year. They subjected the Supreme Court and the American people to a purely political gamble. They ignored the Constitution and did something that had never been done before in this country.  I know President Trump likes to boast that he won the election in a massive landslide. Well, of course he didn't. Secretary Clinton received more than 2.8 million more votes from the American people than President But more importantly, due to Senate Republicans' political gambit, the U.Supreme Court clearly lost in this election. This is really no way to treat a coequal branch of government, and it is certainly not the way to protect the independence of our Federal judiciary--something that is the bedrock of our Constitution.-  The President's electoral college victory--which was far narrower than either of President Obama's victories--is hardly a mandate for any Supreme Court nominee who would turn back the clock on the rights of women, LGBT Americans, or minorities; or a nominee who would use theories last seen in the 1930s to undermine all we have accomplished in the last 80 years. If he follows these right-wing lobbying groups who helped vet him for the President, if he follows what they want, then critical programs, like Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, key statutes, including the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Clean Air Act, could well be at risk.  So after nearly a year of obstruction--unconstitutional, unprecedented obstruction--I really don't want to hear Republicans say we now must rush to confirm Judge I know the President thinks they should, but I also wonder how seriously even he takes this. His announcement yesterday was like he was announcing the winner of a game show: I brought in these two people, and now here is the winner. We are talking about the U.Supreme Court; treat it with the respect it deserves.  For all of the Republican talk of Democrats setting the standard with the confirmations of Justice Sotomayor and Kagan, they ignored the standard they set in the shameful treatment of Chief Judge In fact, I remember when--and I was chairman at the time--when we set the schedule for the hearings and the vote on Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and I remember the Republican leader rushing to the floor and saying: Oh, this is terrible. You are rushing it. You are moving it so fast.  I pointed out that we were setting the schedule to the day--to the day--the same as we set for Chief Justice John So I asked the obvious question: Are you telling me the schedule was OK for him but not OK for her? We followed the schedule.  We need time to look at all of these nominees.  I would note, as one who has tried cases in Federal courts, as a lawyer, and as one who has chaired the Judiciary Committee, I would say the courts are a vital check on any administration, especially one that, like this one, has found itself on the losing side of an argument in Federal court in only its first week--they lost on something that a first-year law student could have told them they were going to lose. But with great political fanfare, the President issued an order. Fortunately, the order was seen for what it was: No Muslims need show up in our country.  Judge Gorsuch, to be confirmed, has to show that he is willing to uphold the Constitution even against President Trump, even against the lobbying groups the President had vetting him.  His record includes a decade on the Federal bench. The Judiciary Committee must now carefully review his decisions. We have to conduct a thorough and unsparing examination of his nomination. That is what I will do, just as I have done for every nominee--everybody currently on the Supreme Court and many before them. Whether nominated by a Republican or a Democrat, I did a thorough and unsparing examination of their nomination. The Senate deserves nothing less. More importantly, the American people deserve nothing less.  I yield the floor.

The Midnight Rules Relief Act would provide Congress with an important toolto begin the process of dismantling the onerous regulatory burdens imposed over the past 8 years.  As the chairman of theSubcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, I have dedicated considerable time over the past 2 years toclosely monitoring the growth of the administrative state. The estimated regulatory costs across all years of the Obamaadministration are staggering. However, the regulatory onslaught in its final year alone--disastrous--shows the damage alreadydone and the greater impact that will fall on our economy.  In 2016, 401 regulations were finalized. The total compliancecost for this period exceeds $164 billion and amounts to nearly 121 million paperwork hours. That is 401 regulations and $164billion. This is only during the final year of the Obama administration. It is no wonder that the American people sought a new,more promising direction for our country.  Finally, the Congress has an opportunity to act to protect the American people andrepeal many of these crushing regulations. For us in Congress, we cannot forget what these numbers represent. For myconstituents and for Americans across the country, the billions in dollars of costs imposed on the economy represent jobs lost,routine bills that cannot be paid, and the American Dream slipping from their grasp.  The true story of this regulatoryonslaught is told by workers at shuttered stores, factories, and power plants across the country. Their concerns and fears areours. As this current administration exits, we must remain vigilant to last-ditch efforts at crippling our economy.  On topof those in recent months, a number of new regulations may still be finalized in a hurried, nontransparent fashion. The Americanpeople are concerned that our current regulatory process ignores the balancing of costs and benefits and the regulatory impacton their lives. From what we have seen over the past 8 years, it is clear that they should be.  Starting this week, Congresshas an opportunity to reassert its constitutional authority and act for all The Midnight Rules Relief Act is a well-advised measure that gives Congress the ability to quickly examine and eliminate the mass of regulations promulgated in recentmonths.

13476,topic-id,425,"Mr.Chair, I thank Representative Wenstrup for his thoughtful amendment, and I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for bringing it to the floor today.  Clearly, there are staffing shortages within the Department of Veterans Affairs, and, clearly, something must be done. Personally, I think this legislation is a good first step toward improving the VA's ability to identify staffing shortages, recruit and retain high-quality employees, and onboard new hires.  The amendment I am offering today speaks to the identification of staffing shortages portion of this bill. Under current law, 38 U.S.7412 to be exact, the inspector general of the VA is required to submit a report to the VA Secretary annually highlighting the five personnel occupations with the largest staffing shortages throughout the After receiving this report, the Secretary is then permitted to recruit and directly appoint qualified individuals to fill those vacancies.  Section 2 of the bill before us does something important to current law. It will require the IG to report on not just the five occupations with the largest staffing shortages, it will require the IG to report on the five clinical and five nonclinical occupations with the largest shortages in the Additionally, it will require this reporting to be done for each medical center. Mr.Chair, I think this is a wonderful change, one that is sorely needed.  What my amendment would do is add to this expanded reporting requirement a simple clarification: the IG must report on, at minimum, the five clinical and nonclinical occupations with the largest staffing shortages at each facility. It would allow the IG to report on more than the five occupations with the largest shortages, should his findings require it.  This amendment is not an additional reporting requirement. It simply makes clear that should the IG find additional staffing shortages, he may highlight those so that the Secretary may fill them more quickly. It is a simple attempt to avoid the necessity of passing similar legislation 2, 3, or even 4 years from now.  Our veterans need the care that they have earned and that they deserve. They need it now. The first step in that endeavor is making sure that the VA staffing levels are adequate.  Again, Mr.Chair, I am pleased to see this amendment on the floor today and to do my small part in ensuring that veterans get the care they need.

13432,topic-id,2074,"Mr.President, I have heard my Republican friends tell those[[Page S1147]]of us who want the laws of this country changed to protect our constituents against gun violence that what we should focus on is enforcing the existing law; that we don't need any new laws, all we need to do is focus on enforcing the existing law.  Senator Wyden said he wished he had a nickel for every time he has been told our focus should be on background checks. Well, I wish I had a nickel for every time my colleagues told me we should focus on enforcing the existing law. Yet I would also be a rich man if I had a nickel for every time Republicans came to the floor and tried to undermine the existing law, tried to rewrite the existing law to make it harder to enforce it.  The Appropriations Act is, on an annual basis, loaded up with riders that hamstring enforcement agencies, don't allow them to actually enforce existing laws. The CRA we have before us today will make it harder for the Federal Government to do what we have told them to do for decades, which is to put dangerous people and people who are seriously mentally ill on the list of those who are prohibited from buying guns. That is the existing law. The existing law says that if you are convicted of a serious crime or you have a serious mental illness and you have gone through a process by which a determination has been made by a government agency as such, that you should not be able to buy a weapon.  Why do we have that law on the books? Why have we come together as Republicans and Democrats to say that people with serious mental illness or people who have been adjudicated of a violent crime shouldn't be able to buy weapons? It is because the evidence tells us over and over again that if you have committed a violent crime, you are likely--more likely than if you haven't committed a violent crime--to commit another one. And over and over again, as we have seen these mass shooters walk into places like Sandy Hook Elementary School or a movie theater in Colorado or a classroom in Blacksburg, we know that people with serious mental illness in this country can go buy a very powerful weapon and do great damage with it.  That does not mean there is an inherent connection between mental illness and violence. In fact, we know the opposite to be true. If you are mentally ill, you are probably more likely to be the victim of violence than you are to be the perpetrator of it. But we do know that in this country, given the fact that weapons are so easy to come by, people with mental illness--serious mental illness--who have an intersection with visions of violence often do great harm. So we made a collective decision as Republicans and Democrats that if you have a serious mental illness, you probably shouldn't be able to go and buy an assault weapon. That is what the law says.  Section 101 of the NICS Improvement Act is titled ``Enhancement of requirement that Federal departments and agencies provide relevant information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.'' That is a piece of legislation which both Republicans and Democrats supported. It commands that Federal agencies provide relevant information to the criminal background check system.  What is relevant information? ATF defines someone who should not be able to buy a gun as one who ``lacks the mental capacity to manage his own affairs.'' So there is the existing statute. The existing statute says that relevant agencies should forward information to the criminal background check system on individuals who are prohibited from owning guns, and that is defined in part as an individual who ``lacks the mental capacity to manage his own affairs.''  That is exactly what the regulation proffered by the Obama administration at the end of last year does. It says that individuals who have filed a claim for disability, who meet the requirements of one of Social Security's mental disorders listing of impairments, have been found to be so severely impaired that they are unable to work, and have been found, with due process, to be incapable of managing their own benefits and have had a representative appointed to them to manage their disability benefits, that those individuals meet the definition of someone who lacks the mental capacity to manage their own affairs.  If you are supporting this CRA today, then you are undermining the ability of law enforcement to do their job to enforce the law as Congress has passed. So spare me this rhetoric about passing no new laws because we should just focus on enforcement. Once again, with this CRA, you are undermining the ability of the Federal Government and of law enforcement to enforce the law.  Let's be clear about what the danger is. It is correct to state that there is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being dangerous, but the risk is not just that an individual is going to buy a gun and use it themselves; the risk is that someone who literally can't deposit their own paycheck probably can't or likely can't responsibly own and protect a gun.  I could sit here for the rest of the day and recite the number of times a gun owned by one individual got used in an accidental shooting, got taken illegally, stolen from their premises, and used in a crime. The danger of an individual who has severe mental incapacity is not just that they are going to take that weapon and fire it but that they are not going to own, keep, and protect it responsibly. If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you are going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm?  We are talking about a very limited group of individuals here--who, by the way, under the regulation, have due process to contest the determination. First of all, they have an ability to contest the determination by Social Security that they shouldn't be able to manage their own financial affairs, and then the regulation secondarily gives them the ability to specifically contest their limitation on gun ownership. So there is full ability for the individual or for the family to contest this limitation, which makes it completely constitutional. Nonsense that this is a restriction of a constitutional right.  The Heller decision, which does hold that an individual has a right to gun ownership, also makes it explicit in Justice Scalia's opinion that there are limitations on that right, and the Scalia decision itself lists as one of those conditions the restriction of gun ownership by people who are seriously mentally ill.  The law is clear that Federal agencies are required to upload information onto NICS of those individuals who cannot manage their own financial affairs because of mental illness. The Supreme Court is clear that this is entirely constitutional. So why are we doing this? Why are we having a debate about rolling back the criminal background check system when 90 percent of Americans support it?  No matter what State you live in, sit down with your constituents and tell them that you voted to allow people who are seriously mentally ill to be able to buy guns. You are not going to get a lot of takers. And it is not because people don't have compassion for people with mental illness. I have worked for the last 2 years to pass the most substantial mental health reform act that this body has seen in a decade. I have spent as much or more time than anybody in this Chamber advocating for the rights of people with mental illness and for their treatment. But I also understand that when people are so mentally ill that they can't manage their own financial affairs, they probably shouldn't buy a gun. That is a small class of people.  What makes me so angry about this is I have no idea how to go back to the people whom I represent in Connecticut and tell them that in the 4 years since the massacre in a smalltown elementary school, not only has Congress passed no law, made no change in statute to try to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of would-be shooters, but that today we are doing exactly the opposite. The response to the epidemic of mass shootings in this country is to make it easier for people with serious mental illness to get guns. How do I explain that to people in Connecticut?  How do the folks representing areas where shootings are a regular occurrence explain that Congress has done nothing to address mass shootings, to address the epidemic rates of gun violence in our cities, and yet we think it is so important to undermine the criminal background check system--not strengthen it, undermine it--that in the first month of this new administration and this new Congress, we are[[Page S1148]]rushing through this repeal of a commonsense regulation? That is deeply offensive to the majority of Americans, who think we should be strengthening our criminal background checks system, not undermining it. Ninety percent of Americans think we should have universal background checks. Not only are we not listening to them, we are undermining the criminal background checks system today.  I get that the gun lobby is pretty powerful in this place. I get that they have stood in the way of changes in our criminal background checks system that were supported by 90 percent of But even I wasn't cynical enough to think they had so much power that they could get Congress to roll back, to undermine the criminal background check system in the wake of this continued horrific level of gun violence all across the country.  Senator Wyden is right. The danger in this is not just that it has the immediate impact of undermining the criminal background check system, but it potentially blocks our ability to get this right in the future. We don't know what the precedent is for CRAs because we haven't done them before. What we know is that it says you can't pass any regulation that is substantially similar to the regulation that you legislated on. Well, what does that mean in the context of keeping people with serious mental illness off the criminal background check system? Does that mean we can't ever legislate or regulate on the narrow issue of individuals who have had their right of financial affairs restricted through Social Security, or is that a broader prohibition that limits the administration's ability to regulate on strengthening of the criminal background check system in a much more comprehensive way?  We are playing with fire here because this is a precedent we know nothing about. We are playing with fire because we are potentially limiting the ability to ever get this issue right in the future when 90 percent of Americans want us to work together on it.  I understand this issue is a sensitive one. Having spent my entire career working hand in hand with committed advocates for people with mental illness, I understand the danger of conflating mental illness with violence. But this is a narrow category of individuals who by definition fit the parameters in existing law for those who are supposed to be on the NICS system.  For all the things that we disagree about on gun policy--I don't suspect we are going to get a meeting of the minds this Congress on whether all gun sales should be subject to background checks. I don't suspect we are going to figure out a way to work together on restricting access to high-capacity magazines or assault weapons. I thought at least we agreed on keeping the background check system that we have.  The existing law says that individuals who lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs should be included on the list of those who are prohibited from buying weapons, and today we are undermining that existing law. We are undermining the enforcement of current statute--something Republicans have said over and over again they are not interested in doing.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this measure.  I yield the floor.

13454,topic-id,2499,"Mr.President, at this hour, we still don't know what the House of Representatives is going to do. They are amending and changing and modifying the reform of one-sixth of America's economy under the cover of darkness, trying to secure the votes necessary to fulfill a political promise. We await their decision as to how much havoc they wreak.  I wanted to come down to the floor today to address for a moment the exceptional process that is occurring right now, as we speak, in the House of Representatives and to talk about one of the reported changes they are considering before sending the product over to the  Just to review for a minute, Speaker Ryan likes to talk about his approach to healthcare as a three-pronged approach. Well, the Congressional Budget Office, headed by a gentleman handpicked by the Republican House conference, agrees that it is a three-pronged approach; they just have a little bit different interpretation of those three prongs.  First, they say higher costs--15 to 20 percent spikes in premiums for everybody right off the bat and then dramatically higher costs, especially for older people, sicker people, and poorer people. If you are young and if you are relatively affluent and healthy, you may make out a little bit better under this proposal, but if you are not in that category, you are going to pay a lot higher costs and get less care.  This is the headline from the CBO report: 24 million people lose health coverage. That is catastrophic. That is the total population of 17 U.We just kick them off health insurance without anywhere to go other than our emergency rooms.  Remember, all of this is in order to finance a giant tax cut for the rich. I had a chart up here yesterday that showed that in this bill, if you make zero to $200,000, you get no tax cut, but if you make over $200,000, you get a nice, healthy tax cut. It could be up to $7 million on average for some of the wealthiest taxpayers. So there will be higher costs for everybody, except for maybe a very small slice of the population, but with less care. I mean, it is a nightmare when it comes to the number of people who lose care under this bill, all in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.  That is the background on what TrumpCare is and what the American Health Care Act is. People hate it. I mean, people hate it. There is a new poll out by Quinnipiac University that shows stunning numbers. The approval numbers for this bill are under 20 percent.  Republicans kicked the living you know what out of the Affordable Care Act, and they never got its approval ratings down to under 20 percent, as has happened to the American Health Care Act in its third week of existence. That is pretty impressive, for 18 percent of Americans to approve of a bill that has only been out there for a few weeks. And it is not because they don't know anything about it; over 50 percent of Americans don't like it, 18 percent support it, and 56 percent don't support it. Across demographic groups, across age groups, everybody hates this thing because they get it. They are not dumb. They know that this is taking healthcare from them and passing along higher costs to them in order to finance a tax cut for the rich. It is pretty simple. People really didn't need a lot of time to understand it.  Republicans in the House know that as this thing hangs out there, it is getting less popular. It is hard to get less popular than 18 percent. Those are tough numbers to do worse than. The reason Republicans are racing this bill through the process is because they know how deeply unpopular it is because they know it is a scam. They know it is essentially just taking healthcare from Americans and forcing them to pay more in order to finance a tax cut for the rich.  What is happening today in the House is they are blowing up their rules in order to push a bill through that no one will have looked at. It is possible that they are going to file a gigantic reform to the entire American healthcare system and then call a vote on it within hours. Come on.  In 2009 and 2010, Republicans were blistering critics of Democrats, who they said were forcing the Affordable Care Act through the process too quickly. But in 2009 and 2010, the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health reform bill over the period of an entire year. House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments, and accepted 121 amendments.  This bill was introduced 2 weeks ago. The first time the American public ever looked at it was 2 weeks ago, and the House is rushing it through today. Two weeks. Fourteen days. Twenty days. Not a year. Not 79 hearings. Not 100 hours of hearings. And we are talking about bringing it up before the Senate for a vote next week, with 20 hours of debate on a reordering of one-sixth of the American economy.  It is really extraordinary how this bill is getting jammed through the process because Republicans know that every day it hangs out there, more people figure out what it is--a massive transfer of wealth from regular, ordinary Americans, through less care and higher costs, to the very rich and also insurance companies and drug companies, which get a big tax cut.  On today's modification of the bill, the talk today is that in order to make the bill a little bit meaner and a little bit crueler, the House is going to remove from the underlying law the requirement that insurance companies cover a basic set of what are called essential benefits. This change is being demanded by the very, very conservative wing of the House Republican conference. They call themselves the Freedom This is a group of sort of the most radical Members in the House of They are demanding that these essential healthcare benefits be stripped out of the law in order to get their votes.  Let's talk about what these essential healthcare benefits are. Basically the law now says that if you are offering an insurance plan and you want to call it health insurance, then you have to actually offer to cover healthcare. So the essential healthcare benefits--what every plan today has to offer in order to be able to call itself insurance in this country--are ambulatory patient care, which means outpatient care, emergency care, hospitalizations; pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse care; prescription drugs; rehabilitation if you get injured; lab services; tests; chronic disease management--management for diabetes or heart and liver conditions; and pediatric services, services for kids. That is it. Those are the essential healthcare benefits.  Frankly, if you are buying a health insurance plan, wouldn't you expect that it would cover your emergency care if you were to go to an emergency room? If you are buying healthcare in this country, what good is it if it doesn't cover a hospitalization when you get very sick? If you are buying an insurance plan in this country, don't you think it is going to cover your kids when they need basic pediatric services?[[Page S1961]]  So what is happening now is something different from healthcare reform in the House of What is happening now is a radical rethink of what healthcare insurance is. If all of a sudden health insurers don't need to cover the cost of your hospitalizations, don't need to cover mental illness at all, don't need to cover addiction coverage at all, then is it really insurance any longer? If it is not covering that list of things, what is it covering?  CBO has an answer for this. CBO says that if there is an insurance plan that doesn't cover this list of benefits, they won't count it as insurance. So when they are giving you the numbers of people who will have insurance or not have insurance after this bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says: We don't really count it as insurance if it doesn't cover basic stuff, such as hospitalizations, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and pediatric services.  So what is happening now in the House of Representatives is really a radical rethink of healthcare insurance. Under the law they are contemplating passing, healthcare insurance wouldn't need to cover anything. You could buy an insurance plan, pay your premium, and then be told that it doesn't cover your kid when he gets diagnosed with schizophrenia, that it doesn't cover your daughter when she gets in an accident and has to go to the emergency room, that it doesn't cover your spouse when they get really sick and are hospitalized for 3 days. What kind of coverage would that be any longer if it didn't cover that list of things?  Let's be honest. This would be a massive transfer of cost to individuals. The 1 prong of TrumpCare is higher costs. If insurance companies don't need to cover any of these things anymore but you still have to buy them, then it is just a massive shift of costs to individuals because, remember, TrumpCare penalizes you if you don't buy insurance.  The Affordable Care Act did the same thing, admittedly. The Affordable Care Act said: If you don't buy insurance, you are going to pay a penalty. But that is why the Affordable Care Act said that insurance has to really be insurance. It has to cover stuff because if we are going to require you to buy it or we are going to penalize you if you don't buy it, then insurance should really be insurance.  Well, TrumpCare penalizes you if you don't buy insurance. You would pay a massive penalty. For a lot of people, the penalty could be $5,000 if they don't buy insurance. But now the change they are considering in the House of Representatives means the insurance product you will be forced to buy won't cover diddly.  By the way, when your insurance company doesn't cover it and you have to pick up the cost, it is going to cost you way more money. Everybody has probably seen a bill from a hospital. Let's say you had to go in and get a colonoscopy. You get your bill, and you always sort of scratch your head because you see two numbers--you see the number the hospital bills and then you see the number your insurance company pays. Often, the number the insurance company pays is like one-third of what that hospital billed. Why is that? It is because the insurance company is negotiating with the hospital on behalf of thousands of patients, so they get that price way, way down. The insurance company only pays a fraction of the cost that is billed. If you don't have insurance coverage for it, if all of a sudden it is not a benefit in your plan because the American Health Care Act told insurance companies they didn't have to cover a hospitalization, then you will pay that higher price. You don't get the insurance company discount. You will pay that higher number. That is going to bankrupt people.  The families in my State, when their child gets hooked on heroin, they are going to find a way to pay for that care so that their child doesn't become another statistic, another one of the 900 who died in my State last year from overdoses. They are going to do everything possible to get that child care for that addiction. They will mortgage their house, they will sell their house, they will drain their savings account, they will sell off every possession they have to make sure their child does not die from an overdose and so that child gets the care they need. If their insurance company won't cover it, then they will do everything necessary to cover it, and you will have a rapid increase in the number of people whose lives are ruined, who go bankrupt because of their medical costs--something that doesn't happen right now because the Affordable Care Act gives you real subsidies to afford care. It gives you real help to be able to buy insurance, and it requires that insurance companies actually provide you with insurance.  This is an extraordinary thing that is happening in the U.House of Representatives right now. Nobody likes this bill. Healthcare experts think it is a joke. The American public has roundly rejected it. It is getting meaner and crueler every day in order to round up the votes necessary to get it passed. Why? Because this bill is not about solving any problem in the healthcare system. It doesn't solve a single problem. Again, except for this narrow group of younger, healthier, affluent people whose premiums will be a little bit less, everybody else is worse off. It only solves one problem, a political problem--the promise that the Republicans made to repeal the Affordable Care But they didn't spend any time thinking about how to actually do it. So they are stuck now with an awful bill that nobody likes, that doesn't solve a single problem, and that is getting meaner and meaner every single day.  It was bad enough, and now this bill is frankly getting into some really radical territory--talking about totally rethinking insurance and letting insurance companies offer you a product that covers nothing and then it requires you to buy it. Think about that. We are going to require you to buy insurance, but the insurance isn't going to cover anything. TrumpCare, the American Health Care Act--whatever you want to call it--has three prongs: higher costs, less care, and tax cuts for the rich.  We will have an opportunity here in the Senate to get this right. As to the House of Representatives, I don't know if they are going to pass this. I don't know if it is going to fall apart. But we will have a chance to get this right. Republicans and Democrats coming together, we can admit together that there are still a lot of things that are wrong in our healthcare system.  In the Affordable Care Act, there are some good parts of it, but other parts need improvement. We can come together and decide to tackle this problem--the high drug costs, whatever it may be--together and reject this partisan, rushed approach in the House of It does nothing except give us higher costs and less care in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.21, the Midnight Rules Relief  Thisirresponsible legislation would enable Congress to wipe out hundreds, or even thousands, of regulations enacted during the finalyear of the President's term in office, in one fell swoop, with little examination, no deliberation, and little regard to theirimpact on public health or safety.  Members from both sides of the aisle have expressed concern in recent years over rulesadopted during a Presidential transition period--typically, the last 60 to 90 days of the President's term. But this legislationdiffers greatly from previous legislation that I and others have introduced in the past to deal with this problem.  Forexample, the Midnight Rule Act, which I introduced in the 110th and 111th Congresses, would have merely delayed theimplementation of rules submitted to Congress within the final 90 days of a President's term, with appropriate exceptions forimminent threat to health and safety, enforcement of criminal laws, implementation of an international trade agreement, andnational security.  This proposal was a response to concerns with last-minute rulemaking under the George Bushadministration, which was roundly criticized at the time for allowing insufficient time for public comment, ignoring publiccomments, and otherwise departing from accepted rulemaking practices.  My bill would have given an incoming President 90 daysto determine if any rules issued should not go forward. This measure would have allowed legitimate regulatory reform to proceedon schedule while putting the power to review and overturn controversial new rules into the hands of the newly electedadministration.  The legislation before us today, however, goes much further and creates a process to simply erase the lastmonths of an outgoing administration's regulatory agenda.  Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can overturn aregulation issued by the executive branch through a disapproval resolution that must be signed by the This bill wouldallow Congress to package these disapproval resolutions together and eliminate dozens, hundreds, or even thousands, ofregulations all at once, with little debate over the merits of any individual rule.  Under the CRA, agencies would beprevented from proposing similar rules ever again, absent explicit congressional authorization. You would have a rule terminatedwith no debate because it is one of a thousand rules done away with in one resolution. You can't even look at it again.  TheRepublican majority has waged an all-out assault on the regulatory process, trying to add hurdle after hurdle on the ability toissue regulations that protect public health and safety. Not content to grind the gears of rulemaking to a halt, they now wantto eliminate wholesale those regulations that have gone through the exhaustive rulemaking process--aprocess that often takes many years to complete.  Even more concerning, this bill would apply to rules issued in the last 60legislative days of a President's[[Page H77]]term. Not calendar days, but legislative days.

13459,topic-id,2553,"Mr.President, sovereign nations across the globe are brought together by different unifying forces. It can be a shared heritage, language, religion, or outside historical forces that led to borders drawn decades or centuries ago.  As a nation, we are unique. We are diverse in every sense of the word, but even in these polarizing times, we are overwhelmingly unified. We are unified by our belief in democracy, free enterprise, and economic opportunity. We are all entrusted in nurturing the ideas enshrined in our Constitution--the idea that our system of democratic government enables us to work toward a more perfect union. At a time when the promise of democracy is receding for far too many around the world, we must do everything we can to uphold our country's free and fair elections, the foundation of our democracy.  Our elections should serve as a global benchmark for the peaceful transition of power. As President Reagan said, we must be ``the shining city upon the hill,'' and we must lead by example. Our elections require a strong and steady commitment from our newly naturalized citizens; from families whose families fought in the Revolutionary War; from volunteers who cover 16-hour shifts to keep polling locations open; from country, city, and township clerks.  The preservation of free and fair elections requires a strong commitment from our highest elected official in the land. As Americans, we look to the President of the United States to safeguard our democracy from foreign adversaries.  When we are presented with clear and mounting evidence that the Russian Government, at the personal discretion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, orchestrated a campaign to undermine this most fundamental institution and interfere in our election, we should expect nothing less than a clear and forceful response from the White House that this kind of behavior is simply unacceptable. Unfortunately, what we have seen from President Trump and the White House so far amounts to little more than confusion, evasion, and a whole lot of smoke.  President Trump has spoken time and again about wanting to build closer ties with On the campaign trail, he frequently fawned over Putin's strength as a leader. In 2013, he asked his Twitter followers, ``Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow--if so, will he become my new best friend?''  While I don't believe that Putin attended the pageant, the nature of the Putin-Trump relationship remains an open question. It confuses me and quite frankly alarms me that President Trump speaks so fondly of a man who brutally cracks down on his political opponents and journalists at home while stirring up conflict and aggressions abroad.  Make no mistake, Vladimir Putin is no friend of the United States or of the American people. Our Nation's intelligence agencies agree with high confidence that his government orchestrated a campaign to undermine the integrity of our recent election, and Putin has sought at every turn to destabilize the international order that has kept the American people and our allies secure for decades.  Russia's interference in our election was not an isolated incident. It is part of a broader effort to undermine the NATO alliance and weaken western democracies. I heard from our French and German allies at the Munich Security Conference last month about their concerns that Russia will continue to engage in disinformation campaigns in European elections. As we aspire to be the free-market driven, democratic ``city upon a hill,'' Putin's government works to sow chaos globally in an effort to further consolidate power in his nationalist, self-enriching regime.  These attempts to destabilize Russia's neighbors and rivals are not limited to cyber space and computer code. These provocations involve military aircraft, ships, nuclear capable missiles, heavy artillery, drones, and efforts to redraw international borders.  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe that the highest duty of Congress is to keep Americans safe. Russia's dangerous and unprofessional military provocations not only place American servicemembers and NATO allies at risk, they endanger civilian lives and raise the specter of escalating regional conflict.  Just last month, Russian aircraft flew within a few hundred feet of the USS Porter in international waters in a dangerous mock attack--an action the ship's captain called out as ``unsafe and unprofessional.''  Last summer, while on a congressional delegation to meet with NATO allies, I heard directly from Estonian leaders about Russia's blatant disregard for their sovereignty. Russian forces kidnapped a border guard in Estonian territory and sentenced him behind closed doors to 15 years in prison, in what a top European Union official called ``a clear violation of international law.''  We have seen the Russians fly reconnaissance and fighter jets in international airspace, with their transponders switched off in order to avoid detection--at one point, nearly colliding in midair with a passenger airplane. NATO has been forced to scramble jets almost 800 times--let me repeat[[Page S1966]]that: 800 times--in 2016 alone, just to respond to Russia's encroachments on NATO airspace.  As the President speaks glowingly about Putin, Mr.Putin returns the favor by deploying a dangerous new cruise missile, in clear violation of the Reagan-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Simultaneously, a Russian spy ship has been spotted lurking off the U.coast, trying to gather intelligence information near the Navy's primary east coast submarine base.  We are also seeing Russia undertake the largest military buildup in the Arctic since the end of the Cold War and at a pace faster than we ever, ever saw during the Soviet era.  Russia is reopening defunct military outposts and building new ones all across the polar region. There are 13 new Russian airfields that are scheduled to open by the end of this year. The Russian military recently staged an exercise in the Arctic region with well over 12,000 troops.  As the Russians build up their forces in the Arctic, the United States is falling behind. Our principal maritime force in the Arctic is the U.Coast Guard, but they have only one heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star, that is capable of keeping Arctic shipping lanes open or conducting search and rescue missions year-round. A new icebreaker to replace the Polar Star is still a few years away.  In contrast, the Russians have over 40 icebreakers in their fleet, many of them nuclear, with plans for three new icebreakers underway. At a time when we should be investing in our Arctic capabilities, the Trump administration has been considering deep cuts to the Coast Guard's budget.  Russia's expansionist activities and military probing are not occurring in a vacuum. The numerous threats and provocations that I have outlined occur as Russia continues to wage war in eastern Ukraine in the wake of their illegal annexation of Crimea, destabilizing the opportunity for the Ukrainian people to chart their own political and economic destiny. There are 10,000 people who have lost their lives in this conflict as a direct result of Russian aggression.  Last year, as I traveled with my Senate colleagues to Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine, I learned firsthand about the efforts in these countries to strengthen their civil institutions and root out corruption, build lasting partnerships, and stand up to Russian provocations. While they are doing their part, they continue to look to the United States for global leadership.  This year, U.troops deployed to Eastern Europe to demonstrate our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies, where they were welcomed with open arms. We are working with our partners in Iceland to enhance their capabilities to detect and respond to a recent increase in Russian submarine patrols.  I am also proud to stand with the airmen of the 127th Wing of the Michigan Air National Guard, who deployed from my State to build on their long record of successful cooperation with our partners in  When the Kremlin is threatening our allies, buzzing our Navy warships, and meddling in foreign elections, now is not the time to call into question the commitment or the resolve of the United States of  Vladimir Putin's world view is shaped by his time in the KGB during the Cold He is committed to projecting Russian strength, both at home and abroad, through intimidation and aggression. Strength is what he respects. If Putin's provocations are not met with a strong response, they will continue and likely escalate, putting American interests and the American people at risk.  Top officials in the Trump administration have been dispatched to crisscross Europe and reassure the world of our commitments to global security. I joined Vice President Pence and Secretary Mattis in Germany last month for the annual Munich Security  They spoke of America's commitment to NATO and the international order, which was built from the ashes of World War II, in an apparent attempt to reassure our nervous allies, but our allies are not trying to understand the aims of the Mattis administration or the Pence administration. They are trying to determine if President Trump will stand behind NATO and the institutions that have served as a counterweight to Russian aggression for decades.  The American people are also watching the White House, and they deserve to know that those who serve at the highest levels of government will always have America's best interests at heart. But every week we are faced with mounting evidence that the Trump administration and the Trump campaign have ties to Russia and are working to cover up their interactions with Russian officials.  Earlier this week, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Comey announced that the FBI was ``investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian Government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.'' This bears repeating. The FBI Director has confirmed that there is an active investigation into coordination between a Presidential campaign and a foreign adversary. This is just the latest development in a long string of disturbing revelations about President Trump's associates.  Ousted campaign chairman Paul Manafort has a deep web of business and political connections to Russian interests. Other campaign advisers have backed off previous claims that they never spoke with Russian officials. In fact, the coverup of these interactions has already resulted in the first resignation from the Trump administration.  Not long after President Obama imposed sanctions on the Russian officials and military intelligence agencies that were responsible for interfering in our election, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had a secret, off-the-record discussion with Russian Ambassador Kislyak, in which he discussed lifting these sanctions under the incoming Trump administration.  Top officials at the Justice Department clearly warned the White House that Mr.Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail. He resigned only after it became clear that he misled the public and the Vice President about the substance of these off-the-record conversations.  But it doesn't just end there.  The Attorney General, at best, misled the Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings about his record of contact with Russian officials. He testified under oath that he ``did not have communications with the Russians'' during the campaign. When it became clear that he had actually met with the Russian Ambassador at least twice last year, including in a one-on-one meeting in the final weeks of the campaign, he was forced to recuse himself from the Justice Department's criminal investigation into this very, very serious issue.  It has been my experience that, when people are caught covering up their meetings and contacts with someone, they usually have something to hide. If you have nothing to hide, there is no reason for a coverup.  The serious national security implications of the Trump administration's potential ties with Russia cannot be overstated. This is a time when we need to make clear that Russian aggression will not stand. Instead, the President has attempted to distract the public through unsubstantiated allegations about the wiretapping of Trump Tower--an allegation that has been refuted by FBI Director Comey and others. President Trump continues to double down by calling into question the motives of those who want assurances about integrity in our elections.  Let me be clear. This is not about partisan politics. When there is so much smoke, there is probably some fire somewhere. If another country is infiltrating our government and political institutions or if Vladimir Putin has favors to cash in from officials at the highest levels of government, that is a serious problem.  Russia has endangered our servicemembers, threatened our allies, illegally annexed Crimea, engaged in war crimes in their bombing of Aleppo, and actively worked to undermine our democracy. These revelations are only adding more smoke to the Russia fire, and it is clear we need a special prosecutor to investigate.[[Page S1967]]  The American people expect this investigation to be free from any political interference or influence or bias. We need someone to cut through the smoke and clear the air. An independent special prosecutor should be appointed to examine Russia's campaign to interfere in our election as well as any association or coordination between the Trump campaign and  I also believe that the time has come to create an independent, nonpartisan commission to fully investigate Russian interference. Earlier today, I cosponsored legislation introduced by Senator Cardin that would create such a commission and provide it with the necessary subpoena power to get the answers that the American people clearly deserve.  This is not about Democrats or Republicans or about relitigating the 2016 election. This is about our national security. This commission, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, would provide a comprehensive report on what occurred last year and make recommendations as to how we can best defend the integrity of future elections.  This is about how we move forward together. This is about how we maintain the independence of our government from foreign influence and instill faith in Americans that the White House is truly working for them.  This is about moving past months of coverups and finally extinguishing this smoldering Russian fire or proving that all of this smoke is, truly, just a series of misunderstandings.  This issue shakes the foundations of our democracy, but our Union has survived harder challenges than this.  At a time when the public's trust in government is called into question, we must do everything we can to restore faith in the integrity and the impartiality of our institutions.  Just as we, as Americans, are unified in our faith in democracy and economic opportunity, we are unified in our belief in the rule of law. Just as we must show strength abroad through our military and our alliances, we must show strength at home by rooting out corruption and protecting our democratic process.  All of us--Democrats and Republicans, Congress and the White House, our diplomats and our military--must send a clear, unified message to authoritarian leaders in Moscow and everywhere else that threats levied against the United States will never be tolerated and that there will be a price to pay for making them.  The American people expect us to keep them safe while strengthening our Republic against enemies, both foreign and domestic. It is our duty to prove that we are up to the job.  I yield the floor.

13232,topic-id,876,"Mr.Speaker, if you would have asked me when I first got elected to Congress, would I ever expect to be in a position, months after a Presidential election, about whether or not the integrity of that election was at stake, I would have said ``of course not.''  Our democracy's strength is that any adult has an equal say in it through their vote; that the wealthiest or the poorest, the youngest or the oldest adult, regardless of their gender, race,[[Page H1131]]religion, or sexual orientation, we all have an equal say in our democracy via our vote; which is why the vote is so important. It is the great equalizer and it gives us confidence in our government, that whoever the people select to be President should be the force of the majority.  But the concern I am speaking about today is the concern that somehow the election this past November might have been interfered with by another government.  Now, I know we have all heard about the intelligence community's classified report regarding Russian hacking and interference in our elections. I have read it and so have many of my colleagues. And, allegedly, President Trump has read the document as well.  My concern is that we seem to have different interpretations of a document that is very clear about unprecedented outside interference. For those of us who have read it, shock. Shock that another country would be so cavalier in their approach to interfere with an election, to manipulate the truth, to go farther than we have ever seen in trying to get the outcome they wanted and ultimately got.  There is no secret that President Trump has an unnerving affection for Russian President Vladimir Trump has called Putin ``very smart.'' He claimed Putin was a better leader than Barack And Trump even defended Putin in a recent interview with a FOX News talk show host.  The connections to Russia and his Cabinet are equally unnerving. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had numerous business dealings with Russia, and was even recognized by Putin with the Order of Friendship in 2013.  But it doesn't stop there. Just last week, U.investigators confirmed that parts of the 35-page intelligence dossier, compiled by a former British spy, were accurate. The dossier contained still unconfirmed details of an all-too-cozy relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Trump  Just yesterday, President Trump's own National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned after being busted for having potentially illegal conversations with the Russian Government regarding lifting sanctions on the country prior to President Trump taking office; conversations he had previously misled to the FBI and the Vice  Who else knew about Flynn, and when did they know about it?  Now, I don't bring this up as an effort to get back into a Cold War with Russia, as some seem to condone. I am disgusted by the Russian Government's scapegoating of the LGBT community and their authoritarian approach to civic affairs. I think getting back into a Cold War would be a terrible idea, and there are some areas around the globe where we could welcome cooperation to solve humanitarian crises.  My concern lies in that the Russian Government did something, hacking and interfering in our elections with the intent of electing their choice for President, Donald That must be addressed through sanctions and safeguards to make sure it never happens again.  If anyone in the executive branch is suggesting lifting any sanctions after what just happened, there needs to be a public dialogue about why, because if they read the same report that I did, there is no way that would be the appropriate response.  But given President Trump's unwillingness to accept the reality of the Russian interference in our election, given the closeness of several leading members of the President's Cabinet to Russia, and given the recent resignation of our National Security Adviser over his dealings with Russia, I feel it is imperative that the American people get all the facts.  Should we be lifting sanctions against a country our intelligence community tells us intentionally, and in multiple ways, tried to interfere with our elections and, ultimately, get the person they wanted elected? Or should we be doing even more to guarantee the sovereignty of our country and the integrity of our elections in every possible way?  Currently, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are investigating Russian interference with our elections, and I applaud them for taking the issue so seriously. Personally, I would love to see an outside, nonpartisan, independent review as well.  However, we need to take this right to the people. The classified report about election interference by the Russians could, in my opinion, with appropriate protections, be declassified so that the American people could see it for themselves.  Mr.President, I request you ask for that report to be fully declassified. If your administration's assertions are correct, let the American people see it. Let the truth come out.  But my guess is, when they see the totality of the report, there will be a lot of explaining for this administration to do, both about our response to Russia and how we protect our elections in the future.  It is really that simple. Let the people decide. Declassify the report.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1130-2.txt,2171,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,14.0,March

13456,topic-id,2164,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the deep and growing concerns about Russia's interference in the United States' 2016 Presidential election and the implications of Russia's broader malign activities for our national security.  On Monday, we learned from FBI Director Comey that there is an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election and whether associates of then-candidate and now-President Donald Trump were communicating with It is absolutely essential that Congress and the American people get clear and comprehensive answers on, first, what happened; second, what are Russia's strategic goals and intentions for further interference in democratic processes here and in Europe; and third, what we need to do to counter this threat going forward. That is why I have repeatedly called for an independent, transparent, special counsel to investigate the legal aspects of Russian efforts to influence our election and a bipartisan select committee within the Senate to look at all aspects of Russia's destabilizing activities here and around the world.  I am concerned that the politicization of the issue of Russia's[[Page S1962]]interference in our elections and its hostile actions against Western institutions and values is diverting our attention from what otherwise should be recognized as a clear and potent threat to America's security. We need to focus on what is critical: Russia is attacking American democracy as part of an even broader assault on our cornerstone NATO alliance and the post-Cold War international order.  The threat posed by Russia's actions is not merely ``fake news,'' as serious as that phenomenon may be, but a very real, very strategic threat to U.interests. Russia is testing America and the transatlantic community across multiple fronts.  Today, I will highlight just how broad and fundamental this threat from Russia really is.  What should be clear to everyone is that last year Russia engaged in a systematic and strategic effort to influence the U.Presidential election. While we do not know all the details of Russia's involvement, we know that in January the U.intelligence community--including the CIA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or the ODNI--issued its assessment that Russia engaged in bold and unprecedented efforts to influence and undermine trust in the U.Presidential election.  Among the January intelligence report's findings were the following: first, that President Putin, in their words, ``ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential election.''  The intelligence community also found that ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''  The report further found that Russia's influence campaign was multifaceted and included covert intelligence operations such as cyber espionage against U.political organizations like the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National It combined the release of hacked information with overt propaganda efforts through Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media actors, or, as they are referred to, trolls.  Another key finding was that Russia's influence efforts in the 2016 U.Presidential election reflect--in the words of the intelligence community--``a significant escalation'' compared to previous information operations.  The intelligence community also warned that these Russian activities, including ``cyber-enabled disclosure operations'' likely represent a ``New Normal'' in Russian conduct toward the United States and our allies and partners.  The intelligence community further assessed that Russia will use the lessons learned from the 2016 U.Presidential election to influence future elections in the United States and overseas. We do not have to look very far for evidence supporting this conclusion.  Russia is alleged to have targeted an April 2016 referendum in the Netherlands on a partnership agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly rejected by Dutch voters. This year, Russia is openly intervening in France's Presidential election to be held in For example, Russia has loaned tens of millions of dollars to the far-right National Front Party in France, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, has defended Russia's annexation of Crimea and criticized international sanctions against  Germany, which holds parliamentary elections in September, has also been targeted by Russian hackers and trolls--straight out of the Kremlin playbook we saw used here last year. Russia is attempting to steadily erode the integrity and western orientation of multiple Eastern European countries through a variety of state and state-controlled or state-influenced activities. These coordinated and focused Russian operations threaten to undermine the European cohesion which underpins the post-Cold War international order. This pattern of Russian interference will only intensify with time if it goes unchallenged.  Russia's malign activities also threaten our core security relationships with our transatlantic allies and partners. The NATO alliance has been the bedrock of our security relationship with our European allies. Since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, countries in Central and Eastern Europe have aspired to integrate more closely with the West, whether militarily through NATO membership or economically within the European Union, or both. But President Putin rejects the post-Cold War international order and seeks to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence over his immediate neighbors by weakening democracy, collective security, and economic cooperation across the region.  In pursuit of this strategic goal, Putin has demonstrated a willingness to use all tools at his disposal, including cyber hacking, disinformation, propaganda, economic leverage, corruption, and even military force, to violate the sovereignty of Russia's neighbors and undermine support for their further integration into  Since 2008, in neighboring Georgia, Russia has occupied two regions and recognized their independence, which the international community widely condemns as a violation of Georgia's territorial integrity. Georgia's aspirations since the 2008 Bucharest Summit to join the NATO Alliance have been on hold.  In Ukraine, Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its continuing support to Russian-led separatists in eastern Ukraine are part of Putin's strategy of destabilizing the Kyiv government and blocking Ukraine's further integration westward. Putin has repeatedly used influence operations to hide the presence of ``little green men'' on Ukrainian soil, to spread disinformation about Ukrainian political leaders, and to influence financially corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs to support Putin is also using propaganda and other activities to try to break western unity in support of the United States and EU sanctions intended to pressure Russia to comply with its commitments under the Minsk agreements for ending the conflict in It is critically important to maintain, and potentially strengthen, these sanctions to change Russia's aggressive behavior and get to a peaceful political settlement to end the fighting in  In Montenegro, it appears that Russia has added political assassination as a potential weapon to block an Eastern European country from pursuing membership in Last month, the British press reported that ``Russian nationalists'' under the direction of Russian intelligence officials plotted to assassinate then-Prime Minister Djukanovic during Montenegro's elections in According to these reports, Montenegrin authorities foiled the assassination attempt just hours before the plot was to be carried out. This attempted coup d'etat represents a new and dangerous level of interference by Russia to discourage Montenegro and others from further integrating with the  As some of my colleagues have read in the February 14th New York Times article, Russia has fielded a missile system that violates the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, Treaty--a ground-launched intermediate-range nuclear missile that threatens all of The INF Treaty was signed by President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. This landmark treaty dramatically reduced Cold War nuclear tensions by eliminating an entire class of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles that could have struck Moscow or Berlin in less than 10 minutes.  Now Russia has moved nuclear-capable, short-range, ground-launched Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave between Poland and The Iskander missile's range threatens German borders--something not seen since the 1980s. The Iskander deployment runs counter to a detente that has been in place since 1989, when President Bush reduced U.conventional forces in Europe--and Russia did the same--in order to relieve destabilizing tension in the region and lessen the risk of escalation or miscalculation. Furthermore, Russian aggression goes beyond the violations of the INF Treaty and the Iskander missile.  During the 2014 invasion of Crimea, Russia practiced snap nuclear exercises to test the readiness of its Armed Forces to send a signal that there was[[Page S1963]]a nuclear backstop to the invasion. More disturbingly, by invading Ukraine, Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum, a multilateral commitment in which Ukraine and three other former Soviet states pledged to transfer to Russia the nuclear weapons they retained after the collapse of the Soviet Union in return for Russian recognition of their sovereignty.  Besides unilaterally reneging on its Budapest commitments, in 2014 Russia has pulled out of the DOD and DOE--Department of Defense and Department of Energy--Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs, which secured nuclear materials at storage sites and national borders. Russia has some of the largest stockpiles of nuclear materials in the world that are vulnerable to insider threats. In 2016, Russia suspended its participation in the agreement with the United States to convert 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium for use as fuel for reactors.  Since the very beginning of the Cold War, nonproliferation and arms control agreements between Russia and the United States have always received a high priority from both countries, regardless of how relations in other areas went up or down. Russia's recent actions call into question whether this can continue.  Russian actions in Syria pose a further challenge to stability in the Middle East and the broader international community. Russia's military operations to prop up the murderous Assad regime belies Moscow's claim that it intervened to fight violent extremists, including ISIS and al-Russia has provided significant political, economic, and military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, even as he has slaughtered tens of thousands of Syrian civilians and used chemical weapons against his own people. Russia has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the U.Security Council on behalf of the Syrian regime in defiance of international standards and U.S.-led peace efforts, and, just last month, Russia vetoed a U.Security Council resolution seeking to punish Syria for using chemical weapons.  For all of these reasons, we must recognize that Russia's alarming interference in our election is only one aspect of a much broader and dangerous threat to our core national security interests. Russia's malign behavior needs to be investigated fully and in a manner that is free of political considerations. We need answers to key questions, including:  What are Russia's overall strategic security goals, and how do Russian influence activities in Europe and the United States advance those goals?  What are the tools of Russia's influence? How has Russia used, or continues to use, those tools in influencing campaigns in Europe? How do Russian activities in Europe compare to what was evident in the U.Presidential elections last year?  How has Russia used influence activities in concert with other unconventional warfare tactics and operational activities--for example, to support proxy forces in Ukraine and elsewhere?  What is the threat these Russian influence activities pose to U.democratic institutions? To NATO? To the European Union? To the post-Cold War liberal order and value system?  What are the weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the United States and European countries that Russia is successfully exploiting and magnifying?  Finally, how can the U.Government counter and deter Russia's influence activities, and what capabilities, structures, and other resources are needed for these purposes?  An investigation of these questions would best be conducted by an independent, transparent, outside body appointed in a bipartisan manner. However, if Congress cannot reach consensus to make that happen, then, as a ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I intend to work with the chairman to undertake the necessary effort within the committee and across the I believe we can work in a bipartisan fashion on this critical threat to our national security. I look forward to shedding light on this issue and examining what we need to do as a country to defend ourselves against and deter Russian malign influence.  As a final point, we are focused, of course, on what happened in 2016--and it is a topic of daily discussions and newspaper articles--but one of the most sobering factors is that we have an election in process right now for 2018. If it demonstrates the same interference, Russia could have an effect on that election. Indeed, there are indications that they are actually probing State election systems--the names of voters, how the States calculate and vote. Nothing has been established that would suggest they attempted to influence that activity, but the simple probing suggests that we have much to do to protect ourselves going forward--indeed, as much as looking back and finding out what went on in the 2016 election.  For these reasons, and many more, we have to work together, as I suggested and encouraged, in a bipartisan way to get at the answers--not just to look backward but to protect ourselves going forward.

Elizabeth understood the need to move health care dollars into the front end of the system, where they could be used more efficiently to prevent illness, through patient care management, case management and nutrition, and by keeping people out of expensive hospital settings. She also recognized the critical need for all-inclusive and integrated health care, including dental care and mental health services, in both urban and rural communities served by FQHC's.

We will only move our healthcare policy forward by working together to[[Page H2006]]build on the very real successes of ACA and fix the actual problems with the law. But this legislation as proposed does none of that and, in fact, takes us in the opposite direction.

Seniors would be charged much more than what others pay for health care, and the 3.2 million Illinoisans who depend on Medicaid will face cuts to their coverage.  Mr.Speaker, this House is recklessly and unnecessarily rushing to a vote before we have basic answers. Most importantly, we need to know from the Congressional Budget Office how many people this bill will and will not cover and how much it will cost.  We need to set aside the politics and work in a bipartisan way to give all Americans quality, affordable health care.

13315,topic-id,669,"Madam President, I rise today to speak on a matter of great importance to the foreign policy of thiscountry: our relationship with Russia and the efficacy of international sanctions to achieve our international security goals.  The reports of the past 24 hours are extremely troubling. But one thing we now all agree on is that Russia is behind thehacking of our election, as even the President-elect has now just said. This makes it even more important that we not only keepthe existing sanctions in place but that we institute a new, tough sanctions regime in response so Russia can't get away withwhat they did and other countries will know as well that they will suffer penalty if they try to interfere with our elections.  Unfortunately, this morning's Cabinet hearing on Mr.Tillerson's nomination is a very troubling sign of things to come. Inone breath, Mr.Tillerson said that the invasion of Crimea is a violation of international law, and in the next, amazinglyenough, he declined to commit to maintaining the existing sanctions regime against He said he wants to get classifiedbriefings first and then consult with the President-elect. But I remind the[[Page S224]]country, as my friend the Senator fromFlorida, Mr.Rubio, from across the aisle, did, that these sanctions are a result of past crimes.  We don't need aclassified briefing to know what Russia has done in the past. To duck the question and to refuse to commit to continuing thesesanctions is tantamount to sweeping Russia's flouting of international laws under the rug. It sort of says: Go ahead, interferein our elections again; nothing will happen to you. It says the same to China and Iran or to any other country that might try tohack.  Secretary Nominee Tillerson has also not committed to new sanctions. Just yesterday, abipartisan group of Senators, including the Senators from South Carolina, Maryland, Florida, California, Nebraska, introduced atough, new sanctions-on-Russia bill for their interference in our elections. I support this effort. I believe the Senate shouldact soon upon it. I am very concerned that thus far the President-elect, Mr.Tillerson, and Senator Sessions have notendorsed these tough new sanctions.  The Senator from Florida--not from my party--also pressed Mr.Tillerson on a series of warcrimes committed by the Assad regime and the Russian military in These crimes have been reported in the press anddetailed extensively by people on the ground and discussed at length by my friend, the Republican Senator from Arizona, Mr.Mr.Tillerson will not even acknowledge these violations of human rights and war crimes.  Finally, I am veryconcerned that despite the fact that we have registered lobbying disclosures from ExxonMobil itself, documenting theirinvolvement in lobbying against Iran sanctions, Mr.Tillerson said this morning that Exxon did not lobby on sanctions, to hisknowledge.  This comes on top of recent reports that Exxon avoided Iran's sanctions by dealing with Iran and other statesponsors of terrorism through a European subsidiary. This, too, is very concerning. It raises real questions as to whether thePresident-elect and his Cabinet are prepared to stand up to Putin, stand up to Iran, and represent the interests of the Americanpeople and defend our democratic allies around the world.  My friends on the other side of the aisle have nearly universallycriticized this President, Mr.Obama, for his policy on Syria and for not being tough enough on Vladimir Republicans havealways called themselves the party of I don't need to remind any of them of his famous speech in West Now, itseems, this fundamental tenet of Republican foreign policy, and indeed our national policy for the last few decades, is erodingbefore our very eyes. Now, it seems, the President-elect and his Cabinet may never address the international security policychallenges posed by Russia and state sponsors of terrorism like Iran and If Mr.Tillerson cannot even say that he willsupport the existing sanctions, what kind of Secretary of State will he be?

Mr.Speaker, tonight I am given this time as a result of the majority leader, Mr.He has given me time to talk about an important issue that faces not only our country, but also elected Members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate and the President of the United States, our new President, President  As each of us is aware, the issue of health care is one of the most important issues that has been faced in our Nation for many years. Back in 2009, President Obama began the search that he talked about for what was called an Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act seemed to be a promise to make health care better. It seemed to be a word, in the words of the President, an Affordable Care Act that would help all Americans to receive health care on a fair basis and one that would be sustainable.  The President stood before this body several times and talked about his ideas about health care. It took about a year, maybe a little bit more, for the Democratic Congress to work through this issue. On or about March 21 or 22, 2010, a bill popped out of the United States Senate, came to the House of Representatives, and we handled the matter here up in the Rules Committee, brought it to the floor, passed it with debate, no opposition--no opposition, meaning Republicans were not allowed to present an alternative case, a bill. It was a closed rule. And the Democrats passed it and went to the White House the next day, March 23, 2010, and signed the bill.                              {time}  1930  The American people had grave reservations about that, but what happened is that it took several years in which they were working through this process. We did not know exactly what would happen; but, almost immediately, hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of spending would take place and taxes would take place. What the President did and what the Democrat Party did is they tied health care directly to employers and put mandates on top of employers and mandates on top of individuals with the belief that individuals would be forced into taking what was then ObamaCare--health care--under the Affordable Care  What has happened over the years, including as we stand today, is that only some 12 to 20 million people are on ObamaCare at any one time. That is because the system that was devised and run by the Affordable Care Act is a system that does not work well. It is very expensive. It provides limited benefits. And perhaps worst of all, the promise that it would make health care available and better for poorer people never materialized as they sold it. In fact, healthcare providers are reimbursed 50 percent less than from normal insurance; meaning that, while you may have some bit of coverage, the people who would accept that health care are hard to find.  It is true that many times you could find someone who is a GP--someone who is a family physician, someone who is an internist who might take what is known as ObamaCare--but if he found something that might be wrong or needed to refer that individual, it was very difficult to do. In my hometown of Dallas, Texas, major hospitals do not take what is known as ObamaCare under the Affordable Care Act, and it is because of this problem that it is a false promise for the people who are on it.  Members of Congress are legally required to be on ObamaCare if we accept the health care from our providers, but President Obama did not ask anyone else in government to fall under the same opportunities that we would have as Members of Over the years, it became a festering point--a sore--among not only those who were paying the costs, but also those who were on it saw it as a concrete life preserver, one that did not live up to its billing. Repeatedly, businesses would come to the House of Representatives--to Members of Congress--and say to us: This law is not only not working, it is causing us to make full-time employees become part-time employees because we cannot either pay or do not want to or do not have the ability to follow all of the requirements of the law.  We here in America saw not only dwindling opportunities for employment, but we also saw the skyrocketing cost--from taxes, from behavior that did not help health care. So Republicans, yes, and the American people began talking about some way that we could isolate health care to where we would have our friends who were Democrats want to accept one of these opportunities to fix this broken system. Over the years, Republicans offered some 60 different alternative votes--piece parts, rifle shots--that said we want to fix ObamaCare, the Affordable Care We picked 60 different things about the bill that were either incomplete, that did not live up to the billing, that caused bad behavior, or that simply were tremendously anticompetitive in their nature.  It was a lonely few years.  As the chairman of the House Rules Committee, day after day, we would seek opportunities for our colleagues to come join us to present their ideas, and they not only disagreed with us, but they chastised us. We kept going. We kept offering alternatives to a healthcare system that was not working.  Mr.Speaker, what happened is the American people soon saw, as we came close to another election, that we were going to have to ask the American people to be a part of the solution. We had tried in Washington, D.We had over 60 votes and we had made it a regular part of our discussion. Republicans, each time, had better ideas, better alternatives--ways to take 60 different pieces and trade them out so that we could better this terrible law that was not working.  Then came the election. With the election, one of the most key and cleanest issues that was discussed was not only the repeal of ObamaCare, but the promise that Republicans would replace it also. For the past 4 or 5 years, Republicans have had a talking point that we want to repeal and to replace the healthcare system that was known as  Mr.Speaker, that is why I am here tonight--to talk about Republican ideas that we think are better for health care and ideas that we think will work not only in a marketplace, but that will be able to be used by a vast number of people here in It will not be something that is use it or lose it, as health care many times is. It will be sustainable. Perhaps, more importantly, there will be the ability for families to get what they want and to not have to pay for what they do not need. It passed on March 21 by a vote of 219-212. No Republican supported the Affordable Care Act, but every Republican understands that health care is important to families. It is important that a family takes the responsibility and tries to cover its family.  Tonight, as I speak with you about where we are in health care, I want to include the words that come from Dallas, Texas--my home--of the families whom I have gotten to know and of the families who have communicated with me, because, as their Member of Congress, I am expected not only to listen, but to try and work for their betterment. I am probably no different than hundreds of other Members of Congress who come to Washington every week with a message.  This is from Julie Ross of Dallas, Texas, with her two beautiful children. This is a very high-level conversation in which she says:       Now that my daughter is at home and thriving--who was in      the hospital--we depend upon these protections to provide[[Page H596]]     health care for her complex healthcare needs.  ObamaCare did not meet those needs; but as a Member of Congress, if I am going to talk about repealing, I need to also, forthrightly, talk about replacing what is a bad healthcare law with a better healthcare alternative. Republicans have better ideas to fix health care, and I am going to speak about these.  The first thing I would like to speak about is the reality that about 150 million Americans have an opportunity to receive their health care on a pretax basis. That means that our employers and our employees who work for large companies have a chance to get their health care without paying for it on an after-tax basis. I pay about $13,000 myself out of pocket for my health care. My employer pays essentially what is a 70-30 split, but that entire amount is on a pretax basis. The 1943 employer-sponsored insurance exemption and the 21st Century Cures, which we just passed this last December, allow businesses an opportunity to provide their employees with pretax health insurance. Pretax health insurance means that they are able to deduct the contributions that they make for their employees, and employees are allowed to receive this as a benefit.  However, this, I believe, is part of what we have known for a long time as being an unfair, rigged system. It is a system that says, if you work for one of these larger companies, you will get that tax advantage; but if you do not--if you are self-employed, if you are an entrepreneur, if you are a 941-type employee, meaning perhaps you are a real estate agent who is self-employed or perhaps you work for a small company--then you are not offered this pretax opportunity. It is probably true that you could deduct that amount next As you pay your taxes, you would file if you qualified based upon the amount of money that you spent.  Mr.Speaker, this right here is the disadvantage for about 100 million They do not receive what 150 million other Americans do, and that is to get their health care on a pretax basis. I have worked now for some 2 years with some 500 physicians who are across the country. We have worked on a system that would allow every single American not only to have better health care, but to have an opportunity to participate on a fair basis.  The gentleman from Lubbock, Texas (Mr.Arrington) will participate with me tonight and will speak about how important this is for him.  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH594-3.txt,1548,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,23.0,February
13218,topic-id,4376,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Arrington), one of our brand new freshman from Lubbock, Jodey not only comes from the high plains of Lubbock, a young man who has given great service to the State of Texas, but he also comes as our newest member from the Texas delegation who stands not only with the principles of that district, but with the principle of caring about other people. I thank the gentleman for letting his voice be heard about what will be a bill that will be before the House of Representatives tomorrow.  Mr.Speaker, continuing our discussion about health care and Republican ideas. Back in 2013, some 4.7 million Americans that had their own health care were knocked off that health care because it didn't qualify in the way that President Obama and Democrats wanted to have a comprehensive healthcare plan. So it knocked off 4.7 million Americans, and what it did is it placed America into a circumstance where we began looking for options and alternatives about how we would insure the uninsured.  We were told: Just watch and wait. This Affordable Care Act is going to make sure that it takes every single American and gives them an affordable healthcare plan.  Here is what happened, Mr.We found out that we still have some 30 million people in this country--now in the sixth year of ObamaCare--that do not have coverage. We have learned that about 49 percent of those who are insured work for employers, about 20 percent of the marketplace is Medicaid, about 14 percent is Medicare, but we still have some 9 percent who were uninsured.  We then find out that what happened is that the Federal Government decided that insurance was not working, so we had coops that were invented out of the Affordable Care Seventeen out of the 23 coops have now gone into bankruptcy. They could not provide the services that the Affordable Care Act was just so sure, with government-run programs, would work; and they wiped out almost unilaterally every single insurance plan where they came in. I don't know if it was just because they undercut them, but what they did is provided a false indicator for people.  Well, the Federal Government is here. Barack Obama and Democrats now have a healthcare plan for every single Only a few short years later, they are gone. They are gone from the marketplace after wiping out the insurance that was there.  Perhaps worst of all, as they left, there was a requirement by the Obama administration that somebody had to come and renew insurance, even late in the year, or they would receive a $2,000 penalty because they did not have insurance at the end of the year.  Mr.Speaker, this is what the insured and the uninsured look like. A gentleman from Dallas, Texas, Kennis Ketchum told us: I am being penalized for being an entrepreneur. I am in here, and I want to be in here. I want to be able to go and to allow myself to be in insurance, but I cannot afford it because I do not have the tax advantage.  So Republicans finally have the chance for our ideas that we believe are bigger and better. We have a chance to do, I think, what we have wanted to do for a long time; and that is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but with the promise that we need to make sure that we replace it with something better.  What does this mean?  Well, I will tell you what it means, Mr.What it means is that Republicans are going to understand that a simple plan that can be paid for literally with the existing dollars that are in health care today and authorized by law--some $1.2 trillion that exists in law and authorized today--can be utilized for a healthcare system to take care of each and every I would like to describe that.  First of all, it is important for us to understand that of the uninsured in this country, 74 percent work. That means that people that are no different than me and you, Mr.Speaker, get up and go to work to the best of their ability. It might be that they don't have all the advantages of education that I have. It could be that they have something in their life that might be an impediment. It could be some sort of perhaps what might be a difference or a disability. I understand this. I have a son that has Down syndrome. Alex is not really capable of taking care of himself, so he is not necessarily one of these that would qualify for what we know as the alternative to  There are millions who do need the help, who do want and need insurance and not insurance that is like the Affordable Care Act because we know[[Page H597]]that reimburses at 50 percent less than insurance, some 25 percent less than Medicaid, a plan that limits the number of physicians and healthcare professionals that a person can see.  The American people need something that they can count on. They need something that is better, that provides better reimbursement to where virtually every hospital would take their plan instead of a few, where four times as many doctors would take their plan, their insurance as opposed to them being on These people who want and seek health care need a plan that is worthy of the representation that would be given to them, and that is the Republican idea.  So Republicans have a chance, an opportunity. Just one of the ideas is to allow the healthcare tax benefits to be consistent with those of every American who works for a large company.  You see, there are two ways to look at this. One might be a high standard deduction that an employee or a person would be able to take and buy health insurance and, next April, be able to write that off, so to speak, as a pretax deduction. You know the problem with that and so do Seventy-four percent of the people who are uninsured do not have the money to buy health care. Seventy-four percent of the people who are uninsured might not have enough money to be able to go buy insurance and wait all year long to get back their money next April when they file their taxes.  So one of the ideas that I have--and I shared this plan with Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana--is that what we would like to do is to provide a $2,500 tax credit for adults and a $1,500 tax credit for dependent children that would be advanceable, assignable, and refundable.  What would this mean?  This would mean that this year every single American that did not receive the tax advantage--the tax advantage like I receive and some 150 million Americans receive by getting their health care on a pretax basis--would have an opportunity to go online. They would be able to go online and look at the insurance in their area, and they would be able to receive this benefit, this tax advantage. It would not ever come to them. It would go directly to their insurance program.  They would be able to take, for a family of four, some $8,000. They would be able to use this first $8,000--the exact same tax advantage that Pete Sessions and 150 million other Americans get--January 1st of next year and to assign this $8,000 to their healthcare plan.  They could decide they wanted more, and they would be able to do that on a pretax basis also up to $5,000. They could decide that they would like perhaps to get a plan that would be at their local hospital. That is fine. They could decide that they would like to have what is called a health savings account, an HSA, which, more generally, is an opportunity for them to control their costs. This is very attractive for young people and advantageous for young people because they would be able to control their costs and roll these advantages or savings over year after year after year as opposed to losing what they had saved or, at the beginning of the year, starting back over.  Republicans have an opportunity to make things fair. I think this is what President Trump talked about when he was candidate I think he talked about a rigged system. When you have a system where 150 million Americans get a tax advantage and you don't, you would describe that as a rigged system.  So Republicans, at least one of the proposals that is out there--because it is Senator Cassidy's and mine, known as the World's Greatest Healthcare Plan--employs an opportunity where up front we allow every single American to have health care January 1 that is superior in nature to whatever they had with  It allows the purchase of a nongovernment plan and it allows each individual, if they choose, to go to a health savings account.  What is a health savings account?  A health savings account is a well-known product whereby a family would be able to get what is called major medical coverage. They actually, as part of their plan, would make sure that, if they were in the hospital or a member of their family was in the hospital, they would have to cover the first $5,000, but that the insurance plan then that they could find about affording out of this $8,000 for a family of four would give them a chance then to have either a 90/10, 80/20, or 70/30 contribution. Meaning they could decide what they wanted to afford based upon their age, based upon their risk, based upon their own circumstances. But they, as a consumer, would be able to make sure that they are taken care of if they go in the hospital.  Then that contribution, to the level that they would choose--either they would pay 30 percent or 20 percent or 10 percent for expenses past $10,000--gave them the coverage that they need in the marketplace. Maybe it is a baby. Maybe it is major surgery. Maybe it is cancer. But they would receive hospital coverage.  Then with the remaining amount of money, they could then put that into a health savings account and use cash for their doctor's visits. Cash is king. Cash is also the most economical way to get your health care because you go and actually, instead of negotiating with a doctor or looking at what your insurance company negotiated, you negotiate paying that person today instead of the doctor having to file insurance and go through the necessary elements to receive their money back.  You go to the doctor you choose. You pay for what you want. You pay for those things that you have made a decision, and you pay out of your cash account. It is the most leading edge, fastest way to get health care in America, and, generally speaking, it is 18 percent cheaper.  Mr.Speaker, these are but one of the ideas that Republicans bring to the table.                              {time}  2000  And it is why I can stand up, as chairman of the Rules Committee, when my colleagues say: oh, you are going to take away something that people had with the Affordable Care And I say: you know, I think we have got a better way to look at it.  Instead of only some 27 out of 100 doctors being available to you as a patient, I would like to double or quadruple that. I would like for you to be able to make your own decisions, and, in the long run, you will be better.  But there is more to the story. And the more to the story is, what this will do is allow a robust marketplace where, instead of forcing people to go into a system and then penalizing them, we encourage people to go into a system and encourage them to be not only consumers, and not only to take care of themselves, but to help everybody out because it helps the curve.  It helps people get in of all ages, of all needs, of all types back into the marketplace automatically January 1st. Didn't have to guess at how much money they were going to make; didn't have to worry about whether they got laid off; didn't have to go check with the IRS; didn't have to ask Uncle  We are automatically giving the tax advantage by virtue of them being American and us doing the right thing off the existing money that exists in ObamaCare and health care today.  Mr.Speaker, that is a better idea. That is a better opportunity for us, as Republicans, to go back home, and, no matter who we want to look at, we can say: we get it. We do get that you want and need health care, that we want and need America to have the greatest healthcare system in the world, but we need to make sure we can pay for it. And it should not restrict business. It should not come and tell a business or a group of people what they will--how they will tie themselves together with their health care and their job that makes absolutely no sense.  I know we were told that is the way it would happen, but it did not. It became a concrete life preserver for employees, employers, and for the marketplace.  So, Mr.Speaker, this health insurance tax advantage is but one of the ideas that is available to the American people and to the Republican Party as part of the world's greatest healthcare system.  I believe that we need a very disciplined approach. I believe that we need to be thoughtful. I believe that we need every single Member of Congress to understand what kind of healthcare system America deserves, not only for the physicians and the hospitals back[[Page H598]]home but for the real live people who are called constituents. And we as Members of Congress should know, the day we pass a bill, how we intend it to work.  My colleagues, the Democrats, for 6 years have bumbled around and, even today, don't even understand, nor will they admit, what a disaster ObamaCare is. So, the American people did it for them.  The American people voted in Donald They voted in Republicans to the House in the majority. They voted in Republicans to the And now we are in Washington, and we are going to struggle. We are going to struggle mightily. We are going to throw ideas onto the wall. We are going to have committee hearings. We are going to have the best thought process.  We are going to be able to go back home and to sell to the American people not only some of the ideas that I have but some of the ideas that my colleagues have. And we are going to come up with a better healthcare system.  So what we are about is fix the system before we repeal it. I believe it is wise to say that Republicans owe it to the American people to say: before we go replacing something--before we repeal something, let's replace it. And more and more and more and more of my colleagues are saying this openly. It only makes sense.  We have nothing to fear with a Republican option and an alternative that will be superior for the American people, and every single person will be able to see that. We believe establishing a Republican alternative that can be implemented this year is the best answer.  Now, this is my idea. My idea is, let's go get it on. We know what we are doing. Let's go hold our hearings. Let's go to the American people. Let's sell the ideas that we have got. Let's go move forward and get this process on.  Secondly, we believe that what we have got to do is use reconciliation to repeal the most onerous mandates. What might those be? Well, the individual and the business mandate, the Cadillac tax.  We believe that we have got to go and use the processes, the leverage that we have got. And then we have got to count on what I hope will be the gentleman from Georgia, Tom Price, who is today the chairman of the Budget Committee, but tomorrow has been nominated to be the Secretary of Health and Human  We will count on Tom Price actually sitting in the seat, looking at the exact same law that was overwhelmingly voted by Democrats and no Republicans, and using those levers that he has that were expressly given to the head of HHS to make wise decisions on how to implement the law as we move forward.  I will tell you, Chairman Price, as a physician with a long history of understanding health care, as a provider of health care for years, as an awesome physician, Tom Price knows the problems, and he will use those same opportunities that exist in the law today. Instead of it being something that would be more difficult for a consumer, more difficult for a person on ObamaCare, more difficult for what might be an employer, more difficult and time consuming for a consumer, more costly to the consumers of this country, but, perhaps worst of all, making it harder to provide better health care for a patient, Tom Price will have that opportunity.  So this is a three-tier process for Republicans, for us to also bring the best ideas. The American people should be checking with their Member of Congress who will be able to understand the Republican alternative. This is great for the American people to know.  We are going to use the levers of laws to change them, to repeal and take back the most onerous parts of ObamaCare, and we are going to work within the law that Mr.Price, as head of HHS, would be able to use exactly the same levers that someone sat there, if they really wanted to fix health care instead of making it harder for someone.  We know that Republicans have better ideas, and that what we want to do is to establish a tax benefit system while allowing the employer-sponsored insurance tax system to remain. That means that every single American will have parity on the opportunity to buy health care on January 1 of every year; that no longer will we find that people lag behind because they can't afford, or it is a rigged system, or they have a disadvantage.  Republicans have an opportunity to level the playing field. This is why Republicans openly in any crowd can say: we have better ideas. We don't have to force anybody. We will invite them to come be a part of what we do. And I guarantee you, more people will flock to our system than fled and ran from ObamaCare, because it has to work for everybody, not just some of us.  The healthcare system that we have today, ObamaCare, literally, young people ran from the system. They could not afford it. But worst of all, they could not pay the high deductible. And if you have such a high deductible, it means, by and large, insurance is useless to you.  So, Mr.Speaker, what Republicans are doing is going to allow a tax benefit system. Republicans are going to make HSAs available as an option, an alternative, so that people have a choice and a chance to buy what they need but not pay for what they don't want. We want an opportunity for them to become consumers. We want them to be a part of a system where it is not use it or lose it, rather, they can only, through their own means and their hard work, roll over perhaps $1,000 a year, $1,000 at 21, $1,000 at 22, $1,000 at 23, and to allow private physicians to make sure they are in the system.  Lastly, as my time is moving forward, I want to say something to each and every American because it seemingly has been a part of the lexicon in my Democrat friends' viewpoint, and it is this: The Republican plan has available to it and, I believe, will accept the rights that were known as under ObamaCare, which were very bipartisan, dependent coverage through age 26--Republican plan, you bet. No lifetime annual limits--Republican plan, absolutely. Modified guarantee availability renewability, just like what was in ObamaCare--you bet we will have that too.  Prohibition on preexisting conditions exclusions--literally, just the same. You have to buy in. And if you don't, then you have a problem. But if you buy in the first time you get a chance, it is an opportunity just like  Prohibition on discrimination based on health status--absolutely. That is a Republican idea, too. It is not owned by just one party. It is a generally accepted idea and would be a part, should be a part, of a Republican plan, and nondiscrimination and healthcare coverage.  Mr.Speaker, what I have tried to do in this hour is to give the American people and my colleagues the confidence that what lies ahead will be an awesome debate, but it will be done in public. It will be done above board. It will be done where Members of Congress can go back home and explain to people not only what we want to do but be willing to take their own feedback also.  It will be a system that will fix the inequities, the things that were unfair about tax benefits. And it should be, and I hope will be, a system that will be available this next year so that, on January 1 of this next year, as we find the American people wanting eagerly to look at the health care that their families would want and need, that they will find a tax benefit that is consistent with what any other American gets.  Now, the last point I would like to say is a thank you. I would like to say a thank you to some 500 physicians of the National Physicians' Policy Council who have worked through, for 2 years, 9 very large meetings across this country, the last one, the first week of December here in  John Gill, national co-chairman, and Marcy Zwelling--Gill is from Zwelling is from Los Angeles--and our 16 vice chairmen, who have devoted not only hard work but a belief that a healthcare change should be done with physicians, with the people who care about not only patients but care about the system that they would be engaged in, the system of health care in America, that is the greatest system that we know of.                              {time}  2015  They have sent me hundreds of ideas and hundreds of things which we have openly discussed where we rubbed elbows trying to decide how do we hone[[Page H599]]this idea. It has come down to every single American should end up with a better healthcare system than one that was designed that they could not explain and still leaves some 30 million people uninsured in America, and that is called We should not have a system that demands that a person be on that system or have to pay a huge fine. We would want a system where people gleefully came to it, liked their healthcare system, became a consumer, were proud of what they got, and perhaps more importantly, could go to the doctor of their choice instead of calling a number and being assigned or take the person that they were given.  Mr.Speaker, there are lots of ways to get things done in this country, but Republicans have, for years, had better ideas. The idea on health care is one that Republicans are eager--eager--not only to accept this challenge, but eager to say that we are going to work together. Speaker Ryan has pledged himself to our We have Members of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell--the other body--and there are a number of Members, including Bill Cassidy and Rand Paul who have come out with their own healthcare bills, ways to attract not just other cosponsors, but their colleagues who are Democrats also.  So I would say tonight to my colleagues: I would like for you to take just a minute to look at the world's greatest healthcare plan. I would like for you to be concerned, instead of the some 12 to 20 million people across the country--everybody has their own congressional district, and there might be a large number in some of their districts. But by and large, the vast number would not be on ObamaCare, and each of our Members owe them a better healthcare system also.  But if we all get together, every single person can have the opportunity to have a nondiscriminatory system where virtually every hospital would take your coverage instead of only a few. ObamaCare is only a few, only a few doctors. And if we work together and form larger team sizes, we can make health care even better for all  So, Mr.Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity tonight to talk about not only better ideas to fix health care, but it would be done through a deliberate, disciplined approach, one in which every single Member of this body should be able to describe what they want. If they want to be for ObamaCare and say that only 24 percent of physicians and only a few hospitals will take their plan, then let them stand on that.  But I want to be for a system where virtually every hospital and virtually every doctor would take the healthcare plan that I would like my family to be on and them, also. That is why I stand up tonight and speak favorably about the Republican advantages of where we will head, specifically about the world's greatest healthcare plan that Senator Bill Cassidy and I have cosponsored and, more specifically, that the American people can be sold by every single one of us to make health care work and be better for each and every  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH594-3.txt,1548,DUCKS UNLIMITED'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY,2017.0,23.0,January
13289,topic-id,1302,"Mr.President, on this International Women's Day, we celebrate the remarkable social, economic, and political achievements of women around the world, but we also take stock of the barriers that continue to prevent hundreds of millions of women from contributing their talents as equal members of the human family.  As in years past, this year I am again joining with Senator Susan Collins in submitting a bipartisan resolution commemorating International Women's Day and highlighting its goal of advancing the equality and empowerment of women all across the globe. I especially appreciate Senator Collins'[[Page S1696]]unwavering support in working with me on this resolution.  It has been said that no nation can get ahead if it leaves half of its people behind, and in the 21st century, wherever women are respected and treated as equals, we excel, as the Presiding Officer knows, as legislators, as scientists, as entrepreneurs, artists, inventors, warriors, and in every other field. But the harsh reality remains that women make up some 51 percent of the world's population, yet we account for an estimated 70 percent of those living in poverty and two-thirds of those denied even a basic education.  So on this International Women's Day, we celebrate women's achievements, and we rededicate ourselves to achieving an equal voice, equal participation, and equal rights for all women. We also acknowledge that we still have much difficult work ahead of us.  Research tells us that women and girls' equality can be transformational for their communities and for entire countries, yet in some of the poorest parts of the world--and even in some wealthier countries--women and girls continue to be held back by injustices such as child marriage, sexual and domestic violence, denial of education, and lack of access to contraception and maternal healthcare.  In recent years, we have learned more about the intersection of so many of these issues that affect women. When girls are forced into early marriage, when women are denied contraception and have children at a very young age, this typically ends any chance to gain an education and income-earning employment. This lack of economic influence means that women remain powerless within their families and, too often, within their communities. And this, in turn, can lead to violence against women and the denial of women's most basic human and civil rights.  The good news is that this same interconnectedness can work to empower women and to lift up communities. When women and girls' rights are respected, when we have access to education and family planning services, this unleashes women's ability to participate equally in the community, in the workplace, and even in the political arena.  Indeed, we can now quantify so many of the positive ripple effects. For example, each additional year of education increases a woman's income by 25 percent. We know that children born to educated mothers are twice as likely to survive past the age of 5. By mobilizing the talents of the previously neglected half of the population--in too many places--we create more stable societies and more rapid economic development.  For decades, the United States has been a world leader in advancing and protecting the rights of women and girls around the world, including their access to contraception and family planning. In particular, I want to applaud the excellent work of the State Department's Office of Global Women's I am sponsoring legislation in this session to give this office permanent authorization, with an ambassador leading it.  However, on this International Women's Day, we must also acknowledge actions to abdicate America's leadership role in advancing women's rights. Indeed, both at home and abroad, the Trump administration has exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive rights. President Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices who will overturn Roe v. He has joined with some of the Republican leaders in Congress in pledging to terminate funding for Planned  In one of his first official acts, the President signed an Executive order reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule. This rule prohibits U.financial aid to many international organizations that offer contraception and comprehensive family planning services to women.  As if the reinstatement of this policy weren't bad enough, the administration's Executive order dramatically expanded the policy to apply to all U.S.-funded global health programs--so not just family planning and counseling programs. But we believe that this expansion will include our HIV/AIDS program, known as PEPFAR, which has been so positive in saving so many lives in It was started by George We also think it will affect initiatives that fund the fights against the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, and this puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and their families around the world.  Taken together, all of these actions by the new administration I believe amount to an assault on the safety and well-being of women and girls across the globe.  I have joined with Senator Susan Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and 45 other Senators in introducing bipartisan legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule. I believe--and it is well documented--that this is a misguided policy that ignores decades of research.  We shouldn't allow extreme ideology to triumph over the urgent practical needs of women across the world. The facts make clear that when family planning services are accessible and contraceptives are affordable, rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions go down.  According to the World Health Organization, there is an estimated 225 million women in the world who would like access to family planning services, and we know that makes a difference. Here in the United States, the abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level since 1943, a success that is directly attributable to the reduced cost sharing for contraception under the Affordable Care I can attest to that because in New Hampshire, we have one of the lowest incidences of teen pregnancy in the country.  In January, we saw millions of women, men, and children, turn out for marches in Washington, New York, London, Nairobi, Tokyo, in my home capital of Concord, NH, and in dozens of other cities across the country and around the world. I think we can look at that as an early celebration of International Women's Day because what we heard from those marching was that we were marching in defense of the rights of American women, of Muslim women, of women of color, and of all women and girls across the globe.  The world heard our message loudly and clearly. We will not allow our reproductive rights and our human rights to be taken away. We will not allow women to be targeted for discrimination. We will not be taken backward.  That was our message in January, and it is our message on this International Women's We have fought long and hard for equal rights and equal treatment here in the United  We are also celebrating women here in the United We have many women who have taken the day off to recognize the role that women play that is so significant in our society, and many of us are also wearing red to demonstrate that. So on this day of celebration and solidarity, we are determined to go forward to build on the progress of recent decades, and we rededicate ourselves to achieving respect, equality, and justice for every woman in every community and every country across the globe.

13307,topic-id,191,"Mr.President, I just wanted to say how pleased I am to be able to join my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor for her official maiden address. It is so nice to see so many of our women colleagues here for this as well.  As she pointed out, I just wanted to echo the great work Senator Hassan has done, especially as Governor, in expanding the Medicaid Program in New Hampshire so that it provides treatment for so many people, especially when it comes to the heroin and opioid epidemic, and why we are so concerned about any efforts to roll that back--because that would kick thousands of people in New Hampshire off of treatment with nowhere else to go. I certainly plan to continue to join her as we fight for this effort, and I know our colleagues are going to help us in that. I believe that if we all work together, we can make progress, as she has so eloquently stated.  So congratulations to Senator Hassan for her first official maiden speech.

13461,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, as my colleagues know, I have been coming to the floor week after week to recognize an Alaskan who has made a difference in his or her community. As I have said repeatedly--I am a little biased, of course--I have the honor of living in the most beautiful State in the country, but it is our people who truly make it special. They are resilient, kind, and giving. And it is the next generation that is going to continue to make my State the best place in the world to live.  This week I would like to introduce my colleagues to 18-year-old Ivory Gerhardt Cyrus, this week's Alaskan of the Ivory lives in Kiana, a beautiful, close-knit Inupiat village of less than 400 people on the banks of the Kobuk River in Northwest Like many villages in Alaska, there are no roads in and out. People travel to Kotzebue, which is the closest hub city--it is not very much of a city but a big village--about 40 miles away by plane or snow machine, boat, or sometimes dog team. That is where Ivory was raised--in Kiana--and where, against many odds, she has strived.  Ivory was born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which made getting through school a challenge. She was at times misunderstood, at times bullied, and many didn't know how to deal with her properly.  About 120 kids each year are diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in When she was in middle school, Ivory began committing herself to helping them by speaking out about her own experiences and by advocating the way students with behavioral issues are treated in school. She was an advocate for them.  Now she is an honor roll high school senior, graduating this spring, and along the way, she has become a State of Alaska trainer for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. She gave a presentation at an international conference recently on disability and diversity, and she was named one of five recipients of the 27th annual Women of Achievement and Youth Awards in  This is what I find most impressive about Ivory: She is passing a message of hope and service on to her peers. She started a group, encouraging the members of the group to do one positive thing each day. The name of the group is appropriately entitled ``One Positive Thing,'' or ``OPT.'' That message has spread throughout her community, and now villages in Kiana are remembering to do one positive thing each day for themselves, their families, and their community. Last year, she held her first OPT conference in Kiana for youth all across the region. This year, that conference--the next OPT conference, One Positive Thing--will be held on April 7 and 8.  Ivory is an exceptional young woman. She is going to go on to do exceptional things. Next fall, she plans on attending the University of Alaska Anchorage where she plans to continue to do one positive thing each day and will bring that positive attitude to the students at She is going to continue to encourage others to do that as well.  I congratulate her for all of her accomplishments, for being our Alaskan of the Week, and congratulations to her parents, Jean and Tom, for the wonderful job they have done in raising this exceptional young lady.

Cabinet Nominations  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1142-3.txt,1534,MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,14.0,March
13434,topic-id,1350,"Mr.President, yesterday we began yet another week of considering Cabinet nominations in the Senate--our fourth week, to be precise--and we still have a long way to go. If anyone is wondering whether this is a normal confirmation process, the answer is no, it is not. Historically, Senate practice has been to quickly confirm a President's Cabinet nominees. President Obama had six nominees confirmed on his first day as President and nearly all the rest within the first 2 weeks. This tradition of speedy confirmation goes back a long way. By the point in every Presidency since President Eisenhower's, most, if not all, of the President's Cabinet nominees had been confirmed by now. Between 1881 and 1933, every incoming President had all of his Cabinet nominees confirmed on day one.  What is the reason for this? Historically, Senators of both parties have recognized that Cabinet officials play an essential part in getting an administration up and running, doing the business of the American people. Once the American people elect a President, the thinking historically has gone that it is only right that the President be given the advisers he needs to do the job he was elected to do--that is, until now.  This year, Democrats decided that they have had enough of timely Cabinet confirmations, that they have had enough of bipartisanship. Since President Trump was inaugurated, Democrats have done everything they can to drag out his Cabinet nominations. We don't have to take my word for it; here is what Politico had to say:       Senate Democrats . . . are slow-walking the installation of      Trump's Cabinet to a historic degree. . . . They are voting      against Trump's Cabinet picks in unprecedented numbers.  Two weeks ago, the Washington Post published a piece titled ``Trump's confirmations really are taking longer than his predecessors.''  ``Democrats,'' the Post noted, ``have tried to slow the process, invoking arcane parliamentary procedure to force delays, and boycotting committee meetings to prevent votes.''  For a party that has spent a lot of time complaining about obstruction, Democrats really are taking it to new heights. Thanks to Democrats' obstruction, the Senate has had to spend so much time confirming nominees that we have had very little time for actual legislative business. We still have a long way to go to finish confirming the President's Cabinet, unless the Democrats decide to stop their obstruction. Democrats aren't even really accomplishing anything with their delays.  Thanks to the rules change that they put in place in 2013--that was something that was engineered in 2013 where they literally broke the rules to change the rules--they can't actually prevent President Trump's nominees from being confirmed. The only thing they can do is to tie up the business of the Senate and delay work on legislation to address the challenges that are facing American families.  Democrats may not like President Trump, but it is high time they get used to the fact that he is our Democrats are not helping anyone by preventing the President from having a fully functioning administration. It is time for Democrats to abandon the obstruction, confirm the President's nominees, and allow the Senate to move forward with the business of the American people.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, in addition to Cabinet nominees, the Senate will be considering another key nomination in the coming weeks, and that is Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  I met with Judge Gorsuch last week, and our meeting confirmed my opinion that President Trump could not have made a better pick for the By now, I think Judge Gorsuch's qualifications are well known: his exceptional intelligence, his gift for the written word, his outstanding resume, and, most of all, his clear understanding of the proper role of a judge.  In his remarks at the White House after accepting the nomination, Judge Gorsuch spoke of judges' obligation to follow the law ``as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs.''  ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.'' Judge Gorsuch has said those words more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law.  That is a problem. The job of a judge is to interpret the law, not write it--to call the balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of the game. Everyone's rights are put in jeopardy when judges step outside of their role and start changing the meaning of the law to suit their personal opinions.  Judge Gorsuch doesn't just understand judges' responsibility; he lives it. He has won respect from liberals and conservatives alike for his deep commitment to following the law wherever[[Page S1149]]it leads, even when he doesn't like the results.  Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have seen him up close and in action, both in court and      on the Federal Appellate Rules Committee (where both of us      serve); he brings a sense of fairness and decency to the job,      and a temperament that suits the nation's highest court. . .      . I, for one, wish it were a Democrat choosing the next      justice.       But since that is not to be, one basic criteria should be      paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up for the      rule of law and say no to a president or Congress that strays      beyond the Constitution and laws?       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help      to restore confidence in the rule of law.       His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial      independence--a record that should give the American people      confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the      president who appointed him.  Again, those are not the words of a That is what Neal Katyal, formerly an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge It is pretty high praise coming from a  One of the Democrats' favorite tactics is to accuse Republican nominees of being extremists, no matter how mainstream they actually are. No matter how hard they try, I don't think they are going to have much success with that tactic against Judge  When liberal after liberal attests to his fairness and impartiality, it is pretty hard to pretend he is anything but an excellent pick for the Supreme  Then there are the stats from his time on the Tenth Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported:       Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining      the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.       Only 1.75 percent (14 opinions) drew dissents from his      colleagues.       That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous, even on a      circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by      Democratic Presidents and five by  So it is a very divided circuit court in terms of the composition. Let me repeat that last line.       That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a      circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by      Democratic Presidents and five by  When 98 percent of your opinions are unanimous, it is pretty much impossible to argue that you are somehow outside of the judicial mainstream. Very few of Judge Gorsuch's decisions have gone to the Supreme When they have, they have been almost universally upheld--often, unanimously. I wish Democrats luck in portraying Judge Gorsuch as an extremist. I think they are going to have a very uphill climb.  Both liberals and conservatives recognize that Judge Gorsuch is a supremely qualified jurist who would make a terrific addition to the Supreme I hope that Senate Democrats will listen to the consensus in favor of his nomination and abandon their threats of obstruction. Democrats spend a lot of time talking about the importance of confirming a ninth Justice to the Now they are going to have a chance to confirm an outstanding nominee. I hope they take it.

We know that American values are threatened when politicians try to break apart a health care system that has extended medical benefits to millions of Americans, and we know that American values are threatened when a President tries to stack his government with billionaires and insiders who have a history of grinding working people into the dirt.  Yesterday something happened that is a threat to our American values. President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme For years now, I have repeated this warning: America's promise of equal justice under the law is in danger. Over the last three decades, as the[[Page S559]]rich have grown richer and middle-class families have struggled, the scales of justice have also tilted, tilted in favor of the wealthy and the powerful.  This is not an accident. It is part of a deliberate strategy to turn our courts into one more rigged game for folks at the top, and its effects have been devastating. Recent court decisions have protected giant businesses from accountability, made it harder for people who have been injured or cheated to get a hearing, gutted longstanding laws protecting consumers who have been swindled, and unleashed a flood of secret money into our politics that is rapidly tilting the entire government in favor of the wealthy.  Billionaires and corporate giants have launched a full-scale attack on fair-minded, mainstream judges. It has happened at every level of our judiciary, but the best example was the unprecedented blockade of Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Judge Garland was an obvious consensus nominee and a straight shooter who followed the law. Why block him? The problem was that Judge Garland's career didn't reflect a sufficient willingness to bend the law to suit the needs of the rich and powerful. And for that sin, far-right groups, financed by Big Business interests, spent millions of dollars attacking him, to torpedo his nomination and keep that seat open.  They did something else that is even more damaging: Far-right groups also drew up a list of ``acceptable'' Supreme Court nominees, people who demonstrated they were sympathetic to the rich and the powerful. Judge Neil Gorsuch made the cut, and his nomination is their reward.  Judge Gorsuch is intelligent and accomplished. He is polite, respectful, and articulate. Make no mistake, his professional record, which I have reviewed in detail, clearly and consistently favors the interests of big corporations over workers, big corporations over consumers, and big corporations over pretty much anybody else.  Let's not mince words. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch is a huge gift to the giant corporations and wealthy individuals who have stolen a Supreme Court seat in order to make sure that the justice system works for them. What I am saying shouldn't be controversial. They haven't made a secret of what they were doing. This is exactly why Judge Gorsuch has been on their list for 4 months. He is the payoff for their multimillion-dollar investment.  Throughout his professional career, Judge Gorsuch has shown a truly remarkable insensitivity to the struggles of working Americans and an eagerness to side with businesses that break the rules over workers who are seeking justice.  Even before he became a judge, Judge Gorsuch famously argued in favor of limiting the ability of investors and shareholders to bring lawsuits when companies commit fraud, whining about how annoying it is for billionaire corporations to have to face their investors when they cheat them.  As a judge for more than a decade, he has twisted himself into a pretzel to make sure that the rules favor giant companies over workers and individual Let me just count some of the ways. He has sided with employers who deny wages, employers who improperly fire workers, employers who retaliate against whistleblowers for misconduct. He has sided with employers who denied retirement benefits to their workers. He has sided with big insurance companies against disabled workers who were denied benefits. He has ruled against workers in all kinds of discrimination cases. He has even argued that the rights of corporations outweigh the rights of the people working for them, for example, allowing businesses to assert religious beliefs so they can limit their employees' access to health care.  Listen to that one again. He thinks that a company can assert a religious belief and decide whether female employees get access to birth control. Let's be clear. That means a lot of employees will be living at the whim of their employers.  Judge Gorsuch has written dismissively about lawsuits to vindicate the rights of vulnerable people. Equal marriage? Assisted suicide? Keep those issues out of his courtroom.  He is willing to open the doors wide when big corporations show up in his court to challenge health and safety rules they don't like or regulations to prevent them from polluting our air and water, poisoning our food, undermining our public safety, or just plain cheating people. When that happens, Judge Gorsuch is ready to go, to override the rules with his own views. On that score, he is even more extreme than Justice  This is exactly the type of Supreme Court Justice that giant corporations want, but they have never been quite so brazen about it. Spending millions to slime a consensus straight shooter nominee like Merrick Garland and steal a Supreme Court seat, then drawing up a public list of ``acceptable'' alternatives and handing it over to a billionaire President so he can do his buddies a favor. That is bold. That is bold, and that is not how America is supposed to work.  Our courts are supposed to be neutral arbiters, dispensing justice based on the facts and the law, not people chosen to advance the interests of those at the top.  Let's be clear. This fundamental principle might be more important today than it has ever been in modern history. Every day our new President finds more ways to demonstrate his hostility for an independent judiciary, for a civil society, and for the rule of law. That is precisely the reason that our Constitution gives us a neutral, independent judiciary. We don't need Justices who have been handpicked for their willingness to kowtow to those with money, power, and influence. We need Justices who will stand up to those with money, power, and influence.  Judge Gorsuch may occasionally write in vague terms about the importance of the independent courts. Today, right now, that simply is not good enough. Now, more than ever, the United States needs a Supreme Court that puts the law first every single time. That means Justices with a proven record of standing up for the rights of all Americans--civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and all the protections guaranteed by our laws.  We cannot stand down when American values and constitutional principles are attacked. We cannot stand down when the President of the United States hands our highest Court over to the highest bidder, and that is why I will oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  Mr.President, I yield.

First, the underlying bill requires the GAO to conduct a study on succession planning at the That is intended to try to better understand the problem the agency has to have a pipeline of qualified candidates to assume critical roles that are open.  My amendment would require the GAO to study and analyze succession planning and hiring in rural areas. The vast majority of our country is rural, so we have got to put an emphasis on that. The challenges in rural America are different than in the urban areas.  Second, the underlying bill also requires the VA to collect information on[[Page H2163]]hiring effectiveness: the time it takes to fill a vacant position, the attrition rate, the reason staff leaves, investment in training and development, and other barriers to recruitment and training. My amendment would require that study to focus on the rural challenges that are different, significantly, than in the urban areas.  The lack of qualified candidates that the VA can recruit and, ultimately, fill open positions with is a real problem. But we have to recognize that that is even more difficult in rural  In Vermont, we have 50,000 veterans living in the State and only nine VA facilities to help them. These are some of the satellite facilities that are quite small. Our largest facility is White River Junction, the VA Medical Center there that we are very proud of. It provided medical care for over 26,000 of those veterans in 2016. The director there has indicated to me that it is a real struggle to find qualified candidates to fill mission-critical positions.  We had, at that facility, a wonderful neuropsychologist--desperately needed--but that person was married, had children, and due to the inability of her husband to find a job within his field of work, they have left the VA there to go to an urban area. This is one variation of the problem we face--to recruit, to hire, and to retain critical personnel--that needs to be addressed in rural areas.  My amendment will help us better understand the unique challenges rural America faces dealing with the critical staff shortages at our veterans facilities and sets the stage for us to fix the problem.

13471,topic-id,387,"Mr.Chair, my manager's amendment makes a number of minor technical changes to the reported version of the bill and would significantly reduce discretionary costs while maintaining the overall intent of the bill.  The biggest change that would be made in the manager's amendment is the removal of section 11 of the bill, which would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to track a number of hiring effectiveness metrics.  That section alone scored at $6 million because the Congressional Budget Office expected that the VA would have to hire an additional employee in each Veterans Integrated Service Network in order to gather that information. I disagree with that assertion and I intend to continue working on that provision to, hopefully, include it in future legislation in some form.  In addition, the manager's amendment would authorize but not require the VA to track and match qualified job applicants for vacant positions using the recruiting database that the bill would establish. The CBO estimated that the VA would have to hire up to 40 additional employees with an average compensation of $100,000 per year to accomplish that task, meaning that provision in total would cost $19 million. Again, I disagree with the assertion that such a task could not be accomplished using existing staff.  The Subcommittee on Health, which I am proud to chair, is holding an oversight hearing next week where I intend[[Page H2159]]to ask the VA how the Department would utilize the recruiting database and whether it would entail additional employees. Should it appear that the VA would not use the recruiting database to identify qualified candidates for open positions in a timely manner and to promptly fill prolonged vacancies, I will certainly reconsider mandating that in future legislation.  The manager's amendment would also stipulate that the additional human resources training that the bill would require be done virtually. Finally, it would extend the timeline to implement the executive management fellowship program from 90 days to 1 year, which would provide the VA additional time to set up this important new leadership development program and would extend the GAO reporting deadline from 1 to 2 years, which would provide the GAO additional time to complete their investigation into the VA succession planning.

13526,topic-id,199,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of Representative O'Rourke's amendment, which would allow the VA to offer physicians conditional job offers 2 years prior to the completion of their residency, and also require VA recruiters or other officials to visit each teaching institution with a residency program at least once a[[Page H2167]]year. It is a great idea and one that I greatly appreciate.  The VA's existing workforce is increasingly retirement-eligible, and, historically, the VA has performed poorly in comparison to other Federal agencies when it comes to hiring younger employees.  By creating a pipeline of young, up-and-coming physicians willing to practice in VA medical facilities and committed to VA service, this amendment would help ensure that the VA healthcare system is fully staffed to care for our veterans for years to come.  The text of this amendment passed the House last year as an amendment to H.5620, and I am grateful to Representative O'Rourke for submitting it as an amendment to H.1367 today.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

13431,topic-id,1265,"Mr.President, I listened carefully to my colleagues on the[[Page S1146]]other side, and I want to make sure people really understand what this debate is all about. This debate is about background checks. It is about mental health. It is not about taking away constitutional rights. I am struck--and I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has taken part in a lot of these debates as well--that whenever there is a discussion about guns in the U.Senate, Senators get up and say: We shouldn't be debating guns, we ought to be debating mental health. That is what we are talking about today--mental health and background checks.  The fact is, we can go into townhall meetings in any part of America and hear extraordinary support for the whole idea of background checks. Background checks are right at the heart of this morning's debate and supporting background checks is not some extreme far-out position to hold. In fact, opposing background checks is the view that is way out of the mainstream of American political thought.  A recent poll found that 92 percent of gun owners supported expanded background checks. Let me just repeat that 92 percent of gun owners in America support expanded background checks. As the courts continue to interpret the language of the Second Amendment, one matter has been made clear: background checks are a constitutional part of the exercise of those rights.  So what I am going to do is describe what this is all about, but I want to, as we get going, make sure people understand that fundamentally this is about background checks, and it is about mental health. It is not about taking away somebody's constitutional rights.  Here is how the proposal under discussion works. If there is an individual with a severe mental impairment that means that another person--perhaps a family member--is in charge of their Social Security benefits, then the background check is to be informed by Social Security that the person with a severe mental impairment is ineligible to buy a gun. The fact is, we can always talk about tailoring the rule in a slightly different way. It is critically important that individuals who wind up in the background check system are not treated unfairly, but the fact is, anyone who thinks they have been unfairly affected by this proposal can appeal, and they are most likely going to win, as long as they are not a danger to themselves or anyone else. If the Social Security Administration says no, that person has the power to take their case to court.  What we are talking about here is, in my view, not about Democrats or Republicans, liberals and conservatives; I think we are just talking about plain old, unvarnished common sense. We want to, all of us--all of us--stop shootings by those who are in danger of hurting themselves or other persons.  The rule came out last year, but it goes back to the shootings at Virginia Tech and Sandy What the previous administration sought to do was to find some commonsense gun safety steps that could be taken under laws on the books. I want to emphasize this as well because whenever we talk about guns, what Senators always say is: Let's use the laws on the books. Let's use the laws on the books. We don't need to chase new laws and the like.  So the administration sought to use the laws on the books--the previous administration--to prevent the horrendous acts of violence that have so scarred our country in recent years. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer knows something about that from his own  I hope my colleagues will oppose the resolution. I think we are all aware in the Senate that whenever you have an issue that even touches on guns, everybody goes into their corners. They go into their respective corners.  My own view is--and I represent a State with a great many gun owners. I have had more than 750 townhall meetings at home. A lot of them--a lot of them--involve debates about guns. Overwhelmingly, in a State like mine, where there are a lot of gun owners, gun owners support making sure there are background checks. They want to address this as a mental health issue. Gun owners overwhelmingly say they have just had it with Congress doing absolutely nothing when it comes to practical, commonsense gun measures like background checks. They look at what goes on in Washington, DC--and I have had so many gun owners--and this comes up not just at town meetings. We have an icon in our State, Fred Meyer, a store. I think I have had chicken in every Fred Meyer in the State of People come up and talk about issues like this in a Fred Meyer, and they ask: Why in the world can't there be Democrats and Republicans who just come together and do something that helps make our country a little bit safer? That is what this is all about.  I am not here to say this measure is a panacea; that somehow this is a magical elixir that is going to reduce gun violence in That wouldn't be right and certainly not part of how I see these debates. I see this as addressing a commonsense, practical measure relating to background checks and mental health.  I listened to my colleague, my friend from the Finance Committee, Senator If Members of the Senate feel so strongly that this particular rule needs addressing, then there ought to be a debate. The Senate, Democrats and Republicans, should get together and figure out how to improve the rule.  What is important is that is not going to be possible if this resolution passes. If this rule is struck down under the Congressional Review Act, it wouldn't just scrap this particular background check, it would salt the It would prevent this issue from being addressed for quite a number of years.  I am going to close by talking a bit personally for a minute about why I feel so strongly about this. My late brother Jeff, who passed at the age of 51, suffered from schizophrenia, a serious mental impairment. He started to withdraw in his teens. His condition got worse over the next few years. We were close. He was just a couple of years younger than I watched the continuing odyssey that Jeff went through of various mental health facilities, run-ins with the law on the streets.  I will say to the Presiding Officer that not a day went by in the Wyden household when we weren't worried that Jeff was going to hurt himself or somebody else. That was the reality for the Wyden family, and that is a fear that I know is felt in households all across the country, day in and day out.  My brother received benefits from public programs while he struggled with a mental impairment. My dad wrote a book about it because we were so hopeful at one time. He wrote a book called ``Conquering Schizophrenia.'' We thought there was a breakthrough drug known as olanzapine.  We always felt during those years that it would be a big mistake if Jeff Wyden could buy a gun. He would have been a danger to himself. He would have been a danger to others. I don't think Americans should have to carry that burden and experience that kind of worry that comes along with the danger we felt week after week for years in the Wyden household and that I know other families across the country feel as well.

13440,topic-id,559,"Mr.President, today I, along with 13 of my Senate colleagues, am introducing the Presidential Trade Transparency Act of 2017. This bill establishes new reporting requirements directing the President to disclose foreign income, assets, and liabilities when initiating or continuing trade or investment negotiations with a foreign country, taking or refraining to take certain trade enforcement actions, or granting or modifying preferential tariff treatment under statutory trade preference programs. Each of these decisions may have significant commercial implications, both as to a foreign country's economy as a whole and with respect to particular investments within a foreign country. Given the complexity and lack of transparency with respect to the President's finances, additional country-specific reporting is necessary for Congress to properly exercise its oversight responsibilities and assess whether the authority it has granted to the President is the subject of undue influence due to a business relationship between the President and one or more foreign entities. Reporting of this information will also help address questions regarding improper influence by foreign entities when the President exercises trade authorities granted by  Americans have a right to know if the President is looking out for the good of the country or just his own bottom line when he negotiates a trade deal, decides whether or not to enforce our trade laws, or decides whether to cut tariffs on imports from a developing country. The President has business interests around the world, but he continues to keep the full nature of those ties secret.  Under the Constitution, Congress is responsible for regulating foreign commerce, including setting U.tariff rates applicable to imports from foreign countries. However, Congress has granted the President limited authority to modify U.tariffs in certain circumstances, including to enforce U.laws protecting U.industry from harmful trade or to address foreign trade barriers, to negotiate trade agreements that eliminate foreign barriers to U.exports, and to grant developing countries preferential access to the U.market.  In many instances, the President himself is granted this authority and does not exercise it through a Cabinet official. While Congress has granted such authority to the President, it retains the responsibility to ensure that the President uses the authority in a manner consistent with congressional objectives.  The bill directs the President to report to Congress information regarding foreign income, assets, and liabilities, consistent with the information required to be disclosed under the Ethics in Government Act, specifically as to any country that is the subject of a trade negotiation, trade enforcement action or inaction, or decision to grant or deny tariff preferences, and to describe in detail the nature of the connection between the income, asset, or liability and the foreign country. The bill specifies deadlines for disclosure of the information with respect to each action that generally track existing deadlines for Presidential reporting under U.law.  Failure to timely submit a report would render without legal effect a Presidential proclamation modifying U.tariffs with respect to the country and, with respect to a trade agreement, would disqualify the agreement from eligibility for expedited consideration under trade promotion authority.  Passage of this bill would close a key loophole in congressional oversight authorities over trade and shine much needed daylight on the financial relationship between the President and America's trading partners.  I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the Finance Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1306.txt,1247,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,16.0,January
