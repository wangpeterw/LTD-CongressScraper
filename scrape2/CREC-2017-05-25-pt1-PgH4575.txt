                       WELCOME TO ROLLING THUNDER

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the veterans from 
Rolling Thunder to Washington for their Memorial Day events. Veterans 
like Gus Dante of Branchburg, New Jersey, serve on Rolling Thunder's 
national board, and every year he and others help organize events here 
in Washington to commemorate those brave Americans lost in war.
  For 30 years, Rolling Thunder's voices and motorcycles have been 
roaring in Washington, and lawmakers and the new administration are 
listening. Veterans' issues are front and center in the Halls of 
Congress, and Secretary Shulkin is reforming the Veterans 
Administration to restore the trust Rolling Thunder and all veterans 
demand.
  We must keep up the fight for the rights and benefits veterans have 
earned in the service to the Nation. I am proud to join with Rolling 
Thunder in introducing two important measures: legislation to end the 
40-mile rule for private care through the VA and legislation to display 
the POW/MIA flag on Federal properties.
  Mr. Speaker, on this commemorative Memorial Day weekend, let us all 
recall those who answered the call of service, especially those who did 
not return home.
