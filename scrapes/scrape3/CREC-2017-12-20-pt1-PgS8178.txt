                          NOMINATION OBJECTION

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous 
consent requests at the present time relating to the nominations of 
David J. Ryder, of New Jersey, to be Director of the Mint, and of 
Isabel Marie Keenan Patelunas, of Pennsylvania, to be Assistant 
Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, Department of the Treasury.
  I will object because the Department of the Treasury has failed to 
respond to a letter I sent on September 29, 2017, to a bureau within 
the Department seeking documents relevant to an ongoing investigation 
by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Despite several phone calls 
between committee staff and Treasury personnel to prioritize particular 
requests within that letter, the Treasury Department has to date failed 
to provide any documents.
  My objection is not intended to question the credentials of Mr. Ryder 
or Ms. Patelunas in any way. However, the Department must recognize 
that it has an ongoing obligation to respond to congressional inquiries 
in a timely and reasonable manner.

                          ____________________
