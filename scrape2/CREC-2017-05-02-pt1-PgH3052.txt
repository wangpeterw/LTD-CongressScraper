                    CELEBRATING SMALL BUSINESS WEEK

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that small businesses 
drive the American economy. Across the United States, small businesses 
create about two out of every three new jobs.
  Since 1963, every President has designated this week National Small 
Business Week to celebrate these economic engines and encourage 
policies that allow them to thrive. When our local small businesses 
succeed, they create opportunity, invigorate communities, and preserve 
the district character of our local economy. That is why I have 
committed to visit 100 small businesses across my district this year 
and every year, to better appreciate the needs of local small 
businesses and help them create good-paying jobs in our community.
  During my visits, I have heard common themes: a Tax Code that is too 
complex, burdensome one-size-fits-all regulations from Washington, and 
lawmakers too focused on partisan bickering rather than on working 
together to grow our economy.
  As we turn our attention to small businesses this week, let's put 
these concerns at the forefront and get to work on solutions.
