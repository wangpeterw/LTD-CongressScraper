               RECOGNIZING THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM & MARY

  (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the College of 
William & Mary's founding by British royal charter 325 years ago on 
February 8, 1693.
  As our Nation's second oldest college, William & Mary has been coined 
the ``Alma Mater of the Nation.'' From George Washington to Thomas 
Jefferson to many of my contemporaries in Congress, William & Mary has 
played an important role in shaping our Nation and its leaders.
  I am proud to say that that tradition continues today. For the last 
325 years, William & Mary has been the place where the world's greatest 
minds come to study. The college is consistently ranked among our 
Nation's most elite public universities and delivers an education that 
is rated among the highest in value for its graduates.
  Many of William & Mary's accomplishments would not have been possible 
without the leadership of President Reveley. On June 30, he will retire 
from William & Mary after 27 years of service to the college, the 
Commonwealth, and the Nation. I want to congratulate President Reveley 
for a job well done and wish him a happy retirement.
