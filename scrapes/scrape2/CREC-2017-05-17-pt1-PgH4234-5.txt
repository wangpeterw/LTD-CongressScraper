           HONORING KIRKERSVILLE POLICE CHIEF STEVEN DiSARIO

  (Mr. TIBERI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, this week is Police Week, a time we honor 
all our officers, especially those who have fallen in the line of duty 
keeping us safe. So today I rise in honor and remember Kirkersville, 
Ohio, Police Chief Steven DiSario.
  Chief DiSario, a father of six with a baby on the way, was killed in 
the line of duty on May 12, 2017. He died at the hands of a gunman who 
also killed two employees at a local nursing home, Marlina Medrano and 
Cindy Krantz.
  This is a tragedy that truly tests the strength of a community, the 
strength of neighbors, and the strength of our law enforcement 
community.
  To Chief DiSario's family: I can't imagine the grief and the anguish 
you must be feeling. We are heartbroken for your loss. Please know that 
your husband, your father, your son, was an American hero. His memory 
will never be forgotten, and it is there that I pray you find hope. 
Today and every day, may God bless you and all our police officers and 
their families.
