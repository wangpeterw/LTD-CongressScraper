           THANKING JAY CHO FOR HIS HARD WORK AND DEDICATION

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank one of my 
longest serving staff members, Jay Cho, who will be departing my team 
this Friday.
  Jay volunteered to be part of my very first intern class. Jay grew to 
be a vital piece of my operation, and in no short time, I asked him to 
join my staff in a permanent capacity.
  He climbed through the ranks of my office, serving as my legislative 
assistant and right hand in handling technology issues for the 
Oversight and Government Reform Committee's IT Subcommittee.
  Jay is the kind of person this Congress and country need more of. 
Forging relationships on both sides of the aisle, his efforts were 
critical in passing legislation to modernize government technology and 
make government websites mobile friendly.
  I am honored to have had the privilege to work with Jay, and on 
behalf of the people of Illinois he served for nearly 5 years, I would 
like to thank him for his hard work and dedication.
