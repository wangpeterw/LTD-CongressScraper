           By Ms. FOXX:
       H.R. 3719.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1 grants Congress the power to 
     ``pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and 
     general Welfare of the United States.'' Article 1, Section 8, 
     Clause 18 grants Congress the power to ``make all Laws which 
     shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the 
     foregoing Powers.'' As this legislation concerns oversight of 
     federal spending on programs authorized by Congress, it is an 
     appropriate use of the authority granted to Congress by the 
     above clauses of the Constitution.
