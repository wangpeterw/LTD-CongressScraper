                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, in these dangerous, divisive, and challenging 
times, You continue to be our refuge and strength. Deliver our 
lawmakers from fear, doubt, weariness, and impatience as they learn to 
trust the unfolding of Your powerful providence. Lord, eliminate from 
their lives the forces that would destroy their peace of mind. Give 
them Your mercy that will make them more forgiving, Your strength that 
will make them more resolute to do Your will, and Your grace that will 
empower them to experience the ultimate triumph of Your purposes.
  Lord, remind our national and world leaders that words matter and 
that the power of life and death is in the tongue. Provide us all with 
the patience to continue to plant and water the seeds of justice and 
truth.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
