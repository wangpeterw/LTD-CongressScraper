         RECOGNIZING WAKULLA COUNTY TEACHER KATRINA RODDENBERRY

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
teacher from Wakulla County, Florida's Second Congressional District.

[[Page H1232]]

  Katrina Roddenberry, a science teacher at Wakulla Middle School, was 
selected by the Space Foundation as one of 31 educators worldwide who 
were honored for her work promoting science and space curricula at 
Wakulla Middle School. Along with this honor, Ms. Roddenberry and her 
colleague, Melissa Martin, were selected to work with NASA as part of 
their Microgravity University for Educators 2018 Challenge.
  This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will give these teachers and four 
of their students the chance to work directly with the experts at NASA. 
It is clear that they are inspiring a love of science and space in 
their students. These teachers are forming not just strong minds but 
also strong characters and big hearts in young men and women with a 
sense of community.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Ms. Roddenberry and 
thanking her for instilling a love of science and space in our next 
generation
