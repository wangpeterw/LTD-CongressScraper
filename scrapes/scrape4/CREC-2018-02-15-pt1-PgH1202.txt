                        HONORING SHELAGH SWEENEY

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FASO. Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to 
recognize Hurley Fire Department member Shelagh Sweeney.
  Shelagh was named Hurley Fire Department's first female Firefighter 
of the Year. Her service and dedication to her community as a 
firefighter, EMT, and field training officer for mobile life support 
services is most admirable.
  Her inspiration to join the fire department came from her attendance 
of a first-aid class during her time at SUNY Ulster. Continuing her 
education by taking classes at Marist College is a testament to the 
dedication she reflects with her service to her community.
  Shelagh's selfless service to the community, while striving for 
further personal growth, is greatly appreciated, and I wish her the 
best in continuing on her journey.
