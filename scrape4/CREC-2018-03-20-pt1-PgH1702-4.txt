                                 PRAYER

  Dr. Michael S. Lewis, Roswell Street Baptist Church, Marietta, 
Georgia, offered the following prayer:
  Our Father in Heaven, we enter into Your presence this day with 
thanksgiving in our hearts for the gracious gift of life and the 
opportunities that You have set before us. We bless You for being our 
Creator and for providing a living relationship of love through Your 
Son and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
  We humble ourselves before You as men and women of this special body 
whom You have appointed with the responsibility of serving the people 
of this Nation. May You fill the minds of each leader with wisdom which 
is from above, fill each heart with passion for Your glory and the 
greatest good of others, and fill each decision with the guidance of 
Your Spirit.
  My heart is grateful to voice this intercessory prayer on this day in 
our Nation's history with fellow citizens. May You unite our hearts to 
glorify Your name. May You bless the cities and communities of our 
Nation with peace. May You bless the United States of America, for I 
humbly make this prayer in the name of Jesus.
  Amen.
