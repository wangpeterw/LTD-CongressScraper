       AUSTIN, TEXAS, IS THE NUMBER ONE PLACE TO LIVE IN AMERICA

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to 
recognize a city in Texas' 25th Congressional District for being named 
the number one place to live in all of America. That city would be none 
other than our great State's capital, Austin, Texas.
  Cities from all over the Nation are scored based on their job market, 
their value, quality of life, desirability, and net migration. With a 
population of almost 2 million people and an additional 50 new 
residents every single day, Austin is one of the fastest growing 
cities. It is no wonder Austin secured the number one spot.
  In addition to its unleashed economic potential, young families are 
relocating to central Texas for something they can't get anywhere else: 
the ability to experience living in a big city with a booming economy 
that also provides the warmth and friendliness of a small town is what 
makes Austin one of a kind.
  Mom-and-pop shops down the road are able to open their doors, hire 
more Texans, and pay their employees more due to an overhaul of our 
Nation's Tax Code. The truth is Austin is just now seeing the fruits of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am excited to watch Austin continue to 
thrive because of it.
  Texas is the greatest State in America, and Austin is its leadoff 
hitter.
  May God bless Texas. May God bless this great Nation.
