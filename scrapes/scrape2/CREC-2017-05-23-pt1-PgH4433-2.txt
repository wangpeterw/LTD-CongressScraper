                HONORING THE HEROES OF OUR ARMED FORCES

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today ahead of Memorial Day next week 
to honor the heroes of our Armed Forces who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice and service to our Nation and to thank their fellow soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, and marines who were blessed to make it back home to 
their loved ones.
  From the Revolutionary War through the war on terror, more than 1.3 
million Americans have given their lives protecting our freedoms. 
Today, Congress is honoring those lost by passing several bills to help 
protect our surviving veterans and ensure they are treated with the 
dignity and respect they have earned. Our bills will ensure that the VA 
medical centers are meeting compliance requirements, help veterans have 
better access to nursing home care, increase the rates for veterans' 
compensation for service-connected disabilities, and more.
  Mr. Speaker, I can think of no better way to celebrate Memorial Day 
and honor the memory of those lost than by helping our Nation's 
veterans, who have sacrificed so much to help keep America safe. I urge 
all of my colleagues to support these measures today and our veterans 
each and every day.
