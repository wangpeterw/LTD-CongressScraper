                         SANCTIONS LEGISLATION

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last week, the Senate voted on an 
overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to advance the Iran sanctions bill 
currently before us, and we will take another vote today to proceed to 
that bill. I want to thank the chairs and ranking members of the 
Foreign Relations and Banking Committees--Chairman Corker, Chairman 
Crapo--for their efforts to craft additional, much-needed sanctions on 
Russia as well. I would encourage Members of both parties to keep 
working together so we can pass the critical Iran sanctions legislation 
very soon.
