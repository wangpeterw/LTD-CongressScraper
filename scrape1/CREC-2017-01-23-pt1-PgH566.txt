                        SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK 2017

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, at the heart of our American values is the 
belief that each of us, no matter our circumstance, can pursue our own 
success through hard work. That is how a small town boy like me wound 
up a businessman in Augusta and now a Member of Congress.
  The value of education cannot be underestimated on the path to 
achieve the American Dream. That is why I proudly support school 
choice.
  Support for school choice is growing. Evidence shows that 70 percent 
of Americans are in favor.
  A great success story is in Dublin, Georgia, located in my district. 
Parents can choose an elementary school with learning tracks based on a 
student's individual needs and interest. And those tracks continue 
through their childhood education.
  I am very proud to say that Dublin High School has a 96.3 percent 
graduation rate.
  God created every child to be unique, each with special gifts and 
ideas that only he or she may have.
  Families should have the opportunity to select a K-12 education and 
environment that is best suited for their children.
