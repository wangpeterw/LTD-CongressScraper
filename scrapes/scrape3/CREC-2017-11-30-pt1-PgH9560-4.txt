                      HONORING OFFICER JAIMIE COX

  (Mr. KINZINGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Officer 
Jaimie Cox, a fallen hero from my district who was killed in the line 
of duty during a traffic stop on November 5, 2017.
  Jaimie Cox, a Rockford native, served our community and our country 
proudly. After graduating high school, he served in the United States 
Army National Guard. He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2008 and was 
honorably discharged in 2010. He went on to attend Northern Illinois 
University and graduated in 2014.
  For his military service, Cox received the Combat Infantryman Badge, 
Army Achievement Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal. He also won 
the Illinois National Guard Abraham Lincoln Medal of Freedom Ribbon.
  Following college, Cox joined the law enforcement division at the 
Illinois Department of Natural Resources before coming home to serve as 
an officer in the Rockford Police Department.
  Mr. Speaker, Jaimie Cox spent his life dedicated to serving and 
protecting others. On a daily basis, he risked his life to help others 
and he gave the ultimate sacrifice protecting our community.
  On behalf of the 16th Congressional District of Illinois, we honor 
his service, mourn his sacrifice, and pay tribute to our fallen hero, 
Jaimie Cox.
