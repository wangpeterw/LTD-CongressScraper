           REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, this morning, two of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, the Senator from Maine and the Senator from 
Louisiana, introduced a proposal purporting to be a Republican 
alternative to the Affordable Care Act. While I sympathize with my two 
colleagues, whom I respect a great deal and who understand that repeal 
without replace would be devastating for our country, their proposal 
would create chaos, not affordable care for millions of Americans. It 
is much like the vague Executive order issued by the President on 
Friday that my friend, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, called 
``confusing.''
  Their proposal today illustrates the dilemma that both the 
Republicans and the White House are in. It is nearly impossible to keep 
the benefits of the Affordable Care Act without keeping the whole 
thing. There is an easier way out of the pickle our Republican friends 
have created for themselves. Republicans can and should stop repeal 
plans, which are disruptive, and work with Democrats to improve, not 
gut, the Affordable Care Act and health care system for all Americans.
  Thank you. I yield the floor.
