                      HONORING COLONEL BYRON DEEL

  (Mr. DesJARLAIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DesJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Colonel Byron Deel, 
Chief of the Joint Staff, Tennessee National Guard, who will be 
retiring this week after 32 years of dedicated service.

  Throughout his career, Byron has held numerous leadership roles with 
a wide range of responsibilities. Whether it be his command of the 
Joint Counterdrug Task Force or his current position as Chief of the 
Joint Staff, Byron has exemplified a work ethic and a regard for others 
that is second to none.
  Colonel Deel's career includes two deployments: in 2001 to Bosnia and 
in 2005 to Afghanistan. His exemplary service is reflected in the 
numerous commendations he has received, including the Bronze Star and 
the Tennessee National Guard Distinguished Service Medal, among a long 
list of many others. It is also important to mention that his wife, 
Mary Deel, whom Byron introduces as the ``better deal,'' serves in the 
National Guard as the Education Services Officer.
  On a personal note, Byron has been an invaluable resource for me and 
my staff on issues that impact our guardsmen. While I am sorry that 
Tennessee is losing an officer of such high caliber, I extend a 
heartfelt thanks for his outstanding service and wish him the very best 
in his retirement.
