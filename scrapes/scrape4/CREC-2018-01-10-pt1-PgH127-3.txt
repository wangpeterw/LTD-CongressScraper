               DREAMERS DREAM OF THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, a little clarity I think is very 
important on a very, very important issue.
  I would like to call 140,000 young people in my State DREAMers 
because they dream of the greatness of America. The status that they 
are under is something called DACA, which was instituted by President 
Barack Obama because this Republican Congress could not provide 
legislative relief, so he saw the lives that were being impacted. In a 
few months, however, the present President, who feigns not knowing what 
happened, was the individual who removed that DACA status.
  So let me be very clear: it is a dire situation, and the reason is 
because there are individuals whose status is now expiring or has 
already expired, therefore, they are living in limbo. These are 
doctors, lawyers, teachers, and young people with families.
  It is crucial that we move quickly for a DACA fix, and we do it 
without impacting family reunification or diversity visas. We do it out 
of humanity, caring, and respect. Let's do it now. Let's do it for 
America.
