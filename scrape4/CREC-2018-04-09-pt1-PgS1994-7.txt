                        REMEMBERING DANNY AKAKA

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over the past weeks, as we have been 
away, we have heard of the passing of two of our Senators: Zell Miller 
and Danny Akaka.
  I would like to say a few words about Danny Akaka, who was a good 
friend of mine. In everything he did, he was a soldier, a teacher, and 
a statesman. He embodied the spirit of Hawaii. He was so sincere in his 
beliefs and such a kind and gentle man that Senators went out of their 
way to help him and, of course, he fought so hard for his State. He 
taught us so much in his modesty, in his persistence, and in his love 
of his constituents.
  So for all he taught us, for his service and for his friendship, we 
say ``mahalo'' one final time.
