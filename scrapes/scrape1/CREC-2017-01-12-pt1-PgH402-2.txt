     CONGRATULATING BISHOP O'DOWD AND McCLYMONDS ONFOOTBALL STATE 
                             CHAMPIONSHIPS

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me first say how happy I am today to 
acknowledge the extraordinary accomplishments of two highschool 
football teams in my beautiful congressional district. Until now, 
Oakland, California, never held a State championship,but now we have 
two. On December 17, Bishop O'Dowd clinched the CIF State Division 5-AA 
Championship. They beat Valley ViewHigh School 43-24, with former 
Oakland Raiders running back Coach Napoleon Kaufman leading them to 
victory. The same day,McClymonds' Warriors claimed the CIF State 5-A 
Championship with a 20-17 victory, becoming the first Oakland Athletic 
Leagueteam to win a State championship.
  McClymonds is a public historic high school in the West Oakland 
community of my district. Coach Michael Peters has coachedMcClymonds 
since 1992 and has shown his commitment over the years to ensuring his 
athletes succeed both on the field and in theclassroom.
  Bishop O'Dowd, a Catholic high school, has been an athletic force for 
years, and I am so proud of their team. They haveachieved the historic 
accomplishment of their championship also.
  These young athletes have embodied the spirit, the passion, and the 
sportsmanship of Oakland and the entire East Bay. Pleasejoin me in 
congratulating them on these championships.
