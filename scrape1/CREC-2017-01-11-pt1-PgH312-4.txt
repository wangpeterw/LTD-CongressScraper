                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  As a parent encourages a child or a mentor calls forth the hidden 
potential of an intern, Lord our God, may You bless allwho work as the 
115th Congress convenes, especially those new Members.
  Remove fear and confusion, wipe away distrust, which only inhibit 
good judgment and leadership. Strengthen the resolve andcompassion of 
all Members, that they may serve Your people with renewed clarity of 
vision and refined purpose that will soonunify this Nation in self-
discipline and confidence.
  For You reward the just and their deeds.
  Bless all Members this day, O God, and be with them and with us all 
in every day to come. May all that is done be for Yourgreater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
