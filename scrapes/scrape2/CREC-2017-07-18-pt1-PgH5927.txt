                        NEGATIVE IMPACT OF MEDIA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a new survey by the Pew Research 
Center found that an astounding two-thirds of Americans say the news 
media has a negative impact on our Nation. What a comment on the media.
  The survey asked participants whether a variety of institutions are 
having a positive or negative effect on the way things are going in 
this country today. The rating the media received was the lowest of all 
institutions.
  Another public opinion poll by Gallup showed the media's credibility 
has reached a record low. This is not much of a surprise, given the 
media's constant barrage of personal attacks and negative news 
coverage. The American people deserve better than a biased media.
  For the sake of our country, our democracy, and the credibility of 
the media itself, let's hope they report the news more fairly and 
objectively in the future.
