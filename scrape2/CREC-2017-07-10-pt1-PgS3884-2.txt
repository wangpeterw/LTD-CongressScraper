              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SISSETON, SOUTH DAKOTA

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Sisseton, 
SD. The town of Sisseton will be celebrating its quasquicentennial on 
June 14 through 16, 2017. Sisseton will host quasquicentennial events, 
which include food and craft vendors, various exhibits, entertainment, 
parades, athletic competitions, a veterans museum display, Native 
American flute music, a rodeo, and much more.
  Sisseton is located on the northern edge of the Coteau des Prairies 
in Roberts County. The Sisseton area has long been known as a community 
enriched with Native American and immigrant history. It is home to more 
than 2,450 people and almost 200 businesses with many unique cultural 
and recreational opportunities. Since its founding 125 years ago, the 
community of Sisseton continues to serve as a strong example of South 
Dakota values and traditions.
  I offer my congratulations to the citizens of Sisseton on their 
quasquicentennial celebration and wish them continued prosperity in the 
years to come.
