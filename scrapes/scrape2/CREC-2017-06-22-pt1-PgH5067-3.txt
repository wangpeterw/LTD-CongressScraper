Krishnamoorthi) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.


                             General Leave

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2353.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.
  Mr. Speaker, for years, Americans have urged Congress to work 
together and advance policies that promote good-paying jobs. We have 
heard the voices of those struggling to find the opportunities they 
need. They have been frustrated that the economy has taken so long to 
recover. Many feel stuck in a job market that has transformed 
dramatically due to advances in technology and an increasingly 
competitive global economy.
  It is time to deliver the results hardworking men and women 
desperately need and restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. That 
is exactly why we are here today.
  This legislation is about jobs. I, along with my colleague 
Representative Krishnamoorthi, introduced H.R. 2353 to help prepare 
more Americans to succeed in the workforce by improving career and 
technical education.
  Today, far too many Americans lack the skills and education they need 
to build a promising career, and many jobs are going unfilled as 
employers face a shortage of skilled workers.
  Paul Tomczuk, president of R. H. Marcon and a constituent of mine, 
said: ``Workforce development is one of the most pressing challenges 
facing roofing contractors today.'' This is a problem we cannot afford 
to ignore.
  As co-chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, I have 
worked hard to address this challenge by enhancing awareness of how CTE 
programs can lift people out of poverty and expand opportunity.
  Too often, it is suggested that, in order to be successful in life, 
you have to get a bachelor's degree, but that is not the reality of 
today's diverse economy. In fact, I have met people who have gone into 
debt from attending a 4-year college or university only to enroll in a 
CTE program after graduation to get that good-paying job.
  Attending a more traditional college or university simply isn't the 
right fit for everyone. There are countless individuals who learn best 
in innovative, work-based programming where they can acquire hands-on 
experience aimed at a certain career.
  CTE programs are preparing students for the jobs of the future, 
including in technology, engineering, healthcare, agriculture, and 
more. However, there is more that can be done to ensure these programs 
are successful.
  The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century 
Act will rein in the Federal Government's role in CTE and empower State 
and local leaders to tailor programs to meet the unique needs of the 
students in their communities. It will give students and parents the 
tools they need to hold programs accountable.
  Most importantly, this legislation encourages local education leaders 
to collaborate with local employers and improves alignment with CTE 
programs and in-demand jobs. This legislation is a win for American 
workers.
  By working together, we have developed a set of bipartisan reforms 
that will help address our Nation's skills gap, break the cycle of 
poverty, and help more individuals climb the ladder of opportunity.
  I want to thank Representative Krishnamoorthi and our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for all the work that went into moving H.R. 
2353 forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan 
legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2353. H.R. 2353 is a 
bill introduced by my good friend Congressman Thompson and myself to 
modernize and take career and technical education into the 21st 
century.
  A persistent complaint I hear from employers throughout the State of 
Illinois is that CTE programs have not kept pace with the changing 
demands of industry. This bill would address the skills gap by aligning 
CTE programs to meet the needs of the labor market, giving stakeholders 
more autonomy in developing curricula, while ensuring robust 
accountability standards. I hope everybody will support passage of H.R. 
2353.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the distinguished 
chairwoman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, who has 
had a commitment to skills-based education for many years.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Thompson, for his 
leadership on this issue. As he said, I have been a strong supporter of 
this for a long, long time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2353, the 
Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.
  Mr. Speaker, when many Americans think of higher education, they 
think of a traditional college or university on a sprawling green 
campus. They think of students leaving colleges and universities with 
their degree in hand, ready for a career and set for life.
  While many Americans choose this path, there is a misconception that 
this is the only pathway to success. For many hardworking Americans, 
the pathway to success does not require a baccalaureate degree. In 
fact, skills-focused education has helped countless Americans gain the 
specialized knowledge and skills they need to enter the workforce and 
build fulfilling lives.
  So many men and women have found success through workforce 
development programs, however, we have come

[[Page H5077]]

to a critical juncture with the future of these programs, and our 
educational institutions have not caught up. As a result, American 
businesses, large and small, are having a hard time finding enough 
workers with the skills and talent they need.
  Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical 
Education for the 21st Century Act, which unanimously passed the House 
Committee on Education and the Workforce, provides critical reforms to 
our Nation's education programs and prepares students to compete in our 
competitive global economy.
  Mr. Speaker, all education is truly career education, and we must 
give our students every opportunity to attain the skills they need to 
succeed. When students, parents, employers, and, yes, lawmakers 
understand that, we will be on the right track to closing the skills 
gap that exists in our country.
  I want to thank my colleagues, especially Representative Thompson, 
for his leadership on this issue. As the co-chair of the CTE Caucus, he 
has spent years championing this issue.
  I also want to thank Ranking Member Scott and Representative 
Krishnamoorthi, as well as all committee members, for the bipartisan 
work that is reflected in this bill.
  Expanding opportunity through CTE is vital to closing the Nation's 
skills gap, ending the cycle of poverty, and creating a better tomorrow 
for hardworking Americans.
  I urge all Members to support H.R. 2353.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on 
Education and the Workforce, someone who has dedicated his career, in 
part, to this issue.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Illinois for his leadership on this legislation.
  I rise in support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which will reauthorize 
the Perkins Career and Technical Education program. H.R. 2353 builds on 
the House's bipartisan efforts in the last Congress, when this Chamber 
passed CTE reauthorization by a vote of 405-5.
  The research is clear: The United States workforce is suffering a 
skills gap. According to Georgetown University Center on Education and 
the Workforce, by 2020, 65 percent of all jobs in the United States 
will require at least some postsecondary education or skills 
acquisition. Yet, if the current trend holds, by 2020, our Nation will 
have more than 5 million fewer skilled workers than necessary to fill 
the high-skilled jobs which will be available. In Virginia alone, that 
is 30,000 open jobs; 17,000 are in the area of cybersecurity, and those 
jobs have salaries starting at $88,000.
  This bipartisan, comprehensive reauthorization will improve program 
quality and services for students most in need of skills. It will also 
update the Federal investment in CTE to provide increased State and 
local flexibility, while ensuring greater accountability for program 
quality.
  It ensures that there remains in place a Federal focus on equity of 
opportunity and the role of the U.S. Department of Education to protect 
and promote the civil rights of all students and compliance with 
Federal laws.
  The bill also strengthens the Federal commitment to support delivery 
of high-quality CTE programs by retaining the Department of Education's 
full authority to approve or disapprove State and local plans.
  The bill also requires Federal oversight, monitoring, and technical 
assistance to support program improvement and maintains full authority 
of the Secretary to enforce compliance with statutory program 
requirements and Federal civil rights laws.
  I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Krishnamoorthi) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 
their bipartisan leadership, and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
Langevin) for his leadership as the chair of the CTE Caucus and for his 
dedication to realizing a comprehensive program reauthorization.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 
30 seconds.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this bill was unanimously 
reported by the committee. It has nearly unanimous support from 
business groups, educators, and community stakeholders, so I urge my 
colleagues to support the bill.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne), the subcommittee chairman for the 
Workforce Protections Subcommittee of the Education and the Workforce 
Committee.
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time, and 
I am proud to rise in support of this strong, bipartisan legislation.
  Improving career and technical education programs is the most 
important thing Congress can do to help close the skills gap, combat 
poverty, and help put Americans back to work.
  Studies clearly show that there are unfilled high-wage jobs out there 
that remain open because people lack the skills to fill the jobs. That 
is where CTE comes in.
  When I was chancellor of Alabama's 2-year college system, I saw 
firsthand just how impressive these programs are. They really do work 
like magic by taking an untrained worker and giving him the skills he 
needs to fill an in-demand job. It is a win-win for everyone.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and supporter 
of this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this reform-oriented bill that helps build the 21st century workforce.

                              {time}  1400

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the chair of the CTE Caucus.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical Education 
Caucus, I rise in strong support of the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bipartisan bill, Mr. 
Speaker, is long overdue. The Carl D. Perkins CTE Act, the primary 
Federal investment in CTE, has not been reauthorized in over a decade.
  I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking 
Member Scott, Representative Thompson, and Representative 
Krishnamoorthi for their leadership and collaboration on this important 
bill, and a particular thanks to my co-chair of the CTE Caucus, Mr. 
Thompson, for his outstanding leadership and partnership on this issue 
over the years.
  Mr. Speaker, CTE provides students of all ages with the skills they 
need to succeed in high-demand, high-paying, high-skilled jobs. At a 
time right now when hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, IT, 
and other skilled trades remain unfilled, Congress has a responsibility 
to empower workers with appropriate education and training. If we fail 
to modernize and invest in CTE, we will be unable to build a skilled 
workforce, and American businesses will pay the price.
  H.R. 2353 aligns CTE programs with industry needs, promotes work-
based learning, and supports career counselors.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman 
has expired.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from Rhode Island.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. H.R. 2353 aligns CTE programs with industry needs, 
promotes work-based learning, and supports career counselors while 
strengthening Federal investment in CTE.
  I encourage my colleagues to support students, businesses, and their 
local economies by supporting this bill.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the chairman of the Education 
and the Workforce Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and 
Pensions.
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sponsoring this 
legislation.
  I rise today to voice my strong support for the Strengthening Career 
and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, H.R. 2353. In today's 
economy, we know that not everyone follows the same path into the 
workforce. Whether a student wants to pursue a

[[Page H5078]]

job in the auto industry, healthcare, energy, or IT, the reforms we are 
advancing will help aspiring workers get the hands-on experience they 
need to thrive in the 21st century workforce.
  This bill is particularly important for my home State of Michigan, 
the heartland of American manufacturing, where high-skilled jobs are a 
vital component of our State's economy. I am also glad it includes my 
bipartisan provisions to address outdated and burdensome occupational 
licensing requirements.
  As I meet with educators, workers, and manufacturers across my 
district, I consistently hear about the need to improve CTE programs 
and close the skills gap. Let's pass this bipartisan bill and help more 
men and women in Michigan and across the country secure fulfilling and 
good-paying jobs.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Illinois for his leadership on this bill; and also to Congressman 
Thompson for all he has done to bring this to where it is today, 
because millions of students and workers are eager to advance into 
good-paying, high-skilled technical careers.
  From childcare to manufacturing, to carpentry or computer science, 
jobs that require technical training are in high demand, and we want to 
make sure that students across the country have the skills they need to 
get hired and develop their careers.
  With this bill, we will help strengthen the Perkins career and 
technical education program that reaches over 11 million students every 
year. This bill will help policymakers measure what does and does not 
work in career and technical education, allowing us to build on past 
successes. It will ensure our CTE programs are aligned with the needs 
of high-demand growth industries to make sure that America is 
competitive globally, and it will support work-based learning and 
apprenticeships, and our early education and childcare workforce.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. This will bring the Perkins program into 
the modern, 21st century global economy. This has broad bipartisan 
support.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this act, and I urge them to 
fully fund the CTE programs and reject the proposed cuts of $168 
million.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), a member of the Education 
and the Workforce Committee.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Glenn 
Thompson for yielding. I appreciate his effective leadership on 
strengthening America's workforce to create jobs.
  I am grateful to speak today on the importance of career and 
technical education, a critical tool in closing the skills gap and 
creating jobs.
  South Carolina has been successful in promoting career and technical 
education programs, recruiting Michelin, BMW, Boeing, Bridgestone, MTU, 
and now Volvo. I hope all communities across America can experience the 
success we have achieved creating jobs, leading to the lowest 
unemployment rate in 16 years.
  The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century 
Act will reduce regulations and allow State and local leaders to create 
CTE programs that are best for their communities by providing greater 
flexibility of Federal resources, allowing States to respond to their 
unique educational and economic needs to create jobs for fulfilling 
lives.
  I appreciate the opportunity to encourage my colleagues to pass this 
bipartisan legislation. These efforts, amplified by President Donald 
Trump's executive order last week expanding apprenticeship programs, 
will be an important step forward in our educational system--closing 
the skills gap and training Americans for meaningful, skilled jobs.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).
  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of the Carl D. 
Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.
  I would be remiss if I didn't compliment my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle and all of their respective staffs who have worked so hard 
to bring this really good, strong bipartisan measure here before the 
Congress for the benefit of the American people.
  I have got to tell you: everywhere I go back in Minnesota and around 
the country, I hear two things when I am talking to businesspeople. And 
they say, you know, the people who are trained under this career and 
technical education program are the best employees that we have. The 
other thing I hear is that we need more of them.
  So, again, thanks to my colleagues for bringing this bill forward. 
There are some good, new provisions in it that gives States an 
opportunity to focus better on what the needs are in their particular 
region. There are some other tools to help communities, the program 
itself, and the businesses to form partnerships to expand the program.
  At the end of the day, it is all about creating good, strong jobs 
with living wages and strong futures. It is about creating 
opportunities for the working men and women in this country and for the 
businesses that are at the heart of our economy. And is it about 
creating a dynamic economy where people can grow and prosper in the 
21st century.
  It is a good bill for workers. It is a good bill for business. It is 
a good bill for our economy. And it is a good bill for our national 
security.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption in the strongest language possible.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, may I ask my colleague from North Carolina, 
the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, to engage 
in a brief colloquy.
  Mr. Speaker, Wyoming has used CTE funds to pioneer innovative ways of 
improving the college and career readiness of our students.
  Protecting CTE funding in Wyoming for cutting-edge programs like the 
Pathway Innovation Center in Casper is crucial, in part, because the 
previous administration's harmful energy policies that devastated our 
economy, and we must now work to address a depressed labor market and 
hedge against future energy market downturns.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the chairwoman and her committee 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to reform and 
reauthorize the CTE programs. However, I have concerns that the bill, 
as drafted in its current form, could negatively impact my State. 
Therefore, I can't support it.
  Additionally, I know some Members from West Virginia and Louisiana 
share my concerns.
  Therefore, I ask the gentlewoman, would she be willing to work with 
us as this process moves forward to help address these concerns so we 
can get a bill to the President's desk that we can all support?
  Ms. FOXX. Will the gentlewoman yield?
  Ms. CHENEY. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for sharing her 
perspective, and I look forward to working to address her concerns as 
we move forward in the legislative process.
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support on reauthorizing 
the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which really 
should be just called the JOBS Act. As we have heard from Members all 
across the country, Members are hearing the same thing from their 
employer community, which is jobs exist, but skills don't.
  What this bill does is it connects people to that job market in 
response to the fact that the 21st century market is dynamic and 
changing, and this bill really gets it in terms of getting to that 
point.
  In May, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that there are 5.9 
million job openings in the U.S. economy; a record high since they even 
started collecting that data. So our job as Members of Congress is to 
update the law and update these programs to align

[[Page H5079]]

it with the Workforce Investment Act, which was passed in 2014, and the 
Every Student Succeeds Act, which was passed again in the last 
Congress.
  This will be the final piece of the puzzle, which will, again, make 
sure that millions of Americans will have the opportunity to have good-
paying jobs that they can support themselves and their families. In 
sector after sector, whether it is IT, whether it is healthcare, 
whether it is advanced manufacturing, all are going to benefit from 
this measure.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate both of the sponsors for their great work 
on this, and I urge all Members to support it.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2353. This bill 
will reform our career and technical education system, and strengthen 
the programs in my district in Pennsylvania.
  Mr. Speaker, there are jobs available in my district right now, but 
there aren't enough trained workers. This bill will help businesses and 
schools partner to prepare students for jobs in today's in-demand 
industries.
  We need to accommodate the needs of many different types of students 
like Steve Nunemaker from Ephrata, Pennsylvania, who, at the age of 47, 
graduated from Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology with a degree in 
engineering computer-aided drafting.
  CTE programs are vital to training workers for new careers. The jobs 
that are available are good, family-sustaining jobs. So many people in 
this country are ready to learn and eager to work.
  I would like to thank again Representatives Thompson and 
Krishnamoorthi for their leadership, and I rise to urge my colleagues 
to support this bill.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. Polis), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on 
Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2353, the 
Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.
  I recently had the opportunity to visit our new Pathways in 
Technology Early College, or P-TECH, program at Skyline High School in 
Colorado.
  P-TECH is a partnership between the St. Vrain Valley School District, 
Front Range Community College, and IBM. It allows students to earn a 
high school diploma and an associate's degree in 5 or 6 years through 
dual enrollment.
  I spoke with a number of students participating in P-TECH and they 
shared with me how the program equips them with the skills they need to 
get a well-paying, reliable job after graduation. That is exactly the 
kind of innovation Congress should be supporting, and I am proud that 
the Perkins reauthorization bill does just that.
  I urge this bill's final passage in the House, and I call on my 
colleagues in the Senate to take up this bipartisan legislation as soon 
as possible so more students can enjoy the kinds of opportunities that 
the students at the P-TECH High School and St. Vrain Valley School 
District do.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), a member of the House Education 
and the Workforce Committee.
  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2353.
  Not only does this legislation authorize more available funding for 
CTE programs, it also gives States more freedom to support CTE 
activities in rural districts like mine.

                              {time}  1415

  This bill also gives authority back to the States to approve CTE 
plans rather than require Federal approval.
  In the short time I have been in Congress, I have seen firsthand the 
unique differences across each of our States and districts. Increasing 
flexibility will enable States to have the flexibility to create and 
support programs that fit their unique workforce needs.
  I am excited to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and look 
forward to its passage later today. Helping our young people transition 
from school into meaningful careers is one of the best ways we can move 
our Nation into a vibrant 21st century economy.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. Wilson).
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am a strong supporter of career 
and technical education. While this bipartisan bill makes needed 
improvements to current law, during the committee markup I offered and 
later withdrew an amendment to provide more Federal support for skill 
development and training programs for ex-offenders who need a second 
chance and opportunity.
  Ex-offenders, who are disproportionately young men of color due to 
the bias in the criminal justice system, face numerous hurdles when 
they try to reintegrate into society after serving their time. Finding 
a decent job is a necessary first step towards developing self-esteem 
and self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, and too often, a prior criminal 
history is a barrier to ex-offenders seeking employment.
  I withdrew my amendment because of the important work. Nevertheless, 
it is my view that my amendment should be considered as this bill 
advances to future conference consideration. Let's help stop recidivism 
for this special population.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), who is a member of 
the Education and the Workforce Committee.
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
yielding time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career 
and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.
  Last week, President Trump laid out a plan to expand educational 
opportunities for American workers. President Trump's dedication to 
workforce development is admirable, and I am glad we have a President 
who has made this a priority.
  As someone who has worked in the construction industry for my entire 
career, I know firsthand how difficult it can be to find skilled 
workers. In fact, I spoke at the Associated Builders and Contractors 
breakfast this morning, and they reported that there will be over 1 
million job openings in the construction industry in the next few 
years.
  I have met with many industries in my district. The workforce is 
aging. There aren't enough people who currently have the skills to take 
over, and it can take nearly 2 years for people to be fully trained for 
these positions.
  First and foremost, it is our responsibility to make sure that young 
people today are equipped for the job market of tomorrow. Getting an 
education is essential, but it is equally important that our education 
efforts are aligned with the in-demand jobs in our communities.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
Georgia an additional 15 seconds.
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this bill will bridge the gap between the 
business community and education, which is critical to prepare 
America's future workforce.
  I am happy to cosponsor this important bill, and I hope that my 
colleagues will join me in voting for H.R. 2353.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), who is the vice ranking member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, the Strengthening Career and Technical 
Education for the 21st Century Act is an important step in educating 
students and preparing them for the workforce. It increases 
opportunities for historically underserved students. It strengthens 
alignment between CTE programs and stakeholders. It includes the 
amendment I worked on with Representative Stefanik to encourage CTE 
programs to integrate arts and design skills.
  This bill will support more programs that respond to local workforce 
demands and teach advanced skills and creative thinking, like the one I 
just visited at Portland Community College. Employers, including Intel, 
support the school's new STEAM Lab,

[[Page H5080]]

where students are pursuing certificates and degrees in fields like 
microelectronics technology.
  The Federal Government does have an important enforcement role, and I 
am disappointed that the bill weakens the Department of Education's 
ability to hold States accountable for improving low-quality CTE 
programs. But despite that concern, this bill is worthy of support.
  I thank Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, Representative 
Thompson, and Representative Krishnamoorthi for their bipartisan work, 
and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis), an Education and the Workforce 
Committee member.
  Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for his 
leadership and hard work on this important legislation.
  Too often, students across the country leave school without the 
necessary skills to compete in the modern economy. As the cost of a 4-
year degree continues to soar higher and higher and students are taking 
on greater debt, employers across this country are struggling to find 
skilled workers to fill good, high-paying jobs. Career and technical 
education bridges the gap between the classroom and the workplace, 
offering students a clear pathway to a meaningful career.

  I am pleased this legislation includes my amendment supporting dual 
and concurrent enrollment. By allowing high school students to begin 
earning postsecondary credit, dual enrollment can shorten the time to 
degree or credential completion, puts students on the fast tack to a 
good job, and saves families a significant amount of money. Students 
who participate in dual enrollment are more likely to continue and 
pursue postsecondary education, less likely to need remediation, and 
more likely to complete a degree.
  My district is lucky to be home to a great technical college that 
does its job. For example, in Rosemount, Minnesota, Dakota County 
Technical College partners with local employers to provide students 
customized training that fits employer-specific needs.
  I am proud to support this important legislation that will increase 
opportunity and prepare students with the skills to succeed.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois has 8\3/4\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Since coming to Congress, I have visited with business leaders across 
my district, such as Cindy, the plant manager at Train in Charlotte, 
and educators at local colleges like Central Piedmont Community 
College. Each stressed the importance of educating our workforce to 
fill existing available jobs and to train for jobs of the future.
  We must close the skills gap through innovation and work-based 
learning opportunities such as those provided through the Strengthening 
Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.
  CTE improves collaboration between secondary and postsecondary 
schools, employers, industry, and community partners, giving students, 
regardless of their background, access to quality job training and the 
opportunity to earn well-paying jobs without having to complete a 4-
year degree. This training is critical to closing the opportunity gap 
that exists in communities like mine in Mecklenburg County.
  IBM, which employs more than 1,300 people in the 12th District, wrote 
to me just last week to remind us that jobs in growing technology 
fields demand candidates with high-tech skills that don't always 
require a traditional degree.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in reauthorizing CTE to 
continue modernizing today's workforce training and securing America's 
future.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, one good thing about voting for this bill 
is the rhetoric we are hearing from this Chamber today. It sounds like 
the drumbeat from high school guidance counselors, college recruiters, 
and politicians kowtowing to the education lobby that everybody has to 
go to a 4-year college or that it is even wise for people to go to a 4-
year college is beginning to come to an end.
  I am glad, under this bill, we are going to make it easier for 
students to get a degree focused on skills. For some, that degree could 
be 1 year; for some, it could be 2 years. Frequently, these degrees 
lead to jobs that are higher paying than many jobs that you get after 
you have a 4-year degree.
  Not only are they higher paying, but I think they result in more job 
security because you are not a generalist who will get laid off when 
you are 45 or 50 and not find a job. But if you have a skill, that 
skill is something in which you can still get a job when you are 50, 
55, 60, or 65. Therefore, I am proud to announce for this bill today.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my friend from 
Illinois and also my friend Mr. Thompson for this bipartisan bill. I am 
happy to support it and hear all of my colleagues enthusiastically 
support it.
  Career and technical education gives students the opportunity to get 
technical experience regardless of whether their next step out of high 
school is to immediately join the workforce or to go to college.
  In my district, I have had the opportunity to visit many students in 
programs that benefit from the inclusions of career pathways in their 
high school curriculum. Mt. Diablo High School students, for example, 
create a farm-to-table restaurant experience, while Pittsburg High 
Schoolers design computer animations as a part of the school's Green 
Engineering Academy. At De Anza High School in Richmond, California, 
they run an Information Technology Academy focusing on IT career 
skills, while providing their community IT services free of charge.
  By enacting this bipartisan legislation, Congress will affirmatively 
take steps to update our Nation's educational vision and will propel 
today's students into tomorrow's workforce.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat), who is a member of the Education 
and the Workforce Committee.
  Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.
  The economy is not growing as it should be--about 0.7 percent last 
quarter--and according to many of the employers in my district, our 
workforce is not prepared to meet the needs of today, let alone the 
future.
  This legislation is important because it recognizes that we need an 
education system that best prepares our kids for the future--a future 
in business--as soon as they hit K-12, and they should be ready to 
enter the job market or move on to additional training. Traditional 4-
year colleges and universities cannot be the only pathway for the next 
generation of students.
  In Virginia, there were nearly 110,000 postsecondary students 
enrolled in CTE courses in the 2014 year. Programs I am privileged to 
represent in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District include Amelia 
Nottoway Technical Center, the Chesterfield Governor's Career and 
Technical Academy, and Chesterfield County Public Schools Governor's 
Health Sciences Academy.
  While these innovative programs in my district have excelled, 
technical skills and on-the-job training must be ingrained in the 
thinking of our entire K-12 educational system, across the curriculum, 
in every class. I believe this bill is a positive step in that 
direction.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).
  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois for 
yielding me the time.
  Certainly, we are in the House today and sending a very clear message 
that career and technical skills matter, and I rise in support of this 
bill. For a 4-year college, that pathway is certainly

[[Page H5081]]

great for some, but not all. Technical training helped shape my life 
from community college to the construction site and, yes, here to 
Congress.
  Career and technical education, or CTE, is often overlooked, and it 
shouldn't be. We need electricians and computer programmers just as 
much as we need doctors and engineers. In my State of New Jersey, 9 out 
of 10 of the fastest growing occupations don't require a 4-year degree, 
but they do require a certificate or on-the-job training.
  This is an important reauthorization bill that will go a long way to 
providing students with opportunities to build skills that they need 
for those fast-growing, high-paying jobs.
  I want to thank the sponsors for including my provision that will 
allow high schools to give more information on that career path in 
technical education.
  Don Borden, who is the president of Camden County College in my 
State, says that we have an ``understanding of the types of educational 
programs we need to provide for our students,'' and that ``will lead to 
meaningful employment.''
  This is about employment and careers, to train the students on 
available curriculum, on available jobs. I urge support of this jobs 
bill.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).
  Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st 
Century Act.
  I urge all Members to vote for this bipartisan bill that allows our 
educational institutions the ability to better adapt their programs to 
the specific needs of their students. This bill will give States and 
localities more flexibility in how to use Federal money for career and 
technical education programs, which will ultimately help Americans find 
the jobs they need.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester.
  Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening 
Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This important 
legislation would allow more Americans to enter the workforce with the 
skills needed to compete for high-skilled, in-demand jobs.
  Delaware employers tell me they need a skilled workforce. CTE support 
is a vital tool in addressing the skills gap in many industries in our 
country. Our support ensures that all students have access to high-
quality CTE programs. It allows States to strengthen these programs, 
providing hands-on learning opportunities that lead to higher 
graduation rates as well as better postsecondary and career options.
  In 2012, Delaware started Pathways to Prosperity to give high school 
students an industry-recognized certificate, college credits, and 
relevant work experience, all before they graduate. In 2 years, it has 
grown from 30 students to over 6,000 students, who are now better 
suited to determine their next steps and build a career.
  I thank Mr. Thompson and also Mr. Krishnamoorthi for their 
leadership, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan 
legislation.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman from Pennsylvania 
for yielding.
  As a former manufacturer, I have experienced firsthand the importance 
of career technical education in promoting meaningful work. It is 
especially helpful for helping people transition from a social safety 
net or a second-chance program, but I have seen it firsthand. For high 
school students and for adults who change careers, it can truly change 
lives.
  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I am confident 
it can do for our country what it has done in the Eighth District of 
Ohio.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).
  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for 
his great work on this bill that would reauthorize a program that is 
critical to both American workers and businesses, and the future of our 
American economy.
  I am continuously hearing from family-owned manufactures across my 
district, such as Atlas Tool and Die and ODM, that they cannot find 
workers with the skills they need to fill good-paying jobs. I hear this 
from companies also like Boeing, Intel, and Abbott. At the same time, 
millions of Americans are struggling to find jobs, but they don't have 
the skills that they need.
  This bill addresses this problem by supporting career and technical 
education programs that are matched to regional, State, and local labor 
markets. These applied science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics, or STEM education programs, are an important component of 
the innovation engine that drives our economy.
  As we work to move innovative technologies into the marketplace, we 
need a skilled workforce to build and implement them. We also need to 
make sure that our innovation economy benefits all Americans, 
especially the middle class.
  I thank my colleagues for this bill and urge all my colleagues to 
support it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. LIPINSKI. I want to thank Mr. Krishnamoorthi for all his work on 
this bill, and I thank the Republicans for their work. It is a good, 
bipartisan bill. It is something that America needs to help strengthen 
our economy and help strengthen America's middle class.
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  I would like to thank my staff and committee staff for all their work 
on this bill. I especially want to thank Alex Payne, the lead committee 
staffer on career and technical education from our side, who, 
unfortunately, couldn't be here with us today, due to the death of his 
father. I want to thank Congressman Thompson for his incredible 
leadership on this bill for all these years.
  I also want to say that the main purpose of this bill is to 
coordinate what is taught in CTE classes with workforce demands. H.R. 
2353 requires State plans to show how CTE curricula aligns with in-
demand careers. School districts must consult business leaders, 
educators, parents, community leaders, representatives of special 
populations, and others to determine the most promising career fields. 
This bipartisan bill gives everyone a seat at the table and makes sure 
no one is left behind.
  I also want to thank Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott for 
their incredible leadership on this bill.
  I want to take note of the fact that this is a bipartisan bill, at a 
time when bipartisanship is so needed in this town. I urge the Senate 
to take up our bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2353 has the power to improve the lives of 
countless Americans. By modernizing career and technical education, we 
can help prepare more men and women from all walks of life to succeed 
in the workforce.
  I would like to note that it is important we continue to fund these 
programs at the authorized levels so the programs can adequately serve 
students of all ages. We really have an opportunity to make a positive 
difference today, and I couldn't be prouder of the bipartisan work that 
went into this.
  Once again, I want to thank Representative Krishnamoorthi as well as 
all the members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 
I would be remiss not to thank my education staff on my team, Katie 
Brown; Education and the Workforce staffers, James Redstone and Alex 
Payne; and all of our colleagues, for their diligent work on this 
important piece of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 2353, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, the Strengthening Career and Technical 
Education for the 21st Century Act is a long overdue reform and

[[Page H5082]]

reauthorization of the federal career and technical education (CTE) 
program. Unfortunately, I remain concerned that the bill included 
changes to the funding formula for states that would result in 
significant cuts to CTE funding for West Virginia and several other 
states beginning in 2021.
  The removal of a hold harmless provision will result in a direct loss 
of $4.07 million to West Virginia, a cut of nearly 20 percent over a 
three-year period. Given West Virginia's economic struggles in recent 
years, we can ill afford drastic cuts to workforce training programs. 
As the legislative process continues, I urge the U.S. Senate to find an 
equitable solution and consider states that will be disadvantaged by 
the removal of the hold harmless provision.
  Without additional changes to the funding formula, in its current 
form I will oppose the bill.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2353, 
the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century 
Act.
  High school, community college, and trade school students in Houston 
and Harris County, Texas deserve the opportunity to receive a high-
quality career and technical education (CTE). CTE education is the 
pathway for many in our community and throughout our great country to a 
good paying job and the middle class.
  High-quality CTE programs are critical for our nation's economy. 
Nearly every sector of our economy, from refiners and shipbuilders 
along the Houston Ship Channel to medical device manufacturers and 
information technology firms, rely on skilled STEM-educated workers to 
innovate and compete in the global marketplace.
  For over thirty years, the federal government has provided direct 
support to CTE programs nationwide through the Perkins Career and 
Technical Education Act. Congress has not successfully reauthorized the 
Perkins Act in 11 years, delaying the needed reforms and additional 
resources our CTE students deserve.
  Today's legislation delivers the reforms and resources that will help 
improve our local career and technical education programs. The 
Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act 
will provide states more flexibility in the use of federal resources in 
response to changes in education and the economy and reduce 
administrative burdens and simplify the process for states to apply for 
federal resources. This legislation will increase federal investment in 
CTE program by nine percent over the life of the authorization and 
reward success and innovation in CTE program practices that have been 
proven to best serve students and employers.
  I ask all my colleagues to join in supporting this bipartisan 
legislation that is broadly supported by job creators and educators 
from across our great nation.
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Strengthening 
Career and Technical Education Act.
  I devoted 35 years to workforce education so I know the career and 
economic opportunities possible through technical education. The Bureau 
of Labor Statistics reports that there are 90 distinct career paths in 
my home state--Michigan--offering an average salary of $50 thousand or 
more that do not require a 4 year college degree. That salary is well 
above the state median annual wage of $45 thousand.
  Yet we lack effective technical training opportunities to reach those 
paths. Too often young people are unaware of those opportunities and 
far too often access to career and technical education is lacking. CTE 
programs give students the opportunities to experience those careers 
and build skills needed for careers.
  This bipartisan legislation updates federal law to support CTE 
programs and to improve access. I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation.
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st 
Century Act, which reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins Career and 
Technical Education Act.
  Mr. Speaker, it's estimated that the U.S. spends $1.6 trillion 
dollars on human capital development each year. That includes spending 
on K-12 education, post-secondary education, and employer-based 
training. In spite of all that spending, fewer than half of Americans 
ages 25 to 64 have completed a credential beyond high school. All over 
my district I hear from employers about the need for workers with the 
right skills. Career and technical education is one way to do this.
  I am pleased this legislation encourages states to utilize work-based 
learning, but I would also note that I think we can further strengthen 
it by encouraging apprenticeships, both registered and unregistered. As 
our nation continues to transition itself from analog to digital, so 
must our workforce. Apprenticeships are needed not only in traditional 
trades, but also in emerging fields like advanced manufacturing and the 
technology sector. President Trump demonstrated his commitment to this 
workforce development model in a speech last week, and I look forward 
to working on this model with the Chairwoman.
  With these important reforms, we can help ensure the labor force of 
tomorrow has the skills it needs.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2353, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                          ____________________
