                     LISTENING TO EVERYBODY'S VOICE

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, you can learn a lot when you listen. During 
times like these, when political infighting makes it difficult to hear 
everyone's voice, we need to try even harder.
  Today I would like to encourage all of my constituents in the 
Illinois 12th District to visit bost.house.gov/yourstory to share your 
personal perspective on the Affordable Care Act. Again, that is 
bost.house.gov/yourstory.
  If the law has helped you and your family receive care you needed, I 
want to hear about it. If the law has put you in a situation where you 
don't have insurance or have higher premiums, I want to hear about 
that, too.
  It is important that we deal with this healthcare issue and reform it 
so that it works for all people. And for the people of southern 
Illinois, I want to hear your story.
