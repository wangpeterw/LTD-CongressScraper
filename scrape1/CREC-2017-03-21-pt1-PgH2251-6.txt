                BIG PHARMA IS A BIG WINNER IN TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Thursday these Republicans are awarding a

new grand prize, a big-dollar award. Unfortunately, the contest has 
been rigged so that your name is not in the winner's circle. Instead, 
the world leaders in prescription price gouging, highest drug prices to 
Americans than just about anywhere, are declared the winners of the 
grand prize in the Trump Republican sweepstakes that they call 
repealing ObamaCare.
  With Big Pharma's exceptional, distinguished service in charging 
astronomical prices and blocking competition to their government-
approved monopolies, these Republicans have included a no-strings-
attached $25 billion tax windfall for Big Pharma in their so-called 
ObamaCare repeal.
  Now, with their latest late-night amendment, the prize is already 
growing bigger and bigger by the moment. And all of those American 
families that are out there struggling, trying to access lifesaving 
drugs, they don't win a dime in this contest.
  Mr. Speaker, let's reject this phony Republican giveaway where only 
Big Pharma is the big winner.
