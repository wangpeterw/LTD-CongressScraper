                      HONORING ANGELA LARA FLORES

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Angela 
Lara Flores, a dedicated servant to her community and her family.
  Angela was born in Palacios, Texas, on August 2, 1926, to her parents 
Cesario Lara and Lydia Teran.
  She was a devoted, longtime member of Casa de Dios Presbyterian 
Church and served as the treasurer of the church for 32 years.
  Not only did Angela give her time and energy to the church, but she 
was also known for her community service. She volunteered faithfully at 
a local senior citizens center in Dallas and even worked full time for 
the senior citizens center in Palacios.
  Despite her busy schedule, Angela had time for her favorite pastime, 
and that was putting puzzles together with her family.
  My heartfelt sympathy goes out to her four children--Jesse J. Flores, 
Lucinda Flores, Diana Flores, and Steve Flores--5 siblings, 19 
grandchildren, 43 great-grandchildren, 8 great-great-grandchildren, and 
numerous nieces and nephews.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Angela's 90 years of 
life.
