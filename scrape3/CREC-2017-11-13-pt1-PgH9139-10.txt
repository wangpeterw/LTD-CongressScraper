  CONGRATULATING BILL BETHEA ON RECEIVING THE SERGEANT WILLIAM JASPER 
                             FREEDOM AWARD

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Bill 
Bethea, chairman of the South Carolina Military Base Task Force, on 
receiving the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce Sergeant William 
Jasper Freedom Award this year. Bill and his wife, Paula, are 
appreciated State leaders for families.
  The Sergeant William Jasper Freedom Award is named for the 
Revolutionary War patriot and is given to those who have performed 
outstanding public service and contributions to the freedom of the 
people of South Carolina and our Nation.
  As chairman of South Carolina's Military Base Task Force, Chairman 
Bethea has worked with leaders across the Nation to enhance the value 
of South Carolina's military installations and facilities. He has also 
improved the quality of life for military personnel and their families.
  As the father of four sons in military service who have served 
overseas, I am grateful for the leadership of Bill Bethea. This is a 
well-deserved honor. I look forward to working with him in the future 
to make sure our men and women in uniform who call South Carolina home 
are fully appreciated.

  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
