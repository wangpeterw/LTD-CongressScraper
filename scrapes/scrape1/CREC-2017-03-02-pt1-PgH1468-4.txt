                HONORING CARL LAMM ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a North Carolina 
legend as he celebrates his 90th birthday this week. Mr. Carl Lamm, who 
many know as ``the Voice of Johnston County,'' has been a pioneer of 
the country music radio scene since 1946.
  ``Mr. Carl,'' as he is known, has been a disc jockey and co-owner of 
WMPM-AM in Smithfield, North Carolina, since 1958, where he plays a 
lively mix of bluegrass, Southern gospel, and old-time country. His 
daily programming is revered by tens of thousands throughout Johnston 
County, North Carolina, and all across the Nation.
  In the seven decades Carl has been on the air, he has brought some of 
the greatest musicians, top athletes, and national political figures 
into our homes and businesses through radio to discuss current events, 
politics, our Creator, and much more.
  Mr. Carl has witnessed the evolution of radio from the glory days of 
the Grand Ole Opry to the digital age of the 21st century. To say that 
Mr. Carl Lamm is a radio legend is an understatement.
  Carl Lamm, thank you for everything you have done for our State and 
for our country. Again, happy birthday.
