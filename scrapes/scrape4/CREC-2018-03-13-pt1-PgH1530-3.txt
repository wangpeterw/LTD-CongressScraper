               CONGRATULATING IMPACT CHRISTIAN TV NETWORK

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the country's only African-
American owned Christian television network, the IMPACT Christian TV 
network.
  Over the weekend, at Metropolitan Baptist Church in Newark, New 
Jersey, I joined IMPACT for the celebration of their launch onto the 
Altice family of programming. The launch is a big step for Altice and 
people across the Nation.
  The partnership between IMPACT and Altice means that the country's 
only African-American owned and operated Christian television network 
will now reach more than 85 million homes around the world.
  As we have seen with the ``Oscars So Black'' movement and spotlight 
on inequality in film and television, people across the country are 
demanding increased diversity in programming.
  IMPACT's launch on Altice is another step in the right direction. It 
is a historic pairing that will bring diversity and ministry to 
millions of homes.
  I would like to point out that, in my district, the 10th 
Congressional District of the State of New Jersey, I want to commend 
two local heroes for helping move this effort forward.
  I want to commend Reverend Dr. David Jefferson of Metropolitan 
Baptist Church and the IMPACT team, and Marilyn Davis and the Altice 
team for what they did to make this launch happen.
