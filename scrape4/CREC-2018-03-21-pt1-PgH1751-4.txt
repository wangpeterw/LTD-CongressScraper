                   CONGRATULATING THE VICTORY CENTER

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate The 
Victory Center for Autism and Related Disabilities on the upcoming 
completion of its state-of-the-art education facility in south Florida.
  Since its founding in 2000, The Victory Center has excelled at 
providing children with autism and related disabilities comprehensive 
individualized treatment and education. For 18 years, the teachers at 
The Victory Center have achieved amazing success working out of only a 
handful of rooms on the campus of the Michael-Ann Russell Jewish 
Community Center in North Miami Beach.
  This outstanding institution is proud to offer five programs covering 
a range of services, and it is recognized as one of the top schools for 
children with autism in the Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, by opening this brand-new facility, The Victory Center 
will continue to grow and offer a positive and nurturing educational 
environment.

  Once again, I would like to congratulate everyone at The Victory 
Center for all that they have accomplished. I thank their staff for 
helping so many children in our south Florida community achieve their 
full potential and leave their own beautiful mark on our world.
