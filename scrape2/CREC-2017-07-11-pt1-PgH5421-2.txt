                  PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT HEALTHCARE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, last week, as I traveled throughout my 
district, I heard time and time and time again from people worried 
about one issue: healthcare. I heard stories like Diane's in Mundelein, 
who was able to get affordable coverage through ACA after losing her 
job of 30 years to outsourcing, and Claire's, from Vernon Hills, who 
was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis just a month before her 26th 
birthday. Yet, because of ACA, she has insurance today, despite her 
preexisting condition.
  I was thrilled to learn that Claire recently got married, and is 
looking forward to pursuing her dreams: raising a family and living a 
long and productive life.
  Mr. Speaker, across the country, there are millions of stories just 
like these. The ACA is far from perfect and it needs work. I heard that 
from my constituents as well.
  I urge my colleagues here in Congress to listen to the people who 
share their stories with me and others and end this ill-considered 
repeal effort. Instead, let's get to work together to deliver quality, 
affordable healthcare for all Americans.
