        HONORING DR. THOMAS FREEMAN OF TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a commemoration of African 
American History Month. It is a vital month. It is a month that tells 
America's history.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute a distinguished American, Dr. 
Thomas Freeman, who has been a faculty member at Texas Southern 
University now for more than half a century. Dr. Freeman is the leading 
orator of the university, the leading storyteller.
  He is the instructor of the Honorable Barbara Jordan, my predecessor. 
He taught her the skills to be able to sit before the Judiciary 
Committee during the impeachment of Richard Milhous Nixon and say, 
``We, the people.''
  He is the individual that has taught and tutored decades of 
students--tens upon tens--from a school that is a historically Black 
school and called and taught his students to be successful in debates 
around the world.
  He is a history maker. He is now close to 100 years old. He is 
deserving of honor and tradition.
  I close, Mr. Speaker, by saying, in our community, he is the tiller 
and the holder of the values of the Constitution. I know that he 
deserves honor on this floor.
  Dr. Freeman, I salute you. You deserve the honor and recognition as a 
great American.
