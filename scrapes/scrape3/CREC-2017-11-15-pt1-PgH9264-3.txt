                                 PRAYER

  Dr. Glynn Stone, Mobberly Baptist Church, Longview, Texas, offered 
the following prayer:
  Thank You, Lord, for these times when our Nation has recognized her 
need for You. God, You are our help in ages past and our hope for years 
to come. You can see our trust in You is engraved throughout this very 
building. So before any speeches are heard or votes are cast or 
decisions are made, we recognize that our greatness comes only from 
Your grace.
  So I humbly ask You to remind each of these, Your servants, of their 
special responsibility, to lead in Your way, to lean on Your word, and 
to listen to Your voice. As they represent constituents, may they 
defend the defenseless, protect those in danger, and promote good, so 
that all Americans can reflect Your image and bring glory to You and 
accomplish Your will.
  Your providential hand has promoted us to these lofty positions and 
will assuredly judge our stewardship of these responsibilities. So we 
submit this day and ourselves to You, Jesus, my Lord.
  Amen.
