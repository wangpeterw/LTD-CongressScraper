                     NORTH KOREA IS A SLAVE TRADER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a new soccer stadium in St. 
Petersburg, a luxury apartment complex in Moscow, all brought to Russia 
by North Korean slaves. That is right. These slaves get almost no 
wages, no holidays, with little food or sleep.
  Little Kim not only enslaves his own people at home, he runs an 
international slave trade. The slave network brings in $2 billion to $3 
billion every year to the North Korean military complex and helps 
little Kim evade sanctions. This is state-sponsored human trafficking 
and slavery.
  The slaves are not just sent to Russia. It is troublemakers like 
China and Qatar, too, that are slave destinations.
  Secretary Tillerson has called upon all countries to fully implement 
U.N. Security Council resolutions to sever or downgrade diplomatic 
relations with North Korea in order to financially isolate that 
country. It is time these countries comply with the United Nations 
resolutions, and we must send a united message to North Korea: End your 
slave trade and stop the saber rattling.
  And that is just the way it is.
