                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gary Studniewski, St. Peter's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  O God, You, who have looked upon this grand American experiment with 
such favor from its beginning and who have preserved it by Your 
providence, graciously hear our prayers for our Nation, that it may be 
a bastion of liberty, of justice, of true freedom.
  Bless this governing assembly with the spirit of Your wisdom, that 
its Members may decide everything for the well-being and peace of all. 
May these servants never turn aside from just and noble purposes, as 
You give them the light to discern these purposes.
  Dear Lord, grant each House Member, their families, and their staffs 
strength, comfort, and always the peace of the kingdom where You reign 
today and forever.
  Amen.
