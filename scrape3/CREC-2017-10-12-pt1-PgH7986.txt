                       SUPPORTING THE CARE CORPS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage my 
colleagues to support the Care Corps Demonstration Act.
  By the year 2030, there will be more than 72 million older Americans. 
As they age, many of these seniors will require long-term support and 
services, placing a significant burden on our elder care system that is 
already struggling to provide and finance services to our seniors.
  The Care Corps Demonstration Act, which my colleague Congresswoman 
Michelle Lujan Grisham and I have introduced, will address this growing 
need by placing Care Corps volunteers in communities where they will 
provide essential services to seniors that will allow these older 
Americans to remain independent. In turn, these wonderful volunteers 
will receive assistance in paying down their educational expenses.
  More importantly, Mr. Speaker, this program will help us train a new 
generation of healthcare providers to meet our Nation's demand for 
senior care services b giving our students essential, real-world 
experience in the field.

  Mr. Speaker, this bill will create stronger communities across our 
Nation by bringing generations of Americans together. I encourage my 
colleagues to support our bill, the Care Corps Demonstration Act, of 
this session. The bill number, Mr. Speaker, is H.R. 3493.
  So please contact my congressional office or the office of 
Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham to cosponsor H.R. 3493.
