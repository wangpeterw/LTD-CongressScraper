  So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and 
the bill was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated for:
  Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 559.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, October 10, I missed two votes 
to attend to constituent business in my district. Had I been present 
for the day's vote series, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 
558, the passage of H.R. 1858, to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty, 
Pennsylvania, as the ``Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office''; 
and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 559, the passage of H.R. 2464, to designate 
the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 25 New 
Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, as the ``John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy Post Office''.
