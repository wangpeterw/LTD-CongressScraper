           SNAP: 40 YEARS OF PROVIDING NUTRITION TO AMERICANS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 40th 
anniversary of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, which was a landmark bill 
that made the program more effective and more efficient.
  Today, we no longer refer to it as food stamps, but as the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. In 40 years, there 
have been numerous changes and updates, but the goal remains the same: 
to end hunger in America.
  SNAP lessens the effects of poverty on some of our most vulnerable 
citizens. The results are proven. According to the Census Bureau, SNAP 
lifted 5 million Americans, including 2.2 million children, out of 
poverty in 2012 alone. SNAP generates $1.80 in economic activity for 
every $1 in new SNAP benefits.
  In 2013, SNAP payment accuracy was 96.8 percent, which was a historic 
high.

Participating in SNAP for 6 months decreased food insecurity up to 10 
percent, including households with children.
  Mr. Speaker, for over four decades, the program has become more 
effective, more efficient, and more modern. I look forward to 
continuing our work to improve SNAP, to serve those in need, and to 
provide pathways out of poverty.
