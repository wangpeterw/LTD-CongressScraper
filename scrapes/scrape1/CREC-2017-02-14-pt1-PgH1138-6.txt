            REPEAL WITHOUT REPLACEMENT WOULD BE DEVASTATING

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)

  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are moving ahead with the repeal 
of ObamaCare--but years later, after all the talk, they still have no 
replacement. Six weeks into control of this Congress and of this 
government--all branches--there is no plan.
  From today's Politico, it reads: ``House conservatives . . . are 
plotting a major push to repeal the law immediately without 
simultaneously approving an alternative.''
  The consequences of Republican repeal without replacement are 
devastating: 30 million Americans would lose health coverage. People 
could be kicked off their coverage. They would not be allowed coverage 
if they have a preexisting condition. Young people could be kicked off 
their parents' plans.
  In recent weeks, Republicans have been bombarded with messages from 
their constituents sending a clear message that the Affordable Care Act 
repeal would be devastating to their family. It would be devastating to 
real people like Jia Ireland, my constituent, who, before ACA, had no 
health insurance. Because of Medicaid expansion, she and 600,000 other 
Michiganders have coverage.
  We cannot lose access to health care in this country. We ought not do 
that.
