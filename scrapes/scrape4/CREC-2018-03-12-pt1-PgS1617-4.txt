                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, our source of hope, we praise You for Your daily 
mercies. Bless our lawmakers with Your goodness, empowering them to 
labor for justice and truth.
  Lord, guide them as they grapple with difficult issues so that they 
will choose right over political expediency. Give them wisdom to forget 
yesterday's disappointments and tomorrow's fears. Teach them to focus 
on accomplishing their present duties for Your Name's glory, trusting 
You to take care of all their tomorrows. May they build their hopes in 
You.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
