       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted 
     by the United Nations 69 years ago on December 10, 1948, 
     represents the first comprehensive agreement among nations as 
     to the specific rights and freedoms of all human beings;
       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights upholds 
     the basic principles of liberty and freedom enshrined in the 
     Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights;
       Whereas awareness of human rights--
       (1) is essential to the realization of fundamental 
     freedoms;
       (2) promotes equality;
       (3) contributes to preventing conflict and human rights 
     violations; and
       (4) enhances participation in democratic processes;
       Whereas Congress has a proud history of promoting human 
     rights that are internationally recognized; and
       Whereas December 10 of each year is celebrated around the 
     world as ``Human Rights Day'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the 69th anniversary of the Universal 
     Declaration of Human Rights and the celebration of ``Human 
     Rights Day'';
       (2) supports the ideals of human rights and reaffirms the 
     Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
       (3) encourages all nations to continue working towards 
     freedom, peace, and security, which can be achieved through 
     democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law; and
       (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
     ``Human Rights Day'' and continue a commitment to upholding 
     freedom, democracy, and human rights across the globe.
