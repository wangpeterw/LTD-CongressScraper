                           ORDER OF BUSINESS

  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we 
are now on the bill, S. 2155. We have offered a bipartisan substitute 
that reflects the priorities from Members on both sides of the aisle. 
We are ready to begin the process of voting on further amendments.
  I have discussed the path forward with the majority leader, and we 
would like to begin alternating amendments and setting votes on them 
with limited time agreements. The first two amendments on the 
Republican side are a Paul amendment to audit the Federal Reserve and a 
Moran amendment to restructure the management and funding of the CFPB. 
I understand there are several amendments on the Democratic side, as 
well, and we are willing to start setting those votes in an alternating 
fashion. It is my understanding, however, that there are objections on 
the Democratic side to setting votes at this time, but I hope we can 
convene tomorrow and start the process of voting on amendments and work 
together in cooperation to finalize the amendment process.

                          ____________________
