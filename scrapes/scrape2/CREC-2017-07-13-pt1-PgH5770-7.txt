                 HONORING MICHAEL ``MATT'' PATRICK RYAN

  (Mr. BRADY of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life 
and faith of my friend, local Houston radio favorite, Michael ``Matt'' 
Patrick Ryan.
  Matt came to Houston after stints in New York, Indiana, and Ohio. 
Boy, he just became a favorite of our region, his no-nonsense but so 
optimistic way of informing and entertaining us as host of KTRH Morning 
News and his syndicated afternoon show.
  In September of 2015, Matt faced a new challenge--stage IV melanoma. 
He shared his struggle with us. Matt's battle with cancer ended last 
Sunday, July 9, but his inspiration is eternal.
  So today, as a country, we all join Matt's family--especially his 
best friend and wife, Paula; children, Alexandra, Alanna, and Jake; his 
family, friends, and listeners in ``the Sandbox''--to recognize his 
lifetime of service, his courage, and his absolute faith in God.
  We love you, Matt. You will be missed, friend.
