                          HONORING KEVIN LYNCH

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend, Kevin 
Lynch, who passed away following a 5-year battle with cancer just this 
week.
  Kevin was a great Hoosier, a public servant, a tremendous leader, and 
a tireless advocate in advancing southeastern Indiana. He served as a 
Dearborn County commissioner and as the president of the Ohio-Kentucky-
Indiana Regional Council of Governments.
  Kevin was a giant Reds fan and a loyal friend, with a positive 
spirit, quick with a smile, and an encouraging word.
  Kevin served Lawrenceburg and Dearborn County with pride, but his 
most important priority was his family. He was the loving husband to 
Mary Jo--``Joey''--for 27 years and the proud father of Michael. Mr. 
Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Lynch family and 
all those who knew Kevin well.
  Congratulations to my good friend Kevin on a tremendous life well 
done. Godspeed my friend.
