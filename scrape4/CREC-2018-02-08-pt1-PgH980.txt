                      THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT PROJECT

  (Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, 
Ms. Tijuana Fulford, founder and executive director of the Butterfly 
Effect Project in Riverhead.
  In 2014, Ms. Fulford set out to establish a free program to provide 
young girls with the tools they need to achieve self-confident futures 
in hopes of bringing forth a generation of strong, independent, and 
knowledgeable women.
  This program has grown from 4 to 108 young girls with an ever-growing 
waitlist. These are girls who are empowered with the resources 
necessary to secure a prosperous future for themselves and their 
families.
  Through financial, educational, emotional, and career support, the 
Butterfly Effect Project is building community involvement and 
curtailing the effects of cultural and mobility limitations.
  With locations in Riverhead and Bellport, the Butterfly Effect 
Project is having such a positive effect on young girls from Riverhead, 
Flanders, Calverton, Mastic, Shirley, Bellport, Westhampton, Peconic, 
Patchogue, and West Islip.
  The Butterfly Effect Project has provided an invaluable service to 
our community. I applaud Ms. Fulford for her dedication, and I look 
forward to witnessing the growth of her organization and the bright 
future of so many of the young women it supports.
