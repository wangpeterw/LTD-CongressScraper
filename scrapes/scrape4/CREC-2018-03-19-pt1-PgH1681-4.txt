                  HAPPY 110TH BIRTHDAY TO GOLDIE SMALL

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a distinguished 
constituent from my district named Goldie Small from Binghamton, New 
York. Goldie currently resides at the Good Shepherd Fairview Home in 
Binghamton, where she will turn 110 years old on April 1.
  Goldie was born in Paris, New York--on Paris Hill as we call it--on 
April 1, 1908, and lived there until 1940, when she moved to New 
Milford, Pennsylvania.
  As a child, Goldie went to a one-room schoolhouse until she attended 
high school in Waterville, New York. In order to get to and from the 
schoolbus, she either had to hitch a ride, walk 1 mile to catch a 
train, or use a horse and carriage to travel all the way to Waterville.
  After high school, Goldie went to school in Rochester, New York, to 
the famous Eastman School to become a dental hygienist. Shortly after, 
the Depression hit and very few people could afford the luxury of 
dental care, so she went back to school to become a secretary.
  After getting married and moving to Pennsylvania, Goldie had two 
children, Glenn and Marion.
  Goldie has an amazing memory, never forgetting any of the birthdays 
of her six grandchildren and, now, nine great-grandchildren.
  To this day, she continues to play bridge and other card games as 
well as completing the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask to have everyone join me in wishing Goldie a very 
happy 110 years. She is an inspiration to all of us on a long, clean 
life.
