                   NATIONAL DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, each November, communities across the country 
observe National Diabetes Awareness Month. We come together to educate 
our neighbors and to bring attention to the impact that diabetes has in 
the lives of millions of Americans.
  As a diabetic, I know the challenges faced by people with this 
condition.
  In 2015, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death for 
Americans, and diagnosis rates continue to grow each year.
  To live a long and prosperous life with this disease, it is 
imperative that people with diabetes receive proper nutrition and 
access to healthcare. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, preexisting 
conditions such as diabetes are covered by health insurance. Thanks to 
SNAP, the poorest in our communities have access to nutrition.
  ACA and SNAP are under attack, and as a member of the Diabetes Caucus 
and as your Representative in Congress, I will continue to vigorously 
protect the ACA and fight to increase SNAP benefits for those in need.
  My life is a living testament to the opportunities that exist when 
diabetes is properly treated. We must ensure these opportunities are 
available for the next generation.
