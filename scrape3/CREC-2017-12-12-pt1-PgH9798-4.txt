                            NEW YORK STRONG

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, a 
terrorist tried to attack the lifeblood of New York City: our subway 
system. It is another somber reminder that New York City, a beacon of 
hope and freedom, remains a target for terrorists.
  We had the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, another one on 
9/11 in 2001, the Chelsea bombing last year, the truck attack earlier 
this year, and another bombing yesterday.
  In addition, the New York Police Department openly talks about 27 
other attempts to harm New Yorkers, which were thwarted. By now, it 
should be clear that we cannot play politics with Federal funding for 
local law enforcement and homeland security. The funding for States and 
cities, especially high-threat areas, must not be delayed, diminished, 
or cut off.
  While we are still learning more about this latest attack, one thing 
is clear: the terrorist wanted to strike fear into the hearts of every 
New Yorker, but he failed. New Yorkers will always persevere in the 
face of diversity. Our trains are running. Our people are back to work.
  I wish the three people injured yesterday a swift and speedy 
recovery. I want to express my gratitude to the law enforcement of New 
York City and the heroic response of our first responders. We are all 
very grateful to them for what they do for us every day.
