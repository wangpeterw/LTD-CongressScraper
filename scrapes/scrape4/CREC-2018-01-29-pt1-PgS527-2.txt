                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we lift our hearts to You. You are the source of our 
strength. You are our hope for tomorrow. Continue to show our lawmakers 
the path where they should walk, leading them to Your desired 
destination. Lord, inspire them to continuously put their hope in You. 
As they remember Your unfailing love and compassion, remind them that 
nothing is impossible to those who believe.
  We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
