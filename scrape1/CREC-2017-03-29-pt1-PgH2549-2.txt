             MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO SECURE OUR BORDER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, foreign national Tommy Alvarado-
Ventura has a string of arrests to his name, including assault, 
impersonation, drunk driving, and contempt of court. Not to mention 
that he has been deported four times. And, oh, yes, Madam Speaker, he 
is an MS-13 gang member.
  Despite being deported four times, he made his way back to America. 
This time, he stabbed a woman in a parking lot. Then he went to a house 
only to sexually assault a 2-year-old. When his girlfriend saw the 
bruises on the child, he stabbed her as well. Eventually, NYPD arrested 
him.
  Madam Speaker, our porous border is not secure. Foreign criminals who 
violently assault and rape women and children in the United States keep 
coming back to America. Border officials are doing the best they can do 
with what they have.
  But the message is clear: they need more to secure our border. 
Washington must send more resources, boots on the ground, aerostats, 
and military equipment, if necessary, to establish a virtual border 
wall against outlaws like Alvarado-Ventura.
  And that is just the way it is.
