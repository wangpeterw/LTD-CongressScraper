    CONGRATULATING SHAWNEE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Shawnee Community 
College, located in Ullin, Illinois, for its 50th anniversary.
  For half a century, Shawnee College has provided opportunities for 
quality higher education, community education, training, and services 
that are accessible, affordable, and promote lifelong learning. The 
college is cutting edge and provides training programs that incorporate 
the most recent technologies to meet the ever-changing needs of 
students and the local economy.
  I visited the community college last month and met with the faculty 
and their directors, and their passion is clear.
  Congratulations to Shawnee College President Dr. Peggy Bradford, 
faculty, staff, and students on 50 years of excellence. I know that 
more than 50 years from now they will still be working and providing 
for the students of southern Illinois.
