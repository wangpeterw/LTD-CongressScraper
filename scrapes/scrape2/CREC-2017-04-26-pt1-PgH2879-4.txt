              SECURING THE BORDER AND THE HEROIN EPIDEMIC

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, one of the big issues in last year's 
Presidential campaign was border security. As we mark 100 days of the 
Trump administration, we should acknowledge how President Trump has 
restored confidence and morale among our Border Patrol agents. They now 
know that our President will back them as they work to enforce our 
Nation's immigration laws.
  The agents told me personally about their renewed ability to do their 
job during my recent trip to inspect the southern border. What was 
remarkable was that I heard the same thing from every agent, man or 
women, regardless of ethnic background.
  President Trump understands that we have an urgent and solemn 
responsibility to stop the flood of heroin and other narcotics pouring 
across our southern border, poisoning our communities.
  We must secure our border and end this scourge for the sake of 
mothers like the one in my district who lost her beloved son to a 
heroin overdose and asked God to ``damn heroin.'' I look forward to 
more action in the next 100 days as we continue to work to secure our 
border.
