 SENATE RESOLUTION 265--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 22, 2017, AS ``NATIONAL 
 FALLS PREVENTION AWARENESS DAY'' TO RAISE AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGE THE 
                 PREVENTION OF FALLS AMONG OLDER ADULTS

  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 265

       Whereas individuals who are 65 years of age or older 
     (referred to in this preamble as ``older adults'') are the 
     fastest growing segment of the population in the United 
     States and the number of older adults in the United States 
     will increase from 46,200,000 in 2014 to 82,300,000 in 2040;

[[Page S5867]]

       Whereas more than 1 of 4 older adults in the United States 
     falls each year;
       Whereas falls are the leading cause of both fatal and 
     nonfatal injuries among older adults;
       Whereas, in 2014, approximately 2,800,000 older adults were 
     treated in hospital emergency departments for fall-related 
     injuries and more than 812,000 of those older adults were 
     subsequently hospitalized;
       Whereas, in 2014, more than 27,000 older adults died from 
     injuries related to unintentional falls and the death rates 
     from falls of older adults in the United States have risen 
     sharply in the last decade;
       Whereas, in 2015, the total direct medical cost of fall-
     related injuries for older adults, adjusted for inflation, 
     was $31,000,000,000;
       Whereas, if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, 
     the annual cost of fall injuries will reach $67,700,000,000 
     by 2020; and
       Whereas evidence-based programs reduce falls by utilizing 
     cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs to 
     improve balance and strength, medication management, vision 
     improvement, reduction of home hazards, and fall prevention 
     education: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates September 22, 2017, as ``National Falls 
     Prevention Awareness Day'';
       (2) recognizes that there are proven, cost-effective falls 
     prevention programs and policies;
       (3) commends the 72 member organizations of the Falls Free 
     Coalition and the falls prevention coalitions in 43 States 
     and the District of Columbia for their efforts to work 
     together to increase education and awareness about preventing 
     falls among older adults;
       (4) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and 
     local governments, the public health community, and health 
     care providers to work together to raise awareness of falls 
     in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older 
     adults in the United States;
       (5) recognizes the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention for its work developing and evaluating 
     interventions for all members of health care teams to make 
     falls prevention a routine part of clinical care;
       (6) recognizes the Administration for Community Living for 
     its work to promote access to evidence-based programs and 
     services in communities across the United States;
       (7) encourages State health departments and State units on 
     aging, which provide significant leadership in reducing 
     injuries and related health care costs by collaborating with 
     organizations and individuals, to reduce falls among older 
     adults; and
       (8) encourages experts in the field of falls prevention to 
     share their best practices so that their success can be 
     replicated by others.
