                            DUCKS UNLIMITED

  (Mr. THOMPSON of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
great contributions of Ducks Unlimited.
  For 80 years, Ducks Unlimited has played an important role in the 
wetland conservation process in our country by fighting for critical 
conservation policies in our national and State capitols and conducting 
outreach and education to bring the next generation of sportsmen and -
women into play.
  They have raised billions of dollars to conserve more than 14 million 
acres, and they have biologists on the ground working with local 
partners to bring these projects across the finish line.
  Ducks Unlimited has had great success in making critical habitat 
improvements to wetlands that support healthy flyway populations, clean 
air and water, and strong local economies.
