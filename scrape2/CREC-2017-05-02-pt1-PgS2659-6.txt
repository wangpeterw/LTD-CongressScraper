                       NOMINATION OF JAY CLAYTON

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, on another matter, Senators voted 
on a bipartisan basis yesterday to advance Jay Clayton's nomination to 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and soon we will take 
another vote to confirm him.
  As Chairman Crapo noted at Clayton's confirmation hearing, this 
nominee has an impressive background. His extensive work in the private 
sector will serve him well as he looks to strengthen our financial 
markets, thereby supporting American businesses, boosting job creation, 
and spurring economic growth. I appreciate Mr. Clayton's willingness to 
take on this important task, as well as his vision, which he outlined 
at his hearing, to promote fair and transparent practices at the SEC.
  I look forward to his confirmation and to his leadership at this 
agency.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
