                OCTOBER IS BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Breast Cancer 
Awareness Month and all who have been affected by this terrible 
disease. Each October we take time to raise awareness about the threat 
breast cancer poses to women and men throughout the country and the 
world.
  Studies show that one in eight women across the Nation will be 
diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and that more than 
249,000 people in the United States are diagnosed each year. Roughly 1 
percent of those are men.
  This month, it is not only imperative that we reflect upon all who 
are affected by breast cancer, but that we also take action to fight 
against it.
  Today I would like to recognize a courageous constituent, friend, and 
cancer survivor, Karen Newton. Earlier this year, I played in the 
Congressional Women's Softball Game in honor of Karen's triumph over 
breast cancer. Karen is a vibrant testament to the fact that strides we 
make in medicine are helping cancer patient and their loved ones, 
though I don't think she is a very good driver.

  Whether it is wearing pink to raise awareness or offering support to 
a brave person who is fighting this disease, in October, let's all join 
together to fight to end breast cancer.
