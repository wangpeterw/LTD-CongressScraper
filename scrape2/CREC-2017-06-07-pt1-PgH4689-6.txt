        DISAPPROVING OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong 
disapproval of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States 
from the international Paris Agreement on global climate change. The 
world is watching us, and history will judge this ill-considered 
decision harshly.
  Withdrawing from the accord weakens America's global leadership, will 
slow our transition to renewable sources of energy, and make it more 
likely the clean energy jobs of tomorrow will be created overseas 
rather than here at home.
  Let me be clear: Climate change is real and a present threat. America 
can and should be the global leader in developing innovative solutions, 
but this decision leaves us as an international outlier.

  I am proud my hometown, Chicago, joins cities and States across the 
country that have pledged to continue honoring the emission reductions 
that are part of the Paris Agreement. That is why I am introducing a 
resolution to commend these States and localities and to urge the 
administration to reverse its position.
  I invite my colleagues to join me. Irrespective of President Trump's 
shortsighted policies, we must continue to seek solutions to protect 
our planet for future generations.
