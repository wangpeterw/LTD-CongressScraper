                MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING JON RICHARDS

  (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to celebrate the life of Jon Richards, a Georgia treasure, a 
brilliant political journalist, a selfless mentor. He passed away this 
past Sunday after a battle with cancer. Our prayers go out and we 
grieve for the family and friends of Jon during this difficult time.
  Madam Speaker, Jon grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and later moved to 
Lawrenceville, Georgia, where he became active in various Gwinnett 
County civic, social, and political organizations.
  He was well respected on both sides of the political aisle, serving 
with endless passion as editor-in-chief of georgiapol.com. Most 
notably, however, was his devotion to mentoring high school and college 
students who were interested in politics, and he left a lasting 
impression.
  Madam Speaker, Jon was known by the Gwinnett community as someone who 
lived life to its fullest and made the most of every day. His 
leadership was unmatched and cannot be overstated.
  I am grateful to know that, through Christ, we will be able to meet 
again.
  Madam Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join with me 
for a moment of silence to honor the life and legacy of Jon Richards, 
who will be sorely missed by many.
