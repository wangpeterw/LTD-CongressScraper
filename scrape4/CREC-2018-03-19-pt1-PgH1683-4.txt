  HONORING JOCELYNE AND MONIQUE LAMOUREUX OF THE U.S. WOMEN'S OLYMPIC 
                              HOCKEY TEAM

  (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, as we observe Women's History Month and 
continue celebrating the historic Olympic Gold Medal won by the U.S. 
women's hockey team, I rise to recognize two remarkable sisters from 
Grand Forks.
  Jocelyne and Monique Lamoureux grew up in one of North Dakota's 
premier hockey families. These sisters have played together since they 
were teenagers and were standouts at the University of North Dakota. 
The first set of twins to play women's ice hockey in the Olympics, they 
brought home silver medals in 2010 and 2014. In last month's 
championship game against Canada, they helped make this win golden: 
Monique's goal tied the game, and Jocelyne flawlessly executed the 
game-winning shootout goal.
  Since returning home, they have joined Team USA in appearances across 
the Nation, inspiring a new generation of women athletes. A cheering 
crowd filled the Engelstad Hockey Arena in Grand Forks, many of them 
young girls and women on area hockey teams who came to congratulate 
their hometown champions who brought the U.S. women's hockey team their 
first Olympic Gold Medal.
  On behalf of all North Dakotans, I salute Jocelyne and Monique. You 
have set a high bar for women athletes across the Nation, and North 
Dakota honors your excellence.
