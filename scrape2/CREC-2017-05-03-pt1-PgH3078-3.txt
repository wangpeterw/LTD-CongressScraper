                         VIETNAMESE BLACK APRIL

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday we commemorated the 42nd 
anniversary of Black April and the fall of Saigon. On this day, we are 
reminded of the pain of losing your homeland and of the sacrifices made 
in search for freedom.
  When Saigon fell in 1975, thousands of families were forced to flee 
their home, and many came to America with nothing but hope and their 
dreams to keep them alive.
  Today I am proud to have represented Little Saigon, the largest 
concentration of Vietnamese outside of Vietnam. Each and every one of 
them has a personal connection to the sacrifices that their families 
have made and to the loss of their homes. This shared experience has 
made the Vietnamese community and culture thrive in Orange County, 
California.
  I am honored to represent this community and mourn alongside with 
them. I am proud that America gave them shelter in their time of need.
  The U.S. must always be a beacon of hope to those without hope. We 
must continue to stand up for human rights and religious freedom.
