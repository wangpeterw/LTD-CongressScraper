 CONGRATULATING MAYOR BRUNO CARNOVALE ON MORE THAN 50 YEARS OF SERVICE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Emporium Borough Mayor Bruno Carnovale on his upcoming 
retirement after more than 50 years of service to the community.
  Mayor Carnovale first served as a council person for 18 years, then 
as civil service chairperson for the Emporium Borough Police Department 
for 4 years, and, most recently, as mayor beginning in 1988.
  It was 1966 when Bruno Carnovale ran for office with the goal of 
finding a solution to continual flooding problems near Oak Street. He 
stuck around long after that goal was achieved.
  Mayor Carnovale grew up in Johnsonburg, but he has had connections to 
Emporium since spending childhood summers working on his grandfather's 
farm. After high school graduation, he moved to Emporium and briefly 
went to work for Sylvania before joining the Navy during World War II. 
After the war, he returned to Sylvania and became a senior electrical 
designer, certified electrical inspector, and master electrician.
  Mayor Carnovale has been active with The American Legion, Lions Club, 
Cameron County Republican Committee, the American Cancer Society, and 
he is an active member of St. Mark's Church.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement, and 
I thank him for his service.
