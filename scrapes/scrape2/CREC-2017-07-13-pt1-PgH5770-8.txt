                        NOT A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
House discriminating against transgender Americans and restricting 
their ability to serve our country, saying now is not the time for a 
social experiment. I firmly believe that the privilege and 
responsibility to defend our country should not be denied to anyone 
based on gender identification.
  Prior to the 1950s, the ``not a social experiment'' argument was used 
to deny African Americans from fully participating in our military. 
Today there is a long history of service and heroism by African 
Americans, including Generals Colin Powell and Vincent Brooks.
  Prior to 2010, the ``not a social experiment'' argument was used to 
keep gays and lesbians from full participation in our military. Today 
there is a long line of distinguished service by gay and lesbian 
servicemembers, including Generals Randy Taylor and Tammy Smith.
  Today there is a long line of transgender servicemembers who are 
ready to distinguish themselves. I welcome their service and appreciate 
their willingness to sacrifice for our Nation.
  As a Member of Congress, I will never deny that privilege and 
responsibility to those who want to serve.
