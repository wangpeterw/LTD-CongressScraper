               NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark National Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day.
  In 2017, 128 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of 
duty. Despite the significant danger they face, these brave men and 
women continue to put their badge on every day, leaving their loved 
ones at home, to protect our friends, our families, and our 
communities.
  I was fortunate to be a member of the thin blue line for nearly a 
decade and a half as an FBI special agent. During that time, I worked 
with some of the most dedicated, mission-oriented professionals in the 
Nation, to include Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers.
  I ask that today, and every day, all Americans take a moment to 
reflect on what our law enforcement officers do to protect our 
liberties and to ensure the safety of our communities. We owe them a 
debt of gratitude for their service and for their sacrifice.
  As I did last year, I urge the President to observe this day by 
lighting the White House blue this evening.
