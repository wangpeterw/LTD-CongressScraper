       Whereas more than 285,000 individuals in the United States 
     live with spinal cord injuries, which cost society billions 
     of dollars in health care costs and lost wages;
       Whereas there are approximately 17,500 new spinal cord 
     injuries in the United States each year;
       Whereas more than 40,000 spinal cord injury victims are 
     veterans who suffered a spinal cord injury while serving in 
     the Armed Forces;
       Whereas motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of 
     spinal cord injuries and the third leading cause of traumatic 
     brain injuries;
       Whereas more than 50 percent of all spinal cord injuries to 
     children under the age of 18 occur as a result of motor 
     vehicle accidents;
       Whereas there is an urgent need to develop new 
     neuroprotection, pharmacological, and regeneration treatments 
     to reduce, prevent, and reverse paralysis; and
       Whereas increased education and investment in research are 
     key factors in improving outcomes for victims of spinal cord 
     injuries, improving the quality of life of victims of spinal 
     cord injuries, and ultimately curing paralysis: Now, 
     therefore, be it

       (5) commends the dedication of national, regional, and 
     local organizations, researchers, doctors, volunteers, and 
     people across the United States that are working to improve 
     the quality of life of individuals living with spinal cord 
     injuries and their families.
