                  MARSHALL COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, this morning began with reports 
of the tragedy at Marshall County High School in Benton, KY. State 
officials have reported at least one confirmed death and several 
injuries. My staff in Western Kentucky is at the high school and is in 
close contact with local officials. They are monitoring the situation 
and will be providing me with updates throughout the day.
  I know I speak for communities across my home State in sending 
prayers of comfort and healing to students, faculty, and everyone 
affected by this violence. Our hearts are with the entire community in 
Marshall County, and our gratitude is with the first responders who 
rushed into harm's way.
