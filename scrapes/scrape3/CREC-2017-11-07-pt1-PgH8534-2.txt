                            SUPPORT VETERANS

  (Mr. THOMPSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Nation 
celebrates Veterans Day. Originally called Armistice Day, November 11, 
1919, marked the end of World War I.
  In 1926, Congress passed a resolution for an annual observance, and 
November 11 became a national holiday in 1938. In 1954, the holiday was 
renamed Veterans Day.
  Mr. Speaker, we all want to thank our veterans for their service to 
this Nation, and there is no better way to do so than to care for them 
when they return home. That is why I encourage my colleagues to support 
the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act, or the VETS Act.
  This bill will be on the floor this afternoon, and it will allow VA 
health professionals to practice telemedicine across State borders to 
care for more of America's veterans. This Nation has the technology 
available today to provide care for our veterans, no matter where they 
reside. This bill upholds our promise to be there for our veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the VETS Act and work to 
give our veterans access to the best care possible, no matter where 
they are or where they live.
