             NOMINATIONS OF SCOTT PALK AND TREVOR McFADDEN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, in addition to our 
important legislative priorities, the Senate is also working hard to 
confirm the President's excellent judicial nominees.
  Last night, I filed cloture on two nominees for U.S. district courts.
  Scott Palk has been nominated to serve as a district judge for the 
Western District of Oklahoma. He has served in multiple roles in the 
U.S. attorney's office in prosecuting organized crime and terrorism 
cases, and the Senate Judiciary Committee sent his nomination to the 
floor with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.
  Another nominee, Trevor McFadden, was voted out of the Judiciary 
Committee with no opposition at all. He has been tapped to serve as a 
district judge for the District of Columbia, and as a former police 
officer, Mr. McFadden will bring a wealth of law enforcement experience 
to the bench.
  The Senate will vote on both of these nominees this week, and then we 
will continue working to confirm President Trump's outstanding judicial 
nominees. I look forward to supporting these nominees, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in voting to confirm them.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
