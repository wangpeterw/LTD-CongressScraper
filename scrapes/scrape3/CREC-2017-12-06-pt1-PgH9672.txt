                 AMERICANS DISAPPROVE OF MEDIA COVERAGE

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, according to a new Quinnipiac poll, 
58 percent of Americans disapprove of the media's coverage of the 
President. Only 38 percent approve. It is no surprise why the American 
people disapprove of the media's coverage.
  A few weeks ago, CBS Evening News ran a lengthy story mocking 
President Trump for taking a sip of water during the middle of a 
speech.
  To date, the broadcast networks of ABC, CBS, and NBC have spent over 
12 hours on an unproven Trump-Russia connection while only devoting 
4\1/2\ minutes to the Clinton uranium scandal involving Russia.
  Newsweek published a headline accusing Ivanka Trump of plagiarism 
because she used a sentence from a previous speech. Newsweek should 
check the dictionary. It is not plagiarism if you use your own words.
  These are only three of many examples that account for why 58 percent 
of Americans disapprove of the media's coverage. Their liberal bias is 
on display for all to see, and Americans are tired of it.
