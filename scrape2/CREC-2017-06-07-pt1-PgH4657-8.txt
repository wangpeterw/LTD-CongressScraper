                     PRESIDENT TRUMP IS COURAGEOUS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump 
last week courageously announced the withdrawal of the United States 
from the unconstitutional Paris accords, an unconstitutional treaty 
comprised of burdensome regulations destroying

jobs. I am grateful for President Trump's vision to create jobs for 
Americans.
  President Trump has been clear: his first priority is jobs. Sadly, 
job-destroying regulations from the Paris treaty would prevent American 
jobs while having no positive achievement for American families.
  Additionally, the Paris Agreement constitutes a treaty, a treaty that 
should have been submitted for approval to the Senate. Instead, the 
former President unconstitutionally adopted the treaty by executive 
order.
  The best way to achieve a cleaner environment is through limited 
government and free market economic growth, creating jobs--not Big 
Government mandates with higher taxes, destroying jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his 
actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on 
terrorism. Our sympathy to the citizens of London on the murderous 
terrorist attacks Saturday, as we cherish our shared heritage of D-Day 
to liberate Europe for freedom.
