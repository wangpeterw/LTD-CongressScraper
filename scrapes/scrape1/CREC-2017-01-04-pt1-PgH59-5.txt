                      SECOND AVENUE SUBWAY OPENING

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs.CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, residents in New 
York City had a special reason to celebrate as this new yearbegan. The 
very first new subway in over 60 years and the largest subway in the 
country opened its doors and carried passengersat 12 noon on New Year's 
Day. This new line is expected to carry over 200,000 travelers a day, 
reducing commute time, reducingcosts, operating with efficiency, and 
boosting small businesses.
  It is a project that has been on the books for over acentury and one 
that I fought for every single day that I have been in Congress. It is 
the gift that keeps on giving. It hasalready generated over 16,000 new 
jobs. It has spurred over $840 million in good wages. The regional plan 
says that it isresponsible for over $2.5 billion in new economic 
activity. They just opened their doors.
  Let's work together and supportother good, important infrastructure 
projects in our country. It is good for Americans; it is good for 
America.
