                            SCHUMER SHUTDOWN

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, during times of strife and stagnation, the 
most powerful tool we have at our disposal is the power of prayer.
  It is with that in mind that I offer my most heartfelt prayers for 
the men and women serving in uniform who are going without pay, and for 
the 9 million children forgoing access to critical healthcare during 
this Schumer shutdown.
  House Republicans fulfilled our bipartisan mission to responsibly 
fund the government, support our troops, and reauthorize CHIP for the 
children who rely on the program. The reason that Senator Schumer and 
Senate Democrats shut down the government is plain and simple. They 
value the demands of illegal immigrants more than they value the needs 
of American citizens.
  It is now the third day of the Schumer shutdown and that is 3 days 
too many in my book. I pray that the Senate Democrats who have shut 
down our government will soon see reason and will fund the government. 
Our citizens deserve better.
  End the Schumer shutdown.
