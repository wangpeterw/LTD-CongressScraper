                         TRIBUTE TO KYLE McKEE

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Kyle McKee, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Kyle is a graduate of Washington High School in Sioux Falls, SD. 
Currently, he is attending the University of Pennsylvania in 
Philadelphia, PA, where he is majoring in political science and 
chemistry. Kyle is a dedicated worker who has been committed to getting 
the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Kyle McKee for all of 
the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years 
to come.
