                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  Please send Your spirit of peace upon this assembly on a day of great 
political moment.
  The attention of millions of Americans is focused as the House 
considers legislation impacting the health care and coverage of so many 
citizens.
  On this National Day of Prayer, please attend to the supplications of 
Your people.
  May the deliberations of these days issue forth in legislation that 
indeed promotes the general welfare, one of the purposes of government 
articulated in the preamble to our Constitution.
  And may all that is done within the people's House this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
