                   NATIONAL RETIREMENT PLANNING WEEK

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the start of 
National Retirement Planning Week.
  For many, retirement can seem a long way off, far away, something not 
to worry about, in the future. But healthcare costs are rising, people 
are living longer, and a shift away from employer pensions means they 
will likely face more uncertainty in their retirement than ever before. 
Far too many, Mr. Speaker, will find themselves with too little in 
retirement to live comfortably.
  But planning early on and socking away a little now for the future 
will go a long way. Make a plan, start to save, and find out how your 
employer can help. As co-chair of the Financial Security and Life 
Insurance Caucus along with Richard Neal from Massachusetts, we are 
working together across the aisle to ensure that public policy 
encourages more savings, more planning, and more education to help 
families plan for the future in the event of disability, long-term 
medical care, or death.
  Mr. Speaker, 4 million Americans are retiring every year. That is 
10,000 people a day. National Retirement Planning Week is a chance to 
remind Minnesotans and all Americans that thinking about retirement 
should start in your twenties, not in your fifties.
