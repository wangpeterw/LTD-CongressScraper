       HONORING DONALD GILLEN, CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of one of my constituents, 
Donald Gillen, who is in Washington, D.C., today to receive the 
Congressional Gold Medal for his service to our Nation during World War 
II.
  Donald joined the Army on July 26, 1945. He was stationed at Camp 
O'Donnell in the Philippines from November 1946 through June 1947. As 
part of the 12th Philippine Scout Division, he became a company 
commander in the 57th Infantry Regiment.
  Donald moved to Belleville, Illinois, with his college sweetheart, 
Marilyn, to be close to his family, including four grandchildren. Now 
he is a guest staffer for the Belleville News-Democrat and supports his 
wife's singing in their church choir.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Donald to our Nation's 
Capitol and thanking him for his service. We are forever grateful.
