                      NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Career and 
Technical Education Caucus, I rise in recognition of National 
Apprenticeship Week.
  Apprenticeships, Mr. Speaker, provide valuable industry-driven job 
training for students of all ages, preparing them for careers in high-
skilled, high-demand fields. They are a proven workforce development 
tool that is crucial to meeting the demands of skilled trades, 
healthcare, and IT businesses, among many others, all of which 
currently face a significant shortage of qualified workers.
  Now, this summer, the House passed the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century Act with strong bipartisan 
support, which promotes work-based learning as a key component of CTE 
programs.
  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the 
Capitol tout the value of apprenticeships. Now, Mr. Speaker, it is so 
important that we back our words with action by passing the 
Strengthening CTE Act into law and providing robust funding for 
apprenticeship programs across the Nation.
  It is the right thing to do for our young people. It is the right 
thing to do for our workforce. It is the right thing to do for our 
Nation.
