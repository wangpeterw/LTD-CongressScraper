                UNITED NATIONS INTERIM FORCE IN LEBANON

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise 
awareness of the work Ambassador Nikki Haley is doing to increase 
transparency and accountability at the United Nations in many ways, but 
particularly as it relates to the U.N.'s Interim Force in Lebanon.
  This Force is tasked with an important responsibility: doing 
everything it can to disrupt and stop the illegal activities being 
carried out in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a group that seeks to destroy 
Israel and that receives funding from Iran.
  Part of this responsibility is ensuring weapons are not present near 
Lebanon's border with Israel. Unfortunately, for too long, the Force 
was not doing enough to acknowledge the presence of weapons, even as 
Hezbollah increased its weapons and put them on display for the media.
  At the behest of the United States, the Security Council has now 
agreed to increase the accountability of this Force, an important step 
for the security of one of our greatest allies, Israel, and for 
accountability and transparency at the United Nations.
