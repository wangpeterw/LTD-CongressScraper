Our troops have been facing a readiness crisis due to consistent underfunding.  This important legislation will begin to address the crisis with key investments in military readiness, and it fully funds a 2.4 percent, well-deserved pay raise for our troops.  In the 12th District of Georgia, we are at the forefront of cyber innovation, with the U.Army Cyber Center of Excellence located at Fort I am happy to say that the NDAA will fully fund cyber operations with an increase of $1.7 billion from fiscal year `17 and provides over $85 billion in military construction and Army Family Housing funds.  It is our constitutional obligation as Members of Congress to provide for the common defense of the I believe that, with the passage of the fiscal year `18 NDAA, we are meeting our obligation to keep America safe, close the critical readiness gap, and rebuild the 21st century military.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5770-9.txt,2239,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,13.0,May
1265,topic-id,152,"Mr.Speaker, this week recognizes National Police I would like to especially highlight the small but significant things officers do for our communities.  Police officers in Clearwater, Florida, surprised a 10-year-old robbery victim with lunch after his lunch money was stolen as he walked to school.  Hillsborough County sheriffs will drive homeless men and women to the Social Security office and help them with paperwork.  These are extraordinary individuals, Mr.There are countless examples of local law enforcement doing good every day.  This week we commemorate the fallen officers. Florida lost 11 officers in the past year, including Deputy Sheriff John Robert Kotfila from Hillsborough County who was killed after a collision with a wrong-way driver.  We also remember the Tarpon Springs officer, Officer Charles Kondek, who was fatally shot by a fugitive while on duty in 2014.  Thank you to our law enforcement officers in Florida and nationwide who keep us safe.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgH4203-3.txt,1838,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,16.0,May
1072,topic-id,597,"Mr.President, today I wish to speak about my vote yesterday on the nomination of Rod Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney General at the U.Department of I voted no on his nomination not because I think he is unqualified or because I think he is unfit for the job. He is neither of those things. Rather, I opposed his nomination because of the troubling actions the Justice Department is taking on criminal justice, civil rights, and immigration issues and because I firmly believe a special prosecutor is needed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election.  Since taking over as our Nation's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Sessions has indicated he wishes to roll back certain actions taken during the Obama administration. For instance, Attorney General Sessions is considering changes to existing Justice Department drug charging policies. I am concerned he will direct Federal prosecutors to increase the use of mandatory minimum penalties in low-level, nonviolent drug cases. Since 1980, our Federal prison population has increased by nearly 800 percent in large part because of the failed war on drugs and the use of mandatory minimums. Increasing the utilization of mandatory minimums will not make us safer or fix our broken criminal justice system. To the contrary, it will come at great cost--not only to American taxpayers, but to public safety, to families, and to confidence in our justice system. As Deputy Attorney General, Mr.Rosenstein will play a critical role in enacting those changes to existing charging policies.  Attorney General Sessions also recently indicated that the Justice Department may reverse its policy on the use of consent decrees to combat civil rights abuses by law enforcement when they occur. He has consistently criticized the use of consent decrees, and in his first major speech as Attorney General, he vowed to ``pull back'' on Federal suits against State and local police departments for civil rights abuses. There is no doubt that America's law enforcement community deserves our utmost respect and protection. These brave women and men have answered the call to serve and the vast majority of them serve with integrity. However, the Justice Department plays a critical role in assisting police departments struggling to combat systemic practices that unfairly target[[Page S2548]]minorities. Scaling back on the use of consent decrees means civil rights violations may not be remedied. As Deputy Attorney General, Mr.Rosenstein will play a critical role in reversing course on the use of consent decrees.  Finally, the pending investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election has caused deep concern and anxiety for many We owe it to the public to conduct an investigation that is beyond reproach and ensure that every person, regardless of their political affiliation, has confidence in the results no matter what they are. While Mr.Rosenstein is undoubtedly a man of integrity, such an investigation can only be conducted by an independent, special prosecutor. It concerns me that, in his confirmation hearing, Mr.Rosenstein would not commit to appointing such a person.  Mr.Rosenstein has served his country with honor and distinction. He is well respected on both sides of the aisle. In most circumstances, I believe I would have supported his nomination. However, the disturbing agenda on civil and human rights of the Trump administration and the actions Attorney General Sessions continues to advance at the Justice Department and Mr.Rosenstein's responses to questions regarding this agenda at his confirmation hearing leave me deeply troubled about the role he will play as the second highest ranking individual at the For those reasons, I voted no on his nomination to be Deputy Attorney  ",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2547-2.txt,2194,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,26.0,June
1175,topic-id,9910,"Mr.President, this explanation reflects the status of negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on  The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement of a conference committee. The explanation comprises three parts: an overview of the application of the annex to accompany this statement, unclassified congressional direction, and a section-by-section analysis of the legislative text.  I ask unanimous consent that the joint explanatory statement for the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    DIVISION N--INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017       The following is the explanation of the Intelligence      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.       This explanation reflects the status of negotiations and      disposition of issues reached between the House Permanent      Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select      Committee on Intelligence (hereinafter, ``the Agreement'').      The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to      the implementation of this Act as if it were a joint      explanatory statement of a conference committee.       The explanation comprises three parts: an overview of the      application of the annex to accompany this statement;      unclassified congressional direction; and a section-by-     section analysis of the legislative text.              Part I: Application of the Classified Annex       The classified nature of U.intelligence activities      prevents the congressional intelligence committees from      publicly disclosing many details concerning the conclusions      and recommendations of the Therefore, a classified      Schedule of Authorizations and a classified annex have been      prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of the      congressional intelligence committees' actions. The Agreement      authorizes the Intelligence Community (IC) to obligate and      expend funds not altered or modified by the classified      Schedule of Authorizations as requested in the President's      budget, subject to modification under applicable      reprogramming procedures.       The classified annex is the result of negotiations between      the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the      Senate Select Committee on It reconciles the      differences between the committees' respective versions of      the bill for the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the[[Page S2748]]     Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP) for Fiscal Year      2017. The Agreement also makes recommendations for the      Military Intelligence Program (MIP), and the Information      Systems Security Program (ISSP), consistent with the National      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, and provides      certain direction for these two programs.       The Agreement supersedes the classified annexes to the      reports accompanying: H.5077, as passed by the House on      May 24, 2016; H.6393, as passed by the House on November      20, 2016; H.6480, as passed by the House on December 8,      2016; 3017, as reported by the Senate Select Committee on      Intelligence on June 6, 2016; and 133, as reported by the      Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on January 20, 2017.      All references to the House-passed and Senate-reported      annexes are solely to identify the heritage of specific      provisions.       The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated      into the bill pursuant to Section 102. It has the status of      law. The classified annex supplements and adds detail to      clarify the authorization levels found in the bill and the      classified Schedule of The classified annex      shall have the same legal force as the report to accompany      the bill.          Part II: Select Unclassified Congressional Direction     Managing intelligence community personnel       This Agreement by the congressional intelligence committees      accepts the Senate's recommendations that IC elements should      build, develop, and maintain a workforce appropriately      balanced among its civilian, military and contractor      workforce sectors to meet the missions assigned to it in law      and by the president. The Agreement recognizes that the size      and shape of the IC's multi-sector workforce should be based      on mission needs, and encourages the IC to adjust its      reliance on contractors when appropriate, both as a matter of      general policy and as a way to conserve resources. The      flexibility afforded in this provision should support this      position. In addition, section 103 provides an increase in      the number of civilian personnel authorized in the Schedule      of Authorizations for the purposes of such contractor      conversions in the interim for the remainder of fiscal year      2017. Nothing precludes the Congress from addressing the end      strength for any element or office of the IC in the annual      authorization bills.       Therefore, the committees direct that the ODNI provide the      congressional intelligence committees briefings on the      workforce initiative as directed in section 306, beginning      July 1, 2017, and each 120 days thereafter until July 1,      2018, with benchmarks and milestones, for IC elements to      manage a multi-sector workforce without personnel ceilings      starting in fiscal year 2019. The ODNI, in coordination with      the IC elements, shall establish a common methodology for      collecting and reporting data, and include new exhibits in      the annual congressional budget justification books that      display full-time equivalents (government civilians, core      contractors, non-core contractors, and military personnel),      by program, expenditure center and project.       In the absence of authorized position ceiling levels,      agencies will be bound to authorized and appropriated      personal services funding levels.       Further, the transfer of non-personal services funding in      below-threshold reprogramming is a concern to the committees.      Therefore, the committees direct agencies to provide a      written notification to the committees of any realignment      and/or reprogramming of funding between personal services and      non-personal services.     Commercial Geospatial Intelligence Strategy       The congressional intelligence committees applaud the      National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for issuing its      October 2015 Commercial Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)      Strategy, which states a goal of fostering a ``more diverse,      resilient, agile, and responsive GEOINT program that provides      seamless user access to the best mix of commercial GEOINT . .      . to fulfill National System for Geospatial-Intelligence      (NSG) and Allied System for Geospatial-Intelligence (ASG)      mission needs.'' The committees also find merit in the NGA's      ``GEOINT Pathfinder'' project, which seeks to maximize the      use of unclassified and commercially available data sources      that can be easily and rapidly shared with a variety of      military, United States and allied government, and non-     government customers, and supports the project's continuation      and expansion.       The committees further commend the NGA for pursuing new      methods of intelligence collection and analysis to inform,      complement, and add to its support of warfighter requirements      by looking to emerging commercial technology providers,      including small satellite companies, which hold the promise      of rapid technological innovation and potentially significant      future cost savings to the U.taxpayer. The committees      further encourage the Director of the NGA to ensure      sufficient funding is available to acquire new, unclassified      sources, including commercial satellite imagery providing      unprecedented global persistence, as well as products and      services that provide information and context about changes      relevant to geospatial intelligence. The committees also      encourage the NGA to pursue new business models, including      commercial acquisition practices, to enable the NGA's access      to data, products, and services in ways consistent with best      commercial practices.       The committees fully support the NGA's course of action in      partnering with the commercial GEOINT industry to meet future      warfighter intelligence requirements, while recognizing the      need to take appropriate steps to protect national security,      and encourage the Director of the NGA and the Under Secretary      of Defense for Intelligence to keep the committees informed      of their progress in implementing this strategy. Therefore,      this Agreement directs the Department of Defense (DoD), in      building future-year budgets, to ensure continued funding is      provided for implementation, through at least Fiscal Year      2021, of the Commercial Geospatial Intelligence Strategy      issued by the NGA in October 2015.     Space Launch Facilities       The congressional intelligence committees continue to      believe it is critical to preserve a variety of launch range      capabilities to support national security space missions.      Spaceports or launch and range complexes may provide      capabilities to reach mid-to-low or polar-to-high inclination      orbits. The committees believe an important component of this      effort may be state-owned and operated spaceports that are      commercially licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration,      which leverage non-federal public and private investments to      bolster U.launch capabilities. Additionally, the      committees believe that these facilities may be able to      provide additional flexibility and resilience to the Nation's      launch infrastructure, especially as the nation considers      concepts such as the reconstitution of satellites to address      the growing foreign counterspace threat. The committees note      recent testimony by the Chief of Staff of the U.Air Force,      General Mark Welsh, who stated,       As we look at this space enterprise and how we do it      differently in the future, as we look more at disaggregation,      microsats, cube sats, small sats, things that don't have to      go from a large launch complex all the time, I think      proliferating launch complexes is probably going to be a      natural outshoot of this. I think it's commercially viable,      it may be a way for companies to get into the launch business      who could not afford to get into it or don't see a future in      it and for large national security space launches, but I      think this has got to be part of the strategy that this whole      national team puts together as we look to the future.       Therefore, the Agreement directs the IC, in partnership      with the U.Air Force, to consider the role and      contribution of spaceports or launch and range complexes to      our national security space launch capacity, and directs the      Office of the Director of National Intelligence, in      consultation with the Department of Defense and the U.Air      Force, to brief the congressional intelligence committees on      their plans to utilize such facilities within 90 days of      enactment of this     National Reconnaissance Office Workforce Optimization          Strategy       The congressional intelligence committees have had      longstanding interest in, and support for, a permanent      government cadre to provide the National Reconnaissance      Office (NRO) with a stable, expert acquisition workforce. The      committees applaud the substantial progress that the NRO has      made in the past year in this regard. The committees have      parallel interests in providing the IC with flexibility to      manage a multi-sector workforce and in continuing the      reduction in the reliance on contractors.       Therefore, the Agreement directs the NRO to conduct a      workforce review to optimize the mix between government      civilians and contractors and report to the committees with a      strategy within 90 days of enactment of this     Guidance and reporting requirement regarding interactions          between the intelligence community and entertainment          industry.       The congressional intelligence committees believe that      there are important, valid reasons for elements of the IC to      engage with the entertainment industry, among other things to      ensure the correction of inaccuracies, demonstrate the IC's      commitment to transparency, and to ensure that the IC      recruits and retains highly qualified personnel to the      fullest extent possible. The committees further believe that      IC engagement with the entertainment industry should be      conducted in the most cost effective and deliberate fashion      possible, while ensuring that classified information is      protected from unauthorized disclosure.       These engagements--some of which have been described in      partially-declassified inspector general reports--cost      taxpayer dollars, raise potential ethics concerns, increase      the risk of disclosure of classified information, and consume      the time and attention of IC personnel responsible for United      States national security. Neither the production of      entertainment nor the self-promotion of IC entities are      legitimate purposes for these engagements.     Review of the National Intelligence University        The National Intelligence University (NIU) has made      significant progress in recent years in its transition from a      defense intelligence college to a national intelligence      university that provides advanced education in a classified      format. Such advanced education is integral to making      intelligence a profession with recognized standards for      performance and ethics and fostering an integrated IC      workforce. While progress has been significant since the      Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and Secretary of      Defense[[Page S2749]]     agreed to redesignate Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA)      National Defense Intelligence College as NIU in 2011, the      institution must continue to adapt to functioning as a      university with a robust research agenda, and to serving the      entire IC, not just elements of       Fiscal years 2017 and 2018 are of great significance for      NIU, as it moves its principal facility to the IC Campus at      Bethesda, completes activities associated with its 2018      decennial regional accreditation reaffirmation, and receives      a new president. The congressional intelligence committees      believe that these developments position NIU to make further      progress in its vision to become the center of academic life      for the       To guide these next steps, the Agreement directs DIA, in      coordination with ODNI and the Office of the Under Secretary      of Defense for Intelligence, to, no later than 30 days after      enactment of this Act, select a five member, external, and      independent panel to conduct a review of The panel shall      submit a report detailing the results of such review to the      congressional intelligence and defense committees within 180      days of enactment of this The panel should be composed      of recognized academics, personnel from other DoD joint      professional military education institutions, national      security experts, and at least one member of NIU's Board of            This review and the resulting report shall, among other      things, assess:       (1) Methods for ensuring a student body that is more      representative of all IC elements;       (2) Incentives for IC elements to send personnel to NIU to      earn a degree or certificate, to include designating      attendance at NIU as positions reimbursable by ODNI and      requiring IC elements to employ the workforce concept of      ``float'' for personnel enrolled in higher-education      programs;       (3) How certificate programs align with NIU's unique value      as an institution of advanced intelligence education;       (4) Methods to enhance NIU's research program, to include      publication of a journal, hosting of conferences and other      collaborative fora, and more formalized relationships with      intelligence studies scholars;       (5) Whether and how educational components of other IC      elements could provide educational offerings as part of the      NIU curriculum;       (6) Potential advantages and risks associated with      alternative governance models for NIU, to include moving it      under the auspices of ODNI; and       (7) The feasibility and resource constraints of NIU      tailoring degree offerings to meet the needs of IC personnel      at different stages in their careers, similar to DoD's joint      professional military education model.     Cost of living consideration       The congressional intelligence committees are concerned      with the high cost of living for military, civilian, and      contractor personnel at overseas Combatant Command      intelligence centers. Although the committees recognize the      benefits of co-locating intelligence analysts with the      operational commander, the intelligence centers for both U.     European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S Africa Command (USAFRICOM)      are located over 600 miles from their Combatant Command      headquarters. Combatant Commanders based in the United States      regularly communicate with forward deployed units, and the      USEUCOM and USAFRICOM intelligence centers have developed      mechanisms to effectively employ various teleconferencing and      virtual communication tools to ensure collaboration across      large distances.       The congressional intelligence committees are concerned      that despite the utility of these virtual collaboration      tools, DoD has not taken action to reduce the number of      intelligence personnel stationed in high cost of living      areas. These costs can exceed $65,000 per person, per year in      annual cost of living allowances compared to the continental      United States (CONUS) expenses. The additional costs      associated with stationing intelligence personnel in high-     cost overseas locations detract from other critical      intelligence priorities. The committees are further concerned      that DoD does not adequately account for the long-run expense      of high costs of living when selecting locations for      intelligence facilities.       Therefore, the Agreement directs the DIA to evaluate      alternate mechanisms for staffing overseas Combatant Command      intelligence centers, particularly those that are not co-     located with Combatant Command headquarters, and to identify      cost-savings opportunities by shifting personnel to lower      cost locations, including in the continental United     Defense Intelligence Agency education opportunities       DIA presently allows DIA employees to receive pay for a      single year only while attending certain graduate degree      programs on a full-time basis. Employees may pursue such      opportunities at the National Intelligence University and      similar institutions; and, in certain circumstances, also at      public and private civilian universities. However, the one-     year limit discourages DIA personnel from pursuing multi-year      graduate degree programs. Expanding DIA's program to allow      highly qualified DIA employees to pursue multi-year graduate      degree programs from accredited civilian universities would      further improve retention, recruitment, and foster diversity      of thought at       Therefore, the Agreement directs DIA, no later than 180      days after the enactment of this Act, to:       (1) Provide for and fund a program that allows for DIA      employees to attend civilian graduate degree programs for up      to two years each, based on the standard length of the      relevant program, provided that:       (a) Where DIA deems appropriate, employees may pursue      academic programs extending beyond two years. Consistent with      current practices, the program should be made available to at      least five employees each year, with each employee receiving      a full-time salary while participating in the program; and       (b) Each DIA participant shall be subject to any program      approvals, service obligations, repayment obligations, and      other requirements pertaining to academic programs, as      prescribed by applicable laws and policies.       (2) Brief the congressional intelligence committees on the      status of the program's implementation.     Mental health prevalence       The congressional intelligence committees are committed to      supporting the men and women of the IC, who bravely risk      their lives serving their country as civilians in conflict      zones and other dangerous locations around the world. These      individuals often serve next to their military counterparts      in areas of active hostilities. As such, they are often      exposed to many of the emotional stresses generally      associated with a tour of duty abroad. The committees believe      there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in the pre- and      post-deployment mental health and wellness services available      to civilian employees.       Therefore, the Agreement directs the National Security      Agency (NSA), NGA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and      DIA, no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act,      to provide a joint briefing to the congressional intelligence      committees on the mental health screenings and related      services that these agencies offer employees, both before and      after they deploy to combat zones. Such briefing shall      include a description of:       (1) Existing services available;       (2) Agency resources for and analysis of these services,      including the frequency of use by employees compared to the      total number returning from deployment; and       (3) How agencies with deployed civilian employees are      sharing best practices and leveraging services or resources      outside their agencies.     Review of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence       It has been more than ten years since the Congress      established the position of the Director of National      Intelligence (DNI) in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2004, building on its predecessor, the      Director of Central Given this experience and      the evolving security environment, the committees believe it      appropriate to review the DNI's roles, missions and functions      and adapt its authorities, organization and resources as      needed.       Therefore, the Agreement directs the President to form an      independent, external panel of at least five individuals with      significant intelligence and national security expertise to      review ODNI's roles, missions and functions and make      recommendations, as needed, regarding its authorities,      organization and resources. The panel shall:       (1) Evaluate ODNI's ability to fulfill the responsibilities      assigned to it in law given its current scope and structure;       (2) Assess whether any roles and responsibilities currently      assigned to the DNI could be more effectively or efficiently      executed by other IC components or government agencies      outside the IC;       (3) Analyze the personnel, funding, and authorities      required for each component of ODNI to perform each of its      assigned responsibilities;       (4) Evaluate the organizational structure of ODNI;       (5) Review the size, role, purpose and function of ODNI's      mission centers;       (6) Assess the value of the national intelligence manager      construct;       (7) Review the size and mix of the ODNI workforce--to      include the ratio between cadre and detailees, the balance      between government and contractors, and grade structure--to      perform its roles, missions and functions; and       (8) Make recommendations regarding the above.       The Agreement directs the President, no later than 30 days      after the enactment of this Act, to select the individuals      who will serve on the external panel and notify the      congressional intelligence committees of such selection.       In addition, the Agreement directs the panel, no later than      180 days after the enactment of this Act, to provide a report      on this review to the congressional intelligence committees.      This report shall be unclassified, but may contain a      classified annex. The Agreement further directs ODNI to      reimburse the Executive Office of the President for any costs      associated with the review.     Improving pre-publication review       The congressional intelligence committees are concerned      that current and former IC personnel have published written      material without completing mandatory pre-publication review      procedures or have rejected changes required by the review      process, resulting in the publication of classified      information. The committees are particularly[[Page S2750]]     troubled by press reports suggesting that officials are      unaware of the existence or scope of pre-publication review      requirements.       The committees are also aware of the perception that the      pre-publication review process can be unfair, untimely, and      unduly onerous--and that these burdens may be at least      partially responsible for some individuals ``opting out'' of      the mandatory review process. The committees further      understand that IC agencies' pre-publication review      mechanisms vary, and that there is no binding, IC-wide      guidance on the subject.       The committees believe that all IC personnel must be made      aware of pre-publication review requirements and that the      review process must yield timely, reasoned, and      impartial decisions that are subject to appeal. The      committees also believe that efficiencies can be      identified by limiting the information subject to pre-     publication review, to the fullest extent possible, to      only those materials that might reasonably contain or be      derived from classified information obtained during the      course of an individual's association with the In      short, the pre-publication review process should be      improved to better incentivize compliance and to ensure      that personnel fulfill their commitments.       Therefore, the Agreement directs that, no later than 180      days after the enactment of this Act, the DNI shall issue an      IC-wide policy regarding pre-publication review. The DNI      shall transmit this policy to the congressional intelligence      committees concurrently with its issuance. The policy should      require each IC agency to develop and maintain a pre-     publication policy that contains, at a minimum, the following      elements:       (1) Identification of the individuals subject to pre-     publication review requirements (``covered individuals'');       (2) Guidance on the types of information that must be      submitted for pre-publication review, including works (a)      unrelated to an individual's IC employment; or (b) published      in cooperation with a third party, e.g.--       (a) Authored jointly by covered individuals and third      parties;       (b) Authored by covered individuals but published under the      name of a third party; or       (c) Authored by a third party but with substantial input      from covered individuals.       (3) Guidance on a process by which covered individuals can      participate in pre-publication reviews, and communicate      openly and frequently with reviewers;       (4) Requirements for timely responses, as well as reasoned      edits and decisions by reviewers;       (5) Requirements for a prompt and transparent appeal      process;       (6) Guidelines for the assertion of interagency equities in      pre-publication review;       (7) A summary of the lawful measures each agency may take      to enforce its policy, to include civil and criminal      referrals; and       (8) A description of procedures for post-publication review      of documents that are alleged or determined to reveal      classified information but were not submitted for pre-     publication review.       Additionally, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180      days after the enactment of this Act, to provide to the      congressional intelligence committees a report on the      adequacy of IC information technology efforts to improve and      expedite pre-publication review processes, and the resources      needed to ensure that IC elements can meet this direction.       The Agreement further directs the DNI, no later than 270      days after the enactment of this Act, to certify to the      congressional intelligence committees that IC elements' pre-     publication review policies, non-disclosure agreements, and      any other agreements imposing pre-publication review      obligations reflect the policy described above.     Student loan debt report       IC components need to be able to recruit talented young      professionals. However, the soaring cost of college and post-     graduate education in the United States is causing many young      people to forgo public service in favor of career      opportunities with more competitive pay or loan forgiveness      benefits.       Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180      days after the enactment of this Act, to provide a report to      the congressional intelligence committees on programs that      seek to help IC personnel manage student loan debt. The      report shall include details about each IC element's program,      including loan forgiveness, loan repayment, and financial      counseling programs; efforts to inform prospective and      current employees about such programs; and the number of      employees who use such programs. The report shall also      include an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of creating      new programs and expanding existing programs, and shall      identify any barriers to the establishment of IC-wide      programs.     Workforce development partnership       The congressional intelligence committees have long      promoted novel recruiting, hiring, and retention practices,      especially with respect to highly expert, highly sought-after      Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) students      and professionals. Despite these efforts, the IC continues to      struggle with meeting STEM recruitment, hiring, and retention      goals inside the       The committees are therefore encouraged to learn that the      IC is considering new and creative practices in this regard.      For example, the committees were intrigued by the Pacific      Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) budding Workforce      Development Partnership with the Partnerships like this      may allow IC agencies to leverage PNNL's robust employee      recruiting network and seek out STEM students who might not      otherwise consider IC employment.       Similarly, to address concerns that potential hires will      accept other job offers while awaiting clearances, NGA has a      program to allow interim hires to work on unclassified      projects until clearances are adjudicated. In addition,      several IC agencies have instituted a unique pay scale for      their junior STEM workforce. The committees recognize the      benefits of these initiatives, and believes that such efforts      could have wider applicability across the       Therefore, the Agreement directs the DNI Chief Human      Capital Officer, no later than 180 days after the enactment      of this Act, to provide to the congressional intelligence      committees an interagency briefing on new approaches,      including outreach and advertising, the IC is considering or      conducting to attract a diverse, robust Science, Technology,      Engineering, and Math and information technology workforce to      meet the increasing demands in the     Distributed Common Ground/Surface System-Army       The congressional intelligence committees believe the      Distributed Common Ground/Surface System-Army (DCGS-A)      provides operational and tactical commanders with enhanced,      state-of-the-art intelligence, surveillance, and      reconnaissance (ISR) tasking, processing, exploitation, and      dissemination capabilities and connectivity to the defense      intelligence information enterprise. DCGS-A is a critical      tool for enabling military intelligence warfighters to      process, fuse, and exploit data. In the past, the Army has      struggled to keep pace for pre-deployment and in-theater      training for DCGS-However, training for military      intelligence analysts must be prioritized in the pre-     deployment readiness cycle to ensure that those using this      intelligence tool can effectively utilize its capabilities.       The Army has fielded over 95 percent of DCGS-A Increment 1      systems, with mixed results and often negative feedback from      the users. The Army is in the process of fielding Increment      1, Release 2, which will address many of the initial concerns      and deficiencies of Increment 1. The committees remain      concerned that the Army has not sufficiently planned for user      training in support of the release of Increment 1, Release 2      to operational users.       Therefore, the congressional intelligence committees      request that the Army, no later than 90 days after the      enactment of this Act, submit a plan to the congressional      intelligence and defense committees on how the Army will      fully incorporate Distributed Common Ground/Surface System-     Army (DCGS-A) training into the readiness cycle for Army      personnel. The plan should specifically address any lessons      learned from the fielding of DCGS-A Increment 1 and any      ongoing corrective actions to improve the roll-out of      Increment 1, Release 2.     Common controller for unmanned aircraft systems       The congressional intelligence committees support the      Army's efforts to develop a common controller for the RQ-7A/B      Shadow and the RQ-11B Raven tactical unmanned aerial      vehicles. However, the committees are concerned that the Army      is not collaborating with the Marine Corps on similar efforts      to develop a ground controller for the Marine Corps family of      tactical unmanned aerial systems (UAS), including the RQ-11B      Raven, the RQ-12A Wasp, and the RQ-20A       Therefore, the Agreement requests that the Army and the      Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA), no later than 90      days after the enactment of this Act, jointly submit a report      to the congressional intelligence and defense committees on      the feasibility of developing a common controller for all      Brigade and Below unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) airframes,      as well as U.Marine Corps small unit The report      should address the potential performance and operational      benefits of a common controller, anticipated development      costs, and anticipated life-cycle cost savings of a common      controller.     Review of dual-hatting relationship       The congressional intelligence committees support further      evaluation of the dual-hatting of a single individual as both      Commander of U.Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director of      the National Security Agency (DIRNSA).       Therefore, the Agreement directs the Secretary of Defense,      no later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to      provide to the congressional intelligence and defense      committees a briefing that reviews and provides an assessment      of the dual-hatting of DIRNSA and Commander, This      briefing should address:       (1) Roles and responsibilities, including intelligence      authorities, of USCYBERCOM and NSA;       (2) Assessment of the current impact of the dual-hatting      relationship, including advantages and disadvantages;       (3) Plans and recommendations on courses of action that      would be necessary to end the dual-hatting of DIRNSA and      Commander, USCYBERCOM, which satisfy Section 1642 of the      conference report accompanying 2943, the National Defense      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017;       (4) Suggested timelines for carrying out such courses of      action;       (5) Recommendations for any changes in law that would be      required by the end of dual-batting; and[[Page S2751]]       (6) Any additional topics as identified by the intelligence      and defense committees.       The congressional intelligence committees further believe      that a larger organizational review of NSA should be      conducted with respect to the eventual termination of the      dual-hatting relationship. The congressional intelligence      committees seek to promote the efficient and effective      execution of NSA's national intelligence mission.      Specifically, the congressional intelligence committees      believe that the organization of NSA should be examined to      account for the evolution of its mission since its      establishment, the current structure of the intelligence      community, and the fact that the NSA is predominantly funded      through the       Therefore, the Agreement further directs the DNI, no later      than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, to conduct an      assessment and provide a briefing to the congressional      intelligence committees on options to better align the      structure, budgetary procedures, and oversight of NSA with      its national intelligence mission in the event of a      termination of the dual-batting relationship. This briefing      should include:       (1) An assessment of the feasibility of transitioning NSA      to civilian leadership appointed by the DNI in lieu of      military leadership appointed by the Secretary of Defense;       (2) How NSA could be organizationally separated from DoD if      USCYBERCOM were elevated to become a unified combatant      command; and       (3) Any challenges, such as those requiring changes in law,      associated with such a separation.     Acquisition security improvement       The congressional intelligence committees remain concerned      about supply chain and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the      The committees believe the IC should implement a more      comprehensive approach to address these vulnerabilities,      particularly during the acquisition process. However, ICD      801, the IC guideline governing the acquisition process, is      outdated and must be revised to reflect current risks. In      particular, despite issuance of ICD 731, Supply Chain Risk      Management, in 2013, ICD 801 has not been updated to reflect      this policy nor does it include consideration of      cybersecurity vulnerabilities and mitigation.       Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180      days after the enactment of this Act, to review and consider      amendments to Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 801 to      better reflect and anticipate supply chain and cybersecurity      risks and threats, as well as to outline policies to mitigate      both risks and threats. In particular, the review should      examine whether to:       (1) Expand risk management criteria in the acquisition      process to include cyber and supply chain threats;       (2) Require counterintelligence and security assessments as      part of the acquisition and procurement process;       (3) Propose and adopt new education requirements for      acquisition professionals on cyber and supply chain threats;      and       (4) Factor in the cost of cyber and supply chain security.       The Agreement further directs ODNI, no later than 210 days      after the enactment of this Act, to provide to the      congressional intelligence committees a report describing the      review, including ODNI's process for considering amendments      to ICD 801, and specifically addressing ODNI's analysis and      conclusions with respect to paragraphs (1) through (4) above.     Cyber information sharing and customer feedback       The congressional intelligence committees commend NSA's new      policies and procedures to facilitate greater information      sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures      with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the      unclassified level.       With the recent enactment of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015,      which encourages greater information sharing between private      sector stakeholders, as well as with government entities, the      committees believe the next step is to ensure the entire IC      is working to disseminate timely, actionable information to      private sector stakeholders so they can better protect their      information technology networks. The vast majority of U.     networks reside in the private sector, and it is good      governance to ensure that those networks are safe and secure      for the general public.       The committees appreciate that the IC has begun efforts to      increase unclassified cyber threat sharing. Because an      increase in the quantity of reporting does not necessarily      indicate effectiveness or usefulness, this Committee      continues to monitor the quality of the information      distributed.       Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 120      days after the enactment of this Act, to brief the      congressional intelligence committees on IC-wide efforts to      share more information with the Department of Homeland      Security (DHS) for further dissemination to the private      sector. This briefing shall specifically address types of      information shared, metrics on output, tabulation of low      output producing agencies, recommendations on how low output      agencies can increase sharing, timeliness of information      shared, and average total time it takes for information to      transit the system.       The Agreement also directs ODNI, in coordination with the      DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), to conduct a      survey of government and private sector participants of the      National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center      (NCCIC). The survey shall be anonymous, provide an accurate      assessment of the usefulness and timeliness of the data      received, and determine if customers are satisfied with      intelligence briefings on threat actors impacting their      specific industry. The Agreement further directs ODNI, no      later than one year after the enactment of this Act, to      provide to the congressional intelligence and homeland      security committees an unclassified report detailing the      results of this survey.     Department of Homeland Security utilization of National Labs          expertise       The congressional intelligence committees believe that the      Department of Energy (DOE) National Labs represent a unique      and invaluable resource for the government and the IC in      particular.       Therefore, the Agreement directs, no later than 180 days      after the enactment of this Act, DHS I&A, in coordination      with DOE Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (DOE-     IN), to provide to the congressional intelligence committees      a report on the current utilization of Department of Energy      (DOE) National Labs expertise by DHS I&This report should      address opportunities to increase DHS I&A's utilization of      cybersecurity expertise of the National Labs as well as the      budgetary implications of taking advantage of these potential      opportunities.     Cybersecurity courses for Centers of Academic Excellence       The congressional intelligence committees are concerned by      a recent analysis from a security firm, which determined that      not one of the nation's leading undergraduate computer      science programs requires students to take a cybersecurity      course before graduating. Cybersecurity depends on IC      professionals having a strong understanding of the cyber      threat and how to mitigate it--which in turn requires a      strong academic background. NSA and DHS cosponsor the Centers      of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense program, which      includes an emphasis on basic cybersecurity. Nevertheless,      even some CAE-designated institutions lack cybersecurity      course prerequisites in their computer science curricula.       Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180      days after the enactment of this Act, to submit to the      congressional intelligence committees a report on improving      cybersecurity training within NIP-funded undergraduate and      graduate computer science programs. The report should      specifically address:       (1) The potential advantages and disadvantages of      conditioning an institution's receipt of such funds on its      computer science program's requiring cybersecurity as a      precondition to graduation;       (2) How Centers of Academic Excellence programs might      bolster cybersecurity educational requirements; and       (3) Recommendations to support the goal of ensuring that      federally-funded computer science programs properly equip      students to confront future cybersecurity challenges. Part III: Section-by-section Analysis and Explanation of Legislative                                   Text       The following is a section-by-section analysis and      explanation of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal      Year 2017.                    TITLE I--INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments,      agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes      appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related      activities for Fiscal Year 2017.     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations       Section 102 provides that the details of the amounts      authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and      intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel      levels by program for Fiscal Year 2017 are contained in the      classified Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified      Schedule of Authorizations shall be made available to the      Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of      Representatives and to the     Section 103. Personnel ceiling adjustments       Section 103 provides that the DNI may authorize employment      of civilian personnel in Fiscal Year 2017 in excess of the      number of authorized positions by an amount not exceeding      three percent of the total limit applicable to each IC      element under Section 102, and ten percent of the number of      civilian personnel authorized under such schedule for the      purposes of contractor conversions. The DNI may do so only if      necessary to the performance of important intelligence      functions.     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence      Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the      authorized personnel levels for the elements within the ICMA      for Fiscal Year 2017. TITLE II--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY SYSTEM     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of      $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2017 for the Central      Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability           TITLE III--GENERAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MATTERS       Section 301. Restriction on conduct of intelligence      activities.[[Page S2752]]       Section 301 provides that the authorization of      appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute      authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that      is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of      the United     Section 302. Increase in employee compensation and benefits          authorized by law.       Section 302 provides that funds authorized to be      appropriated by the Act for salary, pay, retirement, and      other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such      additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for      increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.     Section 303. Support to nonprofit organizations assisting          intelligence community employees.       Section 303 permits the DNI to engage in fundraising in an      official capacity for the benefit of nonprofit organizations      that provide support to surviving family members of a      deceased employee of an element of the IC or otherwise      provide support for the welfare, education, or recreation of      IC employees, former employees, or their family members.      Section 303 requires the DNI to issue regulations ensuring      that the fundraising authority is exercised consistent with      all relevant ethical limitations and principles. Section 303      further requires that the DNI and the Director of the CIA      notify the congressional intelligence committees within seven      days after they engage in such fundraising.     Section 304. Promotion of science, technology, engineering,          and mathematics education in the intelligence community.       Section 304 requires the DNI to submit a five-year      investment strategy for outreach and recruiting efforts in      the fields of science, technology, engineering, and      mathematics (STEM), to include cybersecurity and computer      literacy. Section 304 further requires elements of the IC to      submit STEM investment plans supporting this strategy for      each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022, along with the      materials justifying the budget request of each element for      these STEM recruiting and outreach activities.     Section 305. Retention of employees of the intelligence          community who have science, technology, engineering, or          mathematics expertise.       Section 305 authorizes a new payscale to permit salary      increases for employees in the IC with STEM backgrounds.      Section 305 also requires notifications to individual      employees if a position is removed from this new payscale.      Section 305 further requires the head of each IC element to      submit to the congressional intelligence committees a report      on the new rates of pay and number of positions authorized      under this payscale.     Section 306. Management of intelligence community personnel       Section 306 prohibits the Congress's use of government      personnel ceilings in the management of the IC workforce      starting in Fiscal Year 2019. Section 306 requires the DNI to      provide briefings on the IC's initiative to maintain both      employees and contractors within the IC, as well as both a      briefing and a report on the methodology, cost analysis tool,      and implementation plans. Section 306 further requires the IC      IG to provide a written report on the accuracy of IC      workforce data. This section will align the IC's management      of personnel consistent with the practices of the Department      of Defense and other federal agencies.     Section 307. Modifications to certain requirements for          construction of facilities       Section 307 clarifies that the requirement to notify the      congressional intelligence committees of improvement projects      with an estimated cost greater than $1,000,000 for facilities      used primarily by IC personnel includes repairs and      modifications.     Section 308. Guidance and reporting requirement regarding          interactions between the intelligence community and          entertainment industry.       Section 308 requires the DNI to issue public guidance      regarding engagements by elements of the Intelligence      Community with entertainment industry entities. The guidance      will include DNI providing an annual report to the      congressional intelligence committees detailing interactions      between the IC and the entertainment industry. Section 308      also requires the report to include a description of the      nature, duration, costs, benefits, and results of each      engagement, as well as a determination that each engagement      did not result in a disclosure of classified information and      whether any information was declassified for the disclosure.      Section 308 further requires that before an IC element may      engage with the entertainment industry, the head of that      element must approve the proposed engagement. Contractual      relationships for professional services and technical      expertise are exempt from these reporting requirements.     Section 309. Protections for independent inspectors general          of elements of the intelligence community.       Section 309 requires the ODNI to develop and implement a      uniform policy for each identified Inspector General (IG)      office in the IC to better ensure their independence. The      provision specifies elements to be incorporated in such a      policy including (a) guidance regarding conflicts of      interest, (b) standards to ensure independence, and (c) a      waiver provision. Section 309 further prohibits the DNI from      requiring an employee of an OIG to rotate to a position in      the element for which such office conducts oversight.     Section 310. Congressional oversight of policy directives and          guidance.       Section 310 requires the DNI to submit to the congressional      intelligence committees notifications and copies of any      classified or unclassified Presidential Policy Directive,      Presidential Policy Guidance, or other similar policy      document issued by the President which assigns tasks, roles,      or responsibilities to the IC, within the specified      timeframes. Section 310 further requires the Director to      notify the congressional intelligence committees of guidance      to implement such policies.     Section 311. Notification of memoranda of understanding.       Section 311 requires the head of each element of the IC to      submit to the congressional intelligence committees copies of      each memorandum of understanding or other agreement regarding      significant operational activities or policy entered into      between or among such element and any other entity or      entities of the federal government within specified      timeframes.       Section 311 does not require an IC element to submit to the      congressional intelligence committees any memorandum or      agreement that is solely administrative in nature, including      a memorandum or agreement regarding joint duty or other      routine personnel assignments.

This section is not      intended to limit the ability of the DNI to transmit      supplementary materials to the congressional intelligence      committees along with the threat assessments.       Section 402 also directs the DNI to provide the committees      with impact statements when the DNI determines a proposed      investment into the United States will have an operational      impact on the     Section 403.

TITLE VI--REPORTS AND OTHER MATTERS     Section 601. Declassification review of information on          Guantanamo detainees and mitigation measures taken to          monitor the individuals and prevent future attacks.       Section 601 requires the DNI to complete a declassification      review of intelligence reports prepared by the National      Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) on the past terrorist      activities of each Guantanamo detainee, for a detainee's      Periodic Review Board (PRB) sessions, transfer, or release      from To the extent a transfer or release preceded      the PRB's establishment, or the NCTC's preparation of      intelligence reports, Section 601 requires the DNI to conduct      a declassification review of intelligence reports containing      the same or similar information as the intelligence reports      prepared by the NCTC for PRB sessions, transfers, or      releases.       Section 601 further requires the President to make any      declassified intelligence reports publicly available,      including unclassified summaries of measures being taken by      the transferee countries to monitor the individual and      prevent future terrorist activities. Section 601 requires the      DNI to submit to the congressional intelligence committees a      report setting forth the results of the declassification      review, including a description of covered reports that were      not declassified. Section 601 also sets the schedule for such      reviews and further defines past terrorist activities to      include terrorist organization affiliations, terrorist      training, role in terrorist attacks, responsibility for the      death of United States citizens or members of the Armed      Forces, any admission thereof, and a description of the      intelligence supporting the past terrorist activities,      including corroboration, confidence level, and any dissent or      reassessment by the     Section 602. Cyber Center for Education and Innovation Home          of the National Cryptologic       Section 602 amends 10 U.S.449 to enable the      establishment of a Cyber Center for Education and Innovation-     Home of the National Cryptologic Museum (the ``Center'').      Section 602 also establishes in the Treasury a fund for the      benefit and operation of the     Section 603. Report on national security systems.       Section 603 requires the Director of the National Security      Agency, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and      Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to submit to the      appropriate congressional committees a report on national      security systems.     Section 604. Joint facilities certification.       Section 604 requires that before an element of the IC      purchases, leases, or constructs a new facility that is      20,000 square feet or larger, the head of that element must      first certify that all prospective joint facilities have been      considered, that it is unable to identify a joint facility      that meets its operational requirements, and it must list the      reasons for not participating in joint facilities in that      instance.     Section 605. Leadership and management of space activities.       Section 605 requires the DNI, in consultation with the      Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of      Staff, to issue an update to the strategy for a comprehensive      review of the United States national security overhead      satellite architecture required in the Intelligence      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.

The      congressional intelligence committees believe the current      fragmented arrangement across the IC does not provide      sufficient coherence to meet the threat, fosters duplication,      hinders integrated congressional oversight, and impedes      effective alignment with the Department of Defense space      activities. Section 605 also requires the DNI to submit a      workforce plan for space and counterspace operations, policy,      and acquisition. Section 605 further requires the Director of      the NRO and the Commander of U.Strategic Command to submit      a concept of operations and requirements documents for the      Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center, and to      conduct quarterly update briefings.     Section 606. Advances in life sciences and biotechnology.       The congressional intelligence committees recognize the      rapid advancements in the life sciences and biotechnology and      firmly believes that biology in the twenty-first century will      transform the world as physics did in the twentieth century.      The potential risks associated with these advancements are      less clear. The posture of the IC to follow and predict this      rapidly changing landscape is a matter of concern recognizing      the global diffusion and dual-use nature of life sciences and      biotechnology along with the dispersed responsibility of the      life sciences related issues across several National      Intelligence Officer portfolios.       Section 606 requires the DNI to brief the congressional      intelligence committees and the congressional defense      committees on a proposed plan and actions to monitor advances      in life sciences and biotechnology to be carried out by the      The Director's plan should include, first, a description      of the IC's approach to leverage the organic life science and      biotechnology expertise both within and outside the      Intelligence Community; second, an assessment of the current      life sciences and biotechnology portfolio, the risks of      genetic editing technologies, and the implications of these      advances on future biodefense requirements; and, third, an      analysis of organizational requirements and responsibilities      to include potentially creating new positions. Section 606      further requires the DNI to submit a written report and      provide a briefing to the congressional intelligence      committees and the congressional defense committees on the      role of the IC in the event of a biological attack, including      a technical capabilities assessment to address potential      unknown pathogens.     Section 607. Reports on declassification proposals.       Section 607 requires the DNI to provide the congressional      intelligence committees with a report and briefing on the      IC's progress in producing four feasibility studies      undertaken in the course of the IC's fundamental      classification guidance review, as required under Executive      Order 13526. Section 607 further requires the Director to      provide the congressional intelligence committees with a      briefing, interim report, and final report on the final      feasibility studies produced by elements of the IC and an      implementation plan for each initiative.     Section 608. Improvement in government classification and          declassification.       Section 608 assesses government classification and      declassification in a digital era by requiring the DNI to      review the system by[[Page S2754]]     which the Government classifies and declassifies national      security information to improve the protection of such      information, enable information sharing with allies and      partners, and support appropriate declassification. Section      608 requires the DNI to submit a report with its findings and      recommendations to the congressional intelligence committees.      Section 608 further requires the DNI to provide an annual      written notification to the congressional intelligence      committees on the creation, validation, or substantial      modification (to include termination) of existing and      proposed controlled access programs, and the compartments and      subcompartments within each. This certification shall include      the rationale for each controlled access program,      compartment, or subcompartment and how each controlled access      program is being protected.     Section 609. Report on implementation of research and          development recommendations.       Section 609 requires the DNI to conduct and provide to the      congressional intelligence committees a current assessment of      the IC's implementation of the recommendations issued in 2013      by the National Commission for the Review of the Research and      Development (R&D) Programs of the     Section 610. Report on Intelligence Community Research and          Development       Section 610 requires the DNI to develop and brief the      congressional intelligence committees on a plan, with      milestones and benchmarks, to implement a R&D Reserve Corps,      as recommended in 2013 by the bipartisan National Commission      for the Review of the R&D Programs of the IC, including any      funding and potential changes to existing authorities that      may be needed to allow for the Corps' implementation.     Section 611. Report on information relating to academic          programs, scholarships, fellowships, and internships          sponsored, administered, or used by the intelligence          community.       Section 611 requires the DNI to submit to congressional      intelligence committees a report on information that the IC      collects on certain academic programs, scholarships, and      internships sponsored, administered, or used by the     Section 612. Report on intelligence community employees          detailed to National Security Council       Section 612 requires the DNI to submit to the congressional      intelligence committees a classified written report listing,      by year, the number of employees of an element of the IC who      have been detailed to the National Security Council during      each of the previous ten years.     Section 613. Intelligence community reporting to Congress on          foreign fighter flows       Section 613 directs DNI to submit to the congressional      intelligence committees a report on foreign fighter flows to      and from terrorist safe havens abroad.     Section 614. Report on cybersecurity threats to seaports of          the United States and maritime shipping       Section 614 directs the Under Secretary of Homeland      Security for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) to submit to the      congressional intelligence committees a report on the      cybersecurity threats to seaports of the United States and      maritime shipping.     Section 615. Report on reprisals against contractors of the          intelligence community       Section 615 directs the IC IG to submit to the      congressional intelligence committees a report on known or      claimed reprisals made against employees of contractors of      elements of the IC during the preceding three-year period.      Section 615 further requires the report to include an      evaluation of the usefulness of establishing a prohibition on      reprisals as a means of encouraging IC contractors to make      protected disclosures, and any recommendations the IC IG      deems appropriate.

1234,topic-id,805,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 431 provides for full consideration, including making six amendments in order to H.23, the Gaining Responsibility on Water Act, and allows us to begin consideration of H.2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  H.23 is legislation necessary to deal with the severe water supply crisis facing California and other Western The region has experienced the worst drought in over 1,000 years, and many Western communities have been very negatively impacted.  This commonsense legislation fixes the broken regulatory system that is only exacerbating the impact of the drought conditions. The current regulatory system is overly complex and inconsistent. Making matters worse, various court decisions have only further complicated efforts to resolve these issues.  For example, this bill will help bring California's water infrastructure into the 21st century. The current water storage and delivery system is designed to serve approximately 22 million people, but the State currently has 37 million residents.  The bill is not only important to people in In fact, around half of our Nation's fruits and vegetables come from Every American could be hit in the pocketbook at the grocery store or checkout line if the California drought is allowed to continue.  Through this legislation, we can help expand water infrastructure and allow for greater water conveyance while ensuring environmental and water rights protections. Passing H.23 will directly help address the drought crisis and benefit families, farms, the environment, and the American economy.  The rule also allows us to begin consideration of the National Defense Authorization The bill provides for general debate and makes in order 88 amendments, including 41 minority amendments and 20 bipartisan amendments. Another rule is expected tomorrow to provide for consideration of additional amendments.  This open process actually started in the Armed Services Committee on which I serve. At the committee level, 275 amendments were offered, and 231 amendments were adopted during our committee markup last month.  I have said this many times on this floor, but it is worth saying again: there is no greater responsibility of the Federal Government than to provide for the safety and security of the American people. This year's NDAA does just that by reforming, repairing, and rebuilding the United States military.  The bill addresses the realities of the dangerous threat environment facing our Nation and ensures our troops and their families have the necessary resources and benefits.  Over the last decade, we have cut our military at an alarming rate. As the threats rack up, we have planes that can't fly, ships that can't sail, and soldiers who can't deploy. We must reverse this readiness crisis.  Thankfully, there is bipartisan support for boosting our Nation's military. In fact, this bill passed out of the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 60-1, continuing a strong bipartisan tradition of passing  I want to briefly highlight just a few of the positive provisions of this legislation.  The bill increases total military spending by 10 percent to rebuild the military from the current readiness crisis. This includes increasing the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army Guard and Reserve, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air  Given the serious threat posed by North Korea, the bill boosts missile defense programs, including adding an additional $2.5 billion above the President's budget request.  The bill also authorizes the construction of 13 new Navy ships, including three more littoral combat ships, as we work to grow toward a 355-ship fleet. It funds a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops and extends special pay and bonuses for servicemembers.  Importantly, the bill continues to advance Chairman Thornberry's priority of reforming and strengthening the military's acquisition process to make it more effective and efficient.  Given the evolving threats related to cyber, the bill improves the oversight of cyber operations.  The bill also helps set policy for the U.military relating to Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Russia, Africa, and the Asian Pacific region.  All told, this bill achieves important priorities of reforming, repairing, and rebuilding our military.  Each and every day, more than 2 million men and women put on the uniform of the United States and serve our country. As we have seen by two recent tragedies, the Marine plane crash in Mississippi and the USS Fitzgerald collision off the coast of Japan, these individuals put their lives on the line in order to protect the freedoms we all hold dear. They deserve the resources necessary to fulfill their mission and the benefits worthy of those who sacrifice so much.  So I am hopeful we can continue to move forward in a bipartisan manner to pass this NDAA, to support our troops, and to fulfill our constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense.

I would point out to the gentleman, and I think I did this in committee yesterday, that if this is passed, it will only be 16.8 percent of total Federal outlays, which means the single most important thing that we do here in government only gets less than 20 percent of the money that we are going to spend. So I don't think it is asking too much of ourselves, as the people responsible for providing for the defense of America, that we spend 16.8 percent of all the Federal money we are going to spend next year on making the American people safe and secure.  He spoke about tradeoffs. Let me tell you one tradeoff I don't think any of us should be willing to make, and that is trading off the safety and security of the American people for trying to keep some other overspending in some other part of the budget going.  We need to focus today, and in this bill, on what it takes to authorize the defense and the safety and security of the American people, and I believe this bill does that, as did all but one of my colleagues on the House Armed Services  So I believe that we have struck the appropriate balance here that does all that.

I strongly agree with my colleague from Vermont's remarks regarding the Budget Control It was passed for a good intention, but it has worked out quite differently from what people thought it was going to accomplish.  It is time for us to take responsibility, as the gentleman from Vermont said, and to do what we are supposed to do to make the priority decisions about what is important for America and what is not. Providing for the safety and security of the people of America, that is important. And if we have to make cuts in other parts of our budget to make sure we are doing that, first and foremost, I am happy to do it.  The gentleman is absolutely right about micromanagement. We have been micromanaging the people that we charge with defending America with how they are going to carry out combat responsibilities, particularly in the Middle President Trump, I think, quite rightly, has delegated many of those decisions down to Secretary Mattis so that our combatant commanders can make the decisions they have got to make as and when they need to make them.

I hope that at a future time the Foreign Affairs Committee, that has appropriate jurisdiction over that issue, will come forward with an AUMF that we can all discuss because we are now not just in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are in Syria, we are in Yemen, we are in Libya, we are in Somalia, where we have had some past history that is not so good.  We all--everybody, not just from the Armed Services Committee--need to understand these threats to our country and what we are going to do about them, have a strategy with a clear endgame, which we need and we haven't had for the last several years.  Then we should authorize it because only Congress has the power to declare war. We should authorize it. And by authorizing it, we not only take responsibility, but we communicate to our friends and our foes alike, and to those servicemen and -women who put themselves at risk out there that we are behind it. We, as the Representatives of the American people, are behind it. So I hope that we can do that, but it won't be in this particular bill.

That is 4 years from now. What the bill says is that if we find that Russia is in violation of the INF Treaty--and there is some indication that that is true--that we wouldn't extend it beyond 2021. But that is 4 years from now.  So what does that mean?  This is a shot across the bow to We are telling Russia: If you continue to violate the INF Treaty, we are not going to extend with you on  This is telling them: We are not going to let you get away with this.

Then there is Iran; Iran that, because of an ill-considered agreement reached with them by the Obama administration, now is on a path to get an ICBM of its own, which it doesn't need to strike It needs an ICBM to strike us.                              {time}  1330  Then they get as close as they want to under that agreement that we reached with them. Right up to the edge of violation, where they perfect their nuclear technology, they decide in a short period of time to violate it, put a nuclear weapon on one of those ICBMs and threaten us directly.  That and a host of other threats are what we are talking about in this bill. We have never faced such a complex set of threats since the end of World War It is not my word. It is the word of countless experts who have come before our committee.  We have to do this. The American people expect us to do this. Like many other people in this body, I do tele-townhalls.

They see what is happening in North They see what is happening in the Middle They know what Russia is up to. They are worried about China, and they want to know what we are doing.

Mr.Speaker, I appreciate everything that I have heard today from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle because I know people on both sides of the aisle care a great deal about these issues.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 431 and the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 431 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access      service shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the      Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The      first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points      of order against consideration of the bill are waived.      General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not      exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair      and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and      After general debate the bill shall be considered      for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order      against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion      of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the bill to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments      thereto to final passage without intervening motion except      one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day      the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.       7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.1868.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

1171,topic-id,853,"Mr.President, I come this morning to talk about the impending passage of a very failed healthcare bill in the House of Representatives and to remind my colleagues that this legislation moving through the House of Representatives is the first time in the 50-plus years of the Medicaid Program that they are going to pass legislation to cap and cost-shift Medicaid costs to  This is an $839 billion cost shift from the Federal government to States and a one-quarter cut to the Federal Medicaid investment over a period of ten[[Page S2746]]years. Some 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage. These draconian and arbitrary budget caps will leave States with impossible choices to cut people from care, cut provider reimbursements, or reduce benefits. Overall, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance. That is according to a recent Congressional Budget Office analysis.  Why do I say this is a broken promise? Because it was very clear that, when President Trump was a candidate, he said he was not going to cut Social Security, Medicare, or  Why is that important? Because these are trusted programs that have worked cost effectively for so many Americans in giving them access to care. Now is not the time, as we have seen a Medicaid expansion, to now cost-shift Medicaid to the States by breaking this promise and putting in it, for the first time in 50 years, a substantial change to the way Medicaid works. It does represent, in my opinion, a war on Medicaid--one that we cannot afford to wage.  Communities that have benefited from Medicaid expansion have seen the value of coverage and a healthy population. All you have to do is to talk to healthcare providers, hospitals, chambers of commerce, and others to get them to say that, yes, having more people with healthcare coverage in our community has helped us in raising the standard of living.  Why is that? First of all, uncompensated care is no longer put at the hospital's doorstep. Secondly, the population with healthcare coverage is healthier, getting treatment in advance as opposed to waiting for a crisis. It represents an investment in the community that allows a community to stabilize.  These are important issues for us to discuss. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will not fall for this ploy or that they will not go back on promises made by this administration not to cut  There are other aspects of the bill coming over from the House of Representatives, obviously, dealing with preexisting conditions, and we know from our own experience in the State of Washington that high-risk pools have covered only a tiny portion of people with preexisting conditions and are inadequate unless properly funded. As an article from the Seattle Times, from 2009, entitled ``Dozens of patients cut from state's high-risk insurance pool'' stated: ``with premiums that can top $20,000 a year, patients don't exactly clamor to join the state's high-risk health-insurance pool--a public insurer of last resort for patients with cancer, AIDS and other serious diseases . . . ,'' and ``the premiums cover only about 30 percent of the patients' medical and prescription expenses.''  There are many things that are working in the Affordable Care We have done great things on rebalancing; that is, to rebalance people from nursing home care to community-based care.  This chart shows how many States in the United States of America are doing this. This is in the Affordable Care We wrote a provision encouraging States to try to rebalance their population, not encouraging so much nursing home care because it is so expensive, and instead, trying to deliver the long-term care people need in their individual communities.  The great success of this is that many States in the Affordable Care Act took us up on it--States like Nevada, Iowa, Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and I saw in our own State, over a 15-year period of time, that we saved roughly $2.7 billion. That is $2.7 billion of cost. Instead of paying for a Medicaid population in expensive nursing home settings, we instead innovated and put them into what was a cost-effective delivery system in which people love to stay in their home as they age as opposed to the notion of expensive nursing home care.  I mention that because that $2.7 billion could be the kind of savings we would see in these So I tell my colleagues from the House: Innovate; don't capitate. Don't try to say that you have an ingenious idea on how to take care of healthcare costs by simply capitating, for the first time in 50-plus years, the Medicaid Program and then leaving the States to pick up the bill.  It won't work. Follow the ideas and strategies that are much better in helping us cut costs for an aging population that is living longer, and look for fixes that are already there in the Affordable Care Act to do so.

1173,topic-id,716,"Mr.President, I note, too, that we are going to be moving today, before we leave here, to what is the Omnibus resolution to keep the government open.  I wanted to mention an important aspect of the legislation we are going to be voting on. Pursuant to provisions in the Customs bill, we are now going to put funding into trade enforcement--a very important aspect of our trade agenda.  We know that more than 96 percent of the world's customers live outside the United By some estimates, at least 70 percent of the world's purchasing power is outside the United That means that we need to keep working hard to reach these new markets and these customers. The growing middle class has great purchasing power.  In 2015, the global middle class spent $33 trillion. By some estimates, the middle class could surpass 4 billion people by the year 2021, making it a majority of the world's population.  Approximately one in three jobs in the State of Washington are tied to international trade. Washington State exported approximately $80 billion in goods in 2016--from airplanes and coffee to apples and software. I know this about our State: we understand that we are in a global economy and that we have great products to sell in international markets.  Agriculture exports are very important to our Agriculture adds about $51 billion a year to our State's GDP, and the agricultural sector makes up more than 13 percent of our State's economy. In 2016, Washington exported $15 billion worth of food and agriculture products with $7 billion being of Washington origin. We are 1 in the nation in production of apples, hops, spearmint oil, wrinkled seed peas, concord grapes, sweet cherries, pears, green peas, raspberries for processing, blueberries and aquaculture. We are 2 in production of potatoes, certain kinds of grapes, nectarines, apricots, prunes, plums, sweet corn for processing, and a variety of other things.  This is to say that in the State of Washington, we grow a lot for overseas markets. Why am I talking about this important aspect of this bill that is passing to keep our government open today? Because in our State and across our country, we need to encourage more small businesses to export. And we need to make sure we have enforcement of a level playing field so that U.companies of all sizes and U.workers are protected as they compete in that global economy.  That is why, in the previously passed Customs bill, I created a Trade Enforcement Trust Fund at the Office of U.Trade Now, with this legislation passing today, we are putting $15 million toward that trust fund to be spent exclusively on enforcing trade agreements. We need to enforce the agreements and make sure Washington and businesses around the country get a fair deal as we work on trade. And $15 million in the fund would help us fight trade issues we have seen all over the globe.  For example, sometimes people try to sell their products by taking the great labels we have on Washington apples and putting them on foreign apples making them seem like Washington apples, when in reality they are not.

1155,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate Jewish American Heritage As a proud Jewish American, I am honored to have the opportunity to acknowledge our heritage and the ways by which it has helped shape this country. The list is a long one, but this year, I want to focus on Mendes Cohen, whose legacy serves as a microcosm of our community.  Mendes Cohen was born in Richmond, VA, in May of 1796 to Israel and Judith Solomon Cohen, both of whom were immigrants. Mendes's father came from Germany, and his mother came from His father died when Mendes was just 12 years old. The event was a tragedy, of course, for Mendes, his six siblings, and his mother, who moved the family to Baltimore for a fresh start shortly thereafter.  Mendes grew up not far from where I grew up; he was raised not unlike I was raised. He believed in the value of public service. He believed in serving his country and working for the good of his community. He held fast to an ideology based on tolerance, equality, and fraternity. It was precisely this ideology that led him to fighting in the War of 1812 at After the war, he and his brother Jacob began lobbying to change Maryland's constitution so that Jews could run for public office. In 1826, he was successful, and by 1847, he was a delegate in the Maryland General He carried his love of country and belief in public service with him throughout the remainder of his life, going on to serve as a delegate to the State Peace Convention during the Civil  Mendes was, simply put, a historic marvel. He was a forward thinker, an activist, a consummate public servant, and a proud He broke down the single greatest barrier to Jewish entry into public life and opened the door for Jews--including me--to pursue public service. Today, as I stand in this Chamber as a U.Senator from Maryland, I am struck by the impact of Mendes Cohen's legacy. If I were able to speak to him now, I would tell him: thank you. Thank you for paving the way for me to have it all: my faith, my family, my heritage, and my career in public service. If Mendes were able to speak now, I imagine he would tell us that his work is unfinished. He would encourage us to continue carrying the torch of public engagement and civil service. He would remind us that path toward progress, by its very definition, has no endpoint.  These values underpin the broader Jewish community in Maryland and across the country. We learned early in our own history that the tide of oppression and bigotry can rise quickly and that, when it floods one shore, it floods them all. We learned that, when it comes for one community, it spares none. We learned that we must be our own stewards--that pluralism and equality demand constant guardians and that, when prejudice threatens them, nothing but our own tenacity can fend it off.  That tenacity is needed now more than ever, as we are confronted by resurgent anti-Semitism in every corner of the world--even here, at home. In the past few months, we have witnessed hate speech targeted at the Jewish community on social media, the ostracism and vilification of Jewish students on college campuses, and attacks against Jewish businesses and synagogues; yet it is precisely because the Jewish community has endured generations of persecution that promoting tolerance, equality, and inclusion has become a central tenant of Jewish American culture.  Jewish Americans participated in the abolitionist movement in the 19th century. They joined the ranks of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the Civil Rights movement. The partnership between Julius Rosenwald and Booker Washington resulted in the construction of thousands of schools for African-American children in the South throughout the 20th  Jewish Americans are proud of their history promoting such causes. They are proud of their faith and their heritage, but they are also proud to profess their support of other people's faiths and heritage. They are proud to be guardians of a free and pluralistic society; they are proud to weave love out of millennia of knowing hate. That is the story of Jewish From Mendes Cohen to the American Jewish community's defense of diversity and inclusion today, every chapter we write, though unique, shares the same theme: progress--progress and equality.  Jewish Americans have, therefore, helped make the United States the force for human and equal rights that it is today, but each day, we face challenges to those ideals, challenges that[[Page S3206]]have felt increasingly ominous in recent months; yet this country will remain a beacon for the oppressed and the downtrodden. That beacon will stay lit due, in no small part, to the continued activism and conviction of the Jewish American community. This month, we thank them for that service, as we remind ourselves that our work goes on.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3205.txt,,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,25.0,May
1242,topic-id,908,"Mr.Speaker, I thank very much my colleague from both the Rules Committee and the Armed Services Committee, Mr.Byrne, for his work on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support both of these underlying bills, and I want to speak particularly about the National Defense Authorization  We are, today, living in a world where we face a more complex array of threats than at any time in the last 70 years. The obligation that we have to our men and women in uniform, to make sure that we provide them with the resources that they need to defend this Nation, is a more solemn obligation than any other we have.  There are many things that we were elected to do when we came to Washington, and we have done many of those things in this We have been a historically productive Congress in the months that we have been here. We have passed repeal and replace of healthcare reform, we have passed the repeal bill for Dodd-Frank, we have begun our important work on immigration reform, and we have done tremendous work on regulatory reform to lift the burden of the massive overreach of the Obama years. But there is nothing that we do that is more important than providing the resources for our men and women in uniform. This bill is a very important first step in that direction.[[Page H5450]]  I want to mention a couple of things that this bill does in particular.  In the aftermath of the ICBM test, the first successful North Korean ICBM test, one of the most important challenges we face as a nation is ensuring that we have provided for the defense of this Nation with respect to missile defense. This bill adds $2.5 billion above the administration's request for missile defense. It focuses on including additional interceptors for existing systems, as well as research for new technologies.  Total missile defense is still below the funding levels during the Bush administration. This bill is a very important first step, but, Mr.Speaker, we have got to do much more.  We also, in this bill, begin the process of providing the necessary additional resources and top line to begin to rebuild. We have not had a defense budget, Mr.Speaker, since 2011 that was based upon the Pentagon being able to assess the threats and telling us what we need to do to be able to defend against those threats.  We have now, because we are living under the Budget Control Act, had a Defense Department, instead, that has been obligated to fund at levels that are arbitrary and to cut at levels that are arbitrary. No nation can responsibly live under that system.  The next thing we have got to do is repeal the Budget Control We have got to recognize that we have a huge and growing debt crisis, a huge fiscal crisis, but that crisis is not being driven by our defense budget. The Budget Control Act has been ineffective at getting at what we need to do in terms of reducing the debt. Instead, it has gutted our defense.  We are in a world today where the North Koreans, the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese, ISIS, and al-Qaida are all continuing to make strides against us, Mr. One of the things that I am often asked as a new Member of this body is what has surprised me most in my time in I came to this body, Mr.Speaker, as somebody who has spent a lot of time focused on national security and defense issues, as someone who spent a large part of her career really invested in and studying and learning these issues, and I thought, Mr.Speaker, that I was relatively well informed about these issues.  I have been stunned, Mr.Speaker, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, briefing after briefing after briefing, at the extent to which we have fallen so far behind. And I think it is critically important for my colleagues, Mr.Speaker, and for the American people to understand the extent to which our adversaries are, today, fielding and developing capabilities and systems against which we cannot, may not be able to defend.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to read something that Ronald Reagan said back in 1982 on an issue when they were having similar issues and debates and discussions about defense spending. He said: ``Now, I realize that many well-meaning people deplore the expenditure of huge sums of money for military purposes at a time of economic hardship. Similar voices were heard in the 1930s, when economic conditions were far worse than anything we're experiencing today. But the result of heeding those voices then was a disastrous military imbalance that tempted the forces of tyranny and evil and plunged the world into a ruinous war. . . . We must never repeat that experience.''  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to remember that weakness is provocative, that it is when we are strong that we are most able to protect ourselves and to defend ourselves, and we must learn the lessons of the past. Passing this rule and passing the underlying legislation, this National Defense Authorization Act, is the first step in that direction.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative and to ensure that we do everything we can to defend our Nation and to make sure that we defend freedom for the next generation.

Additional funding is provided for fencing and other physical infrastructure, communications and surveillance technology, the hiring of additional agents, and additional detention beds to help stop the practice of catch and release. These funds will help reduce human trafficking and the flow of illegal drugs into our country.  While the additional funds for defense and border security have received much of the attention, there are many other important programs that are funded within the bill.  For the second year in a row, providing funding for research at the National Institutes of Health is increased by $2 billion. New funding is included to combat the opioid epidemic that has plagued communities across the country. The FBI receives additional funding to protect against terrorist threats and combat illegal cyber activity.  Throughout the bill, spending controls are placed on Federal agencies. There are more than 150 rescissions, consolidations, or program terminations within the bill. These savings have been reallocated to higher priorities.  The basis of this legislation is with regard to the 12 appropriations bills that were reported from the Appropriations This is the second year in a row that the committee has reported all 12 bills.

1161,topic-id,1220,"Mr.President, if I may speak on the bill before the Senate, yesterday the House of Representatives passed the Omnibus appropriations bill. Of course, this is the legislation that keeps the Congress and the government up and running through the end of the fiscal year, the end of It actually represents the first demonstration of Republicans and Democrats in both Houses of Congress working with the White House in order to pass an important piece of legislation and keep the government up and running through the end of the fiscal year.  Over the last few weeks, we have had many productive conversations and debates about how best to establish our priorities, how much we should spend--particularly my concern about underfunding our military and our national security funding but also to update our priorities because that is one of the things that happens in an appropriations bill. When programs are obsolete or ineffective, there is no way to eliminate them while operating under a continuing resolution. It takes a positive piece of legislation like an appropriations bill--like this appropriations bill--to eliminate those obsolete or no longer effective programs.  I am hopeful that once we pass this bill and after the President signs it, we will continue to plot a course toward a long-term strategic budget that reflects the priorities of the American people. I firmly believe we were elected to govern, not to shut down the government. In my view, that is an abdication of our responsibilities. I hope we will continue to follow on now after we have been able to accomplish this bipartisan, bicameral negotiation with the White House, and we will continue to govern and to demonstrate our sense of responsibility to the American people for doing just that.  This omnibus package includes a good blueprint for how we can order our priorities and take care of our country.  Yesterday I mentioned the increases in resources to better shore up border security. This is the largest increase in border security funding in 10 years. That is a significant accomplishment. This funding will help the Department of Homeland Security hire more Border Patrol agents and Customs officials to improve the infrastructure at our ports of entry and checkpoints and hire more immigration judges to process more immigration cases.  It also creates funding for our troops fighting abroad and for our military in general and includes a pay raise for our men and women in the military, which is very important as well, particularly in an All-Volunteer military and one that has been stressed by 15 years of continuous conflict around the world.  This bill also takes a more strategic look at the threats we are facing, including resources to shore up technology and equipment that will help our military stay 1. After years of putting military improvements and readiness on the back burner, actually cutting defense spending by 20 percent during the two terms of President Obama, this bill is a solid first step toward regaining our readiness and maintaining a capable and modern military.  While I never will doubt the American people responding or our military responding to the needs or the threats to our security, we don't want to be roused out of our complacency by a crisis occurring somewhere in the world, whether it is North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, Crimea, or elsewhere. We want to be ready on day one. Some of that readiness has seriously been called into question by some of our lack of prioritizing defense spending and military readiness generally.  In addition to those two important topics, many across the country have been impacted by severe weather, including violent storms and tornadoes. Of course, Texas has been a part of that sad story. Several in Texas have lost their lives due to these storms and the flooding caused by them. Of course we mourn for those who have lost loved ones and those who have been injured, but we have to do more than just grieve for them--we have to help them as well. This omnibus bill includes funding for previously approved disaster relief, which will help communities in Texas and throughout the country rebuild and recover following a natural disaster.  This legislation also includes money to help reduce the rape kit backlog. This is a topic which most people are not all that familiar with, but years ago we passed something called the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction Act, named for a heroic woman, Debbie Smith, who championed the use of forensic evidence and the tracing of DNA samples in order to solve sexual assault cases.  The amazing thing about this great technology and DNA testing is that it is enormously powerful. Even as long as 20 years later, we have had rape kits taken out of evidence lockers at law enforcement agencies and tested and come up with a hit on the FBI's database, which is the purpose of the testing. It also has the power to exonerate people who are perhaps falsely accused by excluding them scientifically from the possibility of being the assailant in a given case.  It is very important for us to fund important programs like the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction I know at one point there was an estimate that there were 400,000 untested rape kits in The problem was that we didn't really know how many there were because some of them were sitting, as I indicated earlier, in police evidence lockers, and others were sitting in the laboratory and not tested.  The question arose, when the identity of the assailant was known, what purpose could be served by testing the rape kit, which is not inexpensive? What we found is that the assailant, even if identified in the present case, is very likely to have been engaged in a course of conduct or serial assaults, and it helps us solve not only the present case but also other cases as well. Some of them are very old. That is important so that criminals can be brought to justice.  This bill also funds the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, It funds a Federal study for a Gulf Coast protection project and active-shooter training for first responders--all priorities important to my home State of  This legislation also represents changes in Washington since It is the first major piece of bipartisan legislation negotiated with the new Trump administration. Instead of pushing more regulations and rules that cripple our economy and disregarding the needs of our military and the stark realities of the border, this legislation begins to steer our country in a better direction.  I know that no piece of legislation is perfect, and perhaps the best definition of a negotiation is that both sides are dissatisfied because nobody gets everything they want. I look forward to voting for this legislation because I believe we were elected last November 8 to govern, not to abdicate those responsibilities or somehow engage in a shutdown narrative, which I don't think serves anyone well, certainly not the American people. I look forward to voting on this legislation and encourage all of our colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1183,topic-id,1055,"Mr.President, I am going to be voting no on this 1,700-page bill.  I am not blind to some of the good parts of the bill. It includes last year's Intelligence Authorization Act, and it includes some parts of the bill that I worked on that would counteract Russian activities in the United States and Europe--provisions that were blocked by the Obama administration since they refused to ever get tough on  It increases defense spending, although not to an adequate degree in relation to the threats we face.  For the first time in years, it recognizes that every dollar we spend on defense doesn't have to be matched by another dollar elsewhere in our budget.  Now, there are parts of this bill that got dropped that I would like to have seen, for instance, blocking Federal funding for sanctuary cities. We might as well call them ``outlaw cities'' because they refuse to comply with Federal immigration law and turn over illegal immigrants facing deportation to Federal authorities.  But I want to hone in on one particular provision that shows just how bad this process is. In a 1,700-page bill, they don't hide the good things in the bill. They only hide the bad things. So look to page 735, section 543, where you will find an increase in H-2B visas of almost 79,000--a 120-percent increase over the normal annual cap of a so-called seasonal visa program for temporary workers that can take up to 9 or 10 months.  It is not necessary. It has nothing to do with funding the government--nothing. It hasn't been vetted. It hasn't gone through the normal legislative process, which would be the Judiciary Committee, where the chairman and the senior Democrat both have written that they oppose this measure. I don't even know how it got in there. I don't know if it was the chairman or the ranking member. They may not know. It is 1,700 pages, after all. It takes hours to even figure out what it means because it is so complicated in language.  But this is what it does: It takes jobs away from American workers and abuses the immigrants that come into this country.  In the past 10 years, the Department of Labor has found 800 employers--800--that have abused 23,000 guest workers--everything from stealing their wages, demanding bribes for their visas, and even sexual abuse--and those are only the ones that have been caught. That is because unlike American workers, these immigrant workers cannot leave their job. If they are fired, they go back to their home country, where they often have huge families who are depending on them for their remittances. Their employers know that, and they take advantage of them. It is a newfangled form of indentured servitude.  Some people in this institution complain about the way Arab countries treat guest workers from South Asia and Southeast The conditions under which some of these H-2B workers operate are hardly much better. They live in filth and squalor. They are charged exorbitant fees for their housing and for their food. The employers largely get away with it because they know that these immigrant workers will not complain. They will not go to the authorities. They will not report it to the Department of Labor because if they do, they go back to their home country.  Those are just the immigrant workers. What about the American workers? There are a lot of reasons why unscrupulous American employers favor temporary guest workers. They don't have to pay payroll taxes on them, for instance. They don't have to pay unemployment taxes on them. But the real reason is that those guest workers have virtually no leverage to demand higher wages. As I said, they can be sent home because they are tied to a single employer. Americans have more bargaining power. If they can get a better wage down the road, then they will go down the road. If they get better benefits, they can go to a new job, but those guest workers cannot.  So the employers who abuse the H-2B program go to the greatest lengths to avoid hiring an American worker. The program says you have to advertise for the jobs in advance, and they do, hundreds of miles away in obscure newspapers that have nothing to do with the employer's local economy.  Many employers discourage Americans from applying in the first place. Remember, these are unskilled labor positions--unskilled. These are not high-tech jobs, but unskilled guest workers. They subject American workers to the most extreme, unreasonable, extraneous tests before they hire them--tests they do not give to those foreign guest workers because they can pay them lower wages. When they finally are forced to hire an American worker, because they face penalties from the Department of Labor if they don't, they try to make conditions as bad as possible for them so they can fire them and then replace them with a foreigner.  A lot of arguments for this kind of program boil down to this: No American will do that job. That is a lie. It is a lie. There is no job that Americans will not do. There is no industry in America where a majority of workers are not native born, American citizens, or first generation lawful immigrants--not landscapers, not construction workers, not ski instructors, not lifeguards, not resort workers--not a single one. If the wage is decent and the employer obeys the law, Americans will do the job. If it is not, then, they should pay higher wages. To say anything else is an insult to the work ethic of the American people who make this country run.  We just had an election in which the President distinguished himself more on immigration than on any other single issue. We all realize that, right? We all realize that uncontrolled mass migration is upending the politics and societies all across My colleagues realize that, right? What is it going to take for the people in Washington, DC, to realize just how out of touch they are when it comes to protecting the jobs and the wages of American workers?  I will vote no, and I will say that today is not the day when Washington realizes just how out of touch they are.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Mr.President, the Senate will soon vote on the government funding bill the House passed yesterday, and with it, critical resources to address a number of issues facing our country.  As I have noted over the course of this week, the bill includes a number of provisions that are important to our country, and today I would like to take a closer look at the positive impact they can make in the lives of the men and women we represent.  Our country is suffering from a terrible epidemic. Heroin and prescription opioid abuse is destroying families and communities all across our On average, overdoses from these drugs claim 91 lives every day--91 lives every day. Drug addiction can even devastate the lives of babies before they are born.  States like mine have been hit particularly hard by this epidemic. I have heard countless stories from Kentuckians who have experienced the heartbreak of addiction firsthand.  Here is one story that a grandmother from Independence, KY, shared with my office: ``[M]y granddaughter is growing up without a father due to this evil drug,'' she wrote. ``Our children are the future of this country and deserve all the help and support we can give them.''  Unfortunately, her story is similar to thousands more all across the land. Grandparents and other family members are increasingly taking care of children when parents fall into addiction. As too many families have experienced, addiction can have long-lasting and damaging effects on children and can be financially challenging for the caregivers.  A mom in Florence, KY, contacted my office about her son who is battling[[Page S2741]]addiction and frequently runs into trouble with the law. ``There are so many lives lost and so many more headed in that direction,'' she said. ``It's an epidemic, not a crime spree.''  We took decisive action against heroin and opioid abuse last year with the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures This bill before us, when we pass it, will provide significant new resources to combat this crisis as well.  These critical funds will go to prevention, treatment, and enforcement programs that can help our communities heal from this scourge and help keep more families from ever knowing the suffering associated with this epidemic.  Look, there is still more work to do to get the opioid crisis under control, but this funding legislation will take another critical step in the right direction. That is why substance abuse treatment organizations support it, including one local group that recently contacted my office in support of the bill. This legislation, in their words, will help ``[enhance] the ability of front lines providers to more effectively deploy resources and tackle this epidemic within our communities.''  That is making a positive and meaningful impact in the lives of the men and women we represent.  Healthcare benefits for thousands of retired coal miners were set to expire across the country at the end of this week. Men and women who dedicated their lives to providing an affordable and reliable source of energy to this Nation would have lost their healthcare, many of them when they needed it most.  I have met with retired coal miners numerous times in my office about this issue, including one retiree from Georgetown, KY, who worked as an underground miner for 10 years. He suffers from diabetes and heart disease, and his wife is a breast cancer survivor. ``There is no question whether or not we need our health insurance to continue,'' he said. ``Without it, we would probably lose our home, [which] would be catastrophic not to mention what might happen to our health because we could not afford to get coverage or our medicine.''  These coal miner retirees clearly needed our help, which is why I have been fighting for their healthcare at every step of the way. Today I am proud that this funding legislation includes my proposal to permanently extend healthcare benefits for thousands of retirees across the Nation and in These coal miners and their families can live with the peace of mind they have been looking for. That is making a positive and meaningful impact in the lives of the men and women we represent.  For too long, Federal bureaucrats in Washington imposed one-size-fits-all education policies on our children. Distant bureaucrats dictated nationwide policies, even though the needs of a student in Kentucky are different from of a student in Maine or For this reason, we enacted the Every Student Succeeds Act education reform law last Congress, which sends power back to the States, parents, and teachers, and this funding bill will support its implementation, giving our schools the resources they need to prepare our students.  This funding legislation also supports school choice through reauthorization of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and through increased Federal funding for charter schools. Both of these school choice provisions will help expand opportunities for parents to send their children to the school that best meets their needs.  In my home State of Kentucky, the increased support for charter schools will be very important, as the new Republican majority in Frankfort recently passed a charter schools law.  Yesterday I met with State Representative Carney and charter school advocates who were key to shepherding this legislation into law down in I thank them for their efforts on behalf of Kentucky's students and families, and I look forward to working with them to support charter schools in Kentucky going forward.  By funding the implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act and supporting school choice across the country, this legislation will help parents and students achieve strong educational outcomes. That is making a positive and meaningful impact in the lives of the men and women we represent.  Of course, this bill contains other important wins for the country as well. It includes the largest border security funding increase in a decade, allowing our country to better support border security agents, enhance technology, and update critical infrastructure down at the border. It includes important resources to help us begin rebuilding our military, allowing our country to give servicemembers more of the tools that they need, and fund a much needed raise for our men and women in uniform.  On military funding, we broke out of the years-long insistence by our colleagues on the other side that every increase in defense had to be met by an increase on the domestic side. That is no longer the law.  As I have outlined several times this week, this legislation includes other conservative priorities as well. Importantly, it achieves these things while conforming to spending caps and reducing bureaucracy, even consolidating, eliminating, or rescinding funds for over 150 government programs and initiatives.  Because of hard work from both Chambers and both sides of the aisle, we have a funding bill before us that can make many important and positive impacts in the lives of the people we represent. I know I will be supporting it, and I urge colleagues to do the same.  I look forward to its passage so we can send the agreement to President Trump for his signature.

1103,topic-id,4262,"Mr.President, let me thank my colleague from New Jersey for his excellent remarks on the Affordable Care Act and its future and really spotlight the point he made. He and I have been around legislatures for a long time, both at the local level, State level, and here in If you have something you are really proud of--a bill--you can't wait to roll it out. We have a place for a press conference about every 15 feet in the corridors around here. We have a press corps that fills the Gallery when they all show up, and they are anxious to hear our story. If you have something you are proud of--and each of has had that legislation--you put it in a press release and do the social media and the whole number.  If you are unfortunate to be in the position to bring a bill to the floor you are not very proud of--you don't know how you can explain it back home--you keep it secret. You do it behind closed doors.  What the Senator has said is exactly the truth--and we know it, as our colleagues on the other side know it. They have, for the past several weeks, since the House passed their bill, been meeting behind closed doors. So 13 male Senators--why they couldn't invite the women Republicans in the Senate--it is their decision--I can't understand. They have not produced one thing for public consumption--nothing. Yet, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, tells us: Well, you have 10 days. We are going to pass the new healthcare system for the United States of America in 10 days, and pretty soon we are going to show you what we are going to propose.  It tells you the whole story. There is something in there that is painful, that hurts them politically, and that they can't really explain. After all these years--``Repeal ObamaCare, repeal ObamaCare,'' they can't come up with an alternative they can sell to the American people.  I thank the Senator for pointing out his experience, and the experience he is finding in New I am finding the same thing back in  I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his statement.  This last Saturday, I was invited to debate a Republican House Member from my hometown of Springfield, IL, on his vote in favor of TrumpCare--if you want to call it that--the Republican healthcare plan in the We were invited by the Ministerial Alliance of Springfield, the African-American ministers. I accepted the invitation on a Saturday afternoon, and he did as well.  He put conditions on it. 1, no media coverage. This is not open to the public. Really? We are going to debate a healthcare system change for America that is going to affect millions of people, and we will not talk about it in public? But that was his ground rule. And then in the midst of it, he thought someone was taping him while it was going on and stopped full sentence and said: I don't want this taped. Well, here is a bill he voted for to change the healthcare system for the people he represents, including the folks in that room, and he didn't want to be on the record or public about that discussion. That tells me a lot as well.  It isn't just a secret bill we haven't seen, it is a lot of Republican House Members who voted for it--and they were all Republicans--passed by, I believe, two or three votes, and now they don't want to talk about it. Well, there is a message there.  Here is what I have concluded after looking at this in a lot of different ways. Where you stand on healthcare in America depends on where you start on the question: Do you believe every American has a right to affordable, quality healthcare? If the answer is, no, that is for people who are lucky or rich or have the right job, then you can reach the same conclusion they did in the House when they passed the Republican measure because, you see, their bill removed health insurance coverage from 23 million Americans, instead of expanding the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage, which we set out to do with the Affordable Care The Republicans have reversed field. They are taking away health insurance from more people than the Affordable Care Act gave.  Is that a press release from the Democratic National Committee I just quoted? It was the Congressional Budget Office--a bipartisan group here, an agency in Washington that analyzes our legislation and gives us their analysis. They looked at the Republican bill and said it will cost 23 million people in America their health insurance.  If you started with the position that healthcare is a right, you would stop at that point and say: Well, this bill clearly doesn't work because it takes away healthcare coverage instead of creating healthcare coverage.  Where you start is where you stand.  The second question is this: If you believe the highest priority of this effort is to cut taxes on wealthy people, then, of course, you would vote for what they passed in the House--$700 billion in tax cuts. Now, that tax cut came right out of the healthcare system of That is the tax revenue that is used to expand Medicaid insurance coverage to those who are lower income workers. That is the money that is used to help subsidize the premium payments of middle-income workers who can't afford the monthly premium.  But they believed--the Republicans who voted in the House--that there is a higher priority than helping those people to have health insurance, and that is cutting the tax burden of the wealthiest people in So if you start with that premise--that you have to cut taxes by $700 billion regardless of what happens--this is what you end up with, the measure that came over from the House of I don't know what the Senate Republicans will come up with in response to that, but clearly it must be parallel or close to what the House of Representatives did.  Let's take a close look at this measure and take a look at the history that brought us to this moment. As I mentioned, we still don't have the text of the Republican secret bill to repeal the Affordable Care Six years and counting, they can't produce a replacement. It looks like we are going to vote on this in a few days. By congressional standards, this is a high crime and misdemeanor. To think that we are going to consider a bill within 10 days affecting every American, affecting one-sixth of the American economy--a bill that will say to some people: You are going to lose your health insurance, and to others: We are going to offer you a health insurance policy that really isn't worth the paper it is written on, and we haven't seen the bill.  Well, what is the history of this? Is this the way the Republicans always operate? Not really. In December 2009, Republican Senator McConnell, their leader, said, when we were debating the Affordable Care Act: ``This massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors without input from anyone in an effort to jam it past, not only the Senate, but the American people.'' That was Senator McConnell about the Affordable Care Act when it was being proposed by President  Well, what is the fact? During the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Senate held over 50 bipartisan hearings on the bill. How many bipartisan hearings have we held on the new Republican healthcare proposal? None, not one.  At that time, 6 years ago, we had a week-long markup in the Finance Committee and a month-long markup in the HELP The Senate spent--and I remember this well--25 consecutive days in session on the floor of the Senate debating this bill. It is the second longest consecutive period of time ever spent on a bill in the  We considered on the floor of the Senate hundreds of amendments. You know, we ended up adopting 150 Republican amendments to the Affordable Care Not a single one of them would vote for it, but we took their proposals to make it better seriously and adopted 150 changes.[[Page S3640]]  How much of a chance will we have to amend the Senate Republican bill that may come before us as soon as this week? It remains to be seen. It could be what we call a vote-arama around here, which is a corruption of what this grand institution really established as a standard of operation for generations and centuries. The vote-arama lets you vote on an amendment offered to the bill, with 2 minutes of debate.  You are changing the healthcare system and you have 1 minute on each side to debate your amendment? Is that a serious undertaking with something that is that consequential for so many Americans? No one has seen this secret bill--not Democrats, not many Republican  I asked Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price last week in a hearing: Have you seen the bill? You are the one that is going to have to implement it.  He said: No, I haven't seen it either .  This weekend the Presiding Officer, Senator Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said:       The Senate is not a place where you can just cook up      something behind closed doors and rush it for a vote on the      floor.  Mr.President, I couldn't agree more.  Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, said:       I want to make sure the American people, I want to make      sure the members of Congress have enough time to evaluate it.      I want to have enough time to really take a look at what      we're voting on.  That was Republican Senator Ron Johnson of  Senator Bob Corker, a Republican Senator from Tennessee, said:       I've said from Day 1 and I'll say it again: The process is      better if you do it in public. Obviously, that's not the      route that is being taken.  I didn't pull these quotes from months and years ago. They are from the weekend. The comments were made over the weekend by Republican Members about their very own leadership and the process they are following in preparing to change America's healthcare system.  Let's talk about some numbers. Let's start with zero. How many hearings have we had on the Senate bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act? How many markups have we had? How much time has the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the man responsible for implementing this bill, spent on it to review it? How much Democratic input has been allowed for this secret negotiation? How many women Senators have been involved in crafting the bill? How many medical organizations or patient groups support the secret Senate bill? And most concerning of all, how much time has the public had to even read this bill?  Let's take a look at another number: 23 million. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 23 million Americans will lose their health insurance under the House-passed repeal bill--1 million in  I have said it before, but I will say it again--and this is a driving factor in terms of my views on the subject: If you have ever in your life been the parent of a seriously ill child and didn't have health insurance, you will never forget it as long as you live. I know. I have been there.  I was a law student, newly married, with a brand new baby girl with a really serious health issue, and I had no health insurance. My wife and I sat in the charity section at Children's Hospital waiting for them to call our name so we could take our little girl in to the latest resident, with a hundred questions and who wanted to go through them all over again. I thought to myself: Durbin, how did you ever reach this point where you don't have health insurance?  I fixated on health insurance from that point forward. From the time I got out of law school, for years afterwards while my daughter was growing up, I not only had health insurance, but I sometimes had two health insurance policies. I was so worried about having coverage if I ever really needed it.  So we want to take health insurance away from 23 million Americans? Do you want it to be your family, your son, your daughter? I sure wouldn't.  Here is another number: 750. Lower income older Americans would see their premiums increase 750 percent under the House-passed repeal bill, from $1,700 under ACA to $14,000 under the Republican plan. Now, how can that happen? How can you see the premiums go up that fast? We built into the affordable care bill a guaranteed protection for disparity in premium payments of no more than three to one. The most expensive health insurance policy cannot be more than three times the lowest cost policy. The Republicans changed that to five to one. Well, who does that affect?  If you are between 50 and 64 years of age, you are in a category of people not yet eligible for If you are now facing chronic illnesses that could make health insurance more expensive, you will pay the higher premiums. The higher premiums, when calculated, are dramatically higher for this group. That is why the American Association of Retired Persons has come out foursquare against the Republican TrumpCare, the Republican repeal bill. It is just unfair to those between the ages of 50 and 64.  Some 130 million, that is how many people nationwide have preexisting conditions. Almost half of the people in Illinois have a preexisting condition. Several weeks ago, I had a procedure for an atrial flutter. It worked out just fine. Now I have a preexisting condition. I am in that category. What does that mean? If you went out to buy health insurance with a preexisting condition, you are charged more, if you could buy insurance at all.  So when the Republican bill that passed the House does not guarantee, as the Affordable Care Act, that you cannot be discriminated against because of a preexisting condition, it makes millions of Americans--130 million--more vulnerable.  Is that what they wanted to achieve?  Where you stand depends on where you start. If you think everyone is entitled to health insurance, then you can't be standing for something that allows preexisting conditions to be used against you. A lot of the people whom I am talking about have employer insurance, but what about those who shop on the individual market or purchase individual insurance in the future? Under the House repeal bill, insurers would, once again, be allowed to charge people with preexisting conditions more money for insurance.  The next number is 33,000. Senator Menendez referred to it. That is how many people are dying every year because of the opioid or heroin overdose--33,000, and 1,800 a year in  Now, listen to this. The Republican bill dramatically cuts the Medicaid Program, the Nation's largest provider of substance abuse treatment services, and it allows insurers, once again, to refuse coverage for those needed services.  I have been here a few years, and I can remember that desk because that is where Paul Wellstone of Minnesota sat, and I remember that desk because that is where Pete Domenici of New Mexico sat. You couldn't ask for two more polar opposites politically. Paul Wellstone was a garrulous, proud liberal. Pete Domenici was a proud conservative. One was from Minnesota, and one was from New Mexico, and they came together on an issue.  Do you know what the issue was? Each of them had someone they loved in their family who suffered from a mental illness, and they said: Why in the world will health insurance companies refuse to write coverage for people with mental illness? They fought for years against the insurance companies, and they finally won.  We included, in the Affordable Care Act, the requirement that your health insurance policy cover not only physical illness but mental illness. It was a breakthrough. For the first time, we stopped treating mental illness like a curse and treated it like an illness that could be treated.  They added a section at the end that most of us didn't even notice: mental illness and substance abuse treatment. I didn't know it was there until the opioid crisis, and I started going to these rehab facilities and saying to these people there: How are you paying for this care? Some of them were under Medicaid, but those under private health insurance said: My policy covers it. It covers it because Wellstone and Domenici insisted on putting it in.  After that historic victory, you would think the Republicans would include mental illness and substance[[Page S3641]]abuse treatment as one of the basic essential services for health insurance, but they don't.  When they say we are going to write a bill that gives Americans more choice in their health insurance--oh, that sounds appealing--the choice is whether you want mental illness and substance abuse treatment or you don't.  Well, from where I am sitting, that is the kind of insurance coverage that should be basic to everyone. You never know whether that little girl that you are raising--that beautiful little girl--6 years from now is going to be struggling with an addiction. At that point, you better hope that your health insurance policy has some coverage so that you can save her life and bring her back from that addiction.  Now, 280,000 is the next number. That is how many children in Illinois depend on Medicaid for school-based health and medical services, from feeding tubes and handicapped buses to special education teachers. I made a point this last week when I was home to visit the schools in Chicago and Bloomington and hear firsthand what cuts in Medicaid meant to local school districts.  Many Senators don't realize this, but the kids with whom you are dealing who have learning disabilities and other disabilities, many of them are supported at your local schools by Medicaid dollars. The Medicaid dollars pay for the counselors, pay for the special buses, and pay for the feeding tubes for these kids to survive. So when you make a dramatic cut in Medicaid, as the Republican bill that came out of the House does, you endanger the very services and the very benefits that these special ed kids need. The school districts are mandated by law to help these kids, but if the money is cut off from Medicaid, what are they going to do?  The Republican repeal bill that every Republican Congressman in my State voted for slashes $40 billion in Medicaid funding to Illinois, including money to school districts.  Three--this is the most important single number in the next 10 days in the Senate--3. That is the number of Republican Senators needed to stop this. Surely, there are three Republican Senators who are concerned enough about this secret, behind-closed-doors process that we are witnessing when it comes to rewriting healthcare in America--at least three Republican Senators who want to take time to properly review this legislation that affects one-sixth of our economy.  Just the Senators who have publicly stated their personal concerns about this process--if the three of them would come together, we could stop this and do it the right way.  I said privately to a Republican Senator last week, after the tragedy where a Republican Congressman was shot at a baseball practice: Isn't this the moment when we ought to get together quietly--Democrats and Republicans--when we ought to sit down and write a bill we can both be proud of? I am hoping he was listening.  I am hoping that three Republican Senators, if they stand up for it, will help us achieve that goal. Surely there are three Republican Senators who are worried about the kids in their States like I am worried about the kids in mine, who do not want to make the opioid epidemic any worse, who want to make certain--underline the word ``certain''--that they are protecting the people they represent from discrimination because of preexisting conditions. Surely there are at least three Republican Senators who do not want to throw millions of Americans off of health insurance coverage. Maybe some of the Senators who represent States that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic will step forward. There are a lot of them. It only takes three to change this.  To Republican Senators, I say: Do not do this. Do not do this secret process. Democrats are willing to work with you to improve our healthcare system. I have said before that the only perfect law that I know of was carried down a mountain on clay tablets by Senator All of the other efforts can use some work, and in this case, we are willing to work with you. Take repeal off the table, and we will put a chair up to the table.  Over the past week, I have received thousands of emails and letters from Illinoisans who are worried about what is happening in the Senate today.  Helen, from River Forest, IL, is 47 years old. She is a primary caregiver for her parents. Her mom has Alzheimer's and is in a nursing home.  Here is what Helen writes:       Just before Thanksgiving, my dad's health deteriorated. He      is now in hospice in the same nursing home. I have spent all      of their savings--my mom and dad's savings--on healthcare. My      mom is finally eligible for Without Medicaid, I      would need to bring my parents to my home and quit my job to      personally nurse them myself because I don't have the money      myself to keep them in the nursing home and pay for private      care. Please protect ObamaCare and  Here is Madeline from Chicago, who writes:       My younger sister is disabled. Before the Affordable Care      Act went into effect, she was just about to hit the maximum      lifetime limit on her private insurance policy.  That used to be the case. You would sign up for insurance, and you would say: Oh, great coverage--no copays, no extra charges. Then you would find in the fine print that there is a limit to the coverage of $100,000. My friends, I can tell you that we are--each and every one of us--one diagnosis or one accident away from having more than $100,000 in medical bills. It happens pretty quickly. That used to be built into insurance policies. We outlawed it under the Affordable Care Now, in the name of ``choice,'' the Republicans want to bring that back.  Madeline writes:       Before the ACA went into effect and my daughter was about      to hit the maximum lifetime limit on her private insurance      policy, she was going to have to apply to be part of a high-     risk pool, but that was going to involve a long wait, without      any insurance, plus high premiums if and when she was      accepted into the pool. The Affordable Care Act came just in      time for my sister and for our family.  When the Republicans in the House say not to worry about people with preexisting conditions, that they have set aside $8 billion to take care of them in private risk pools, it is sad and, in a way, tragic that they would say that. That is not nearly enough money, and there is no guarantee that private risk pools that never worked before the Affordable Care Act would work in the future. It is a way to give an answer to the obvious question of why they are dropping so many people with preexisting conditions from guaranteed coverage.  The last note is from Erin of Chicago, who writes:       I implore you to force a public hearing on the ACA repeal      that the Republicans are trying to sneak through. If this      bill passes, many of my friends and family will lose coverage      either due to preexisting conditions or because the      deductibles are too high. Additionally, my parents are self-     employed and getting older. Under the proposed act, their      health insurance premiums will likely increase to $14,000 a      year. They cannot afford it. They just can't. They will not      have coverage, will get sick, and be unable to afford care.  If the Republicans have a better idea than the Affordable Care Act, for goodness' sake, stop hiding it from the American people. Stop talking about it behind closed doors. If it is such a good idea, bring it out for the world to take a look at. There will be critics. There were certainly critics with regard to the Affordable Care I remember that very well. Yet that is what this body is all about.  The Senate is supposed to be a place where we deliberate on the important issues of our time. Is there anything more important than your health, the health of the people whom you love, and your opportunity to get basic healthcare so that you can protect them?  I implore the Republicans and those who know that this is the wrong way to go to stand up and say so. It only takes three Republican Senators to do this a much different way so as to bring credit to this institution and create a bill--create a change--that makes healthcare more affordable, more accessible, and more fair to more  I yield the floor.

1174,topic-id,555,"Mr.President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Senate is considering H.244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. This measure provides full-year appropriations for Federal Government agencies and contains spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current statute.  This measure includes $93,470 million in budget authority that is designated as being for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of Of that amount, $76,985 million is for spending in the security category, and $16,485 million is for nonsecurity spending. CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $41,444 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017.  Division F includes $6,713 million in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority that is designated as being for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of This designation makes the spending associated with this provision and its associated outlays of $336 million eligible for an adjustment.  This legislation includes language that increases nonsecurity discretionary budget authority by $1,444 million this year and designates it as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of CBO estimates this budget authority will result in $497 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017.  Finally, division H provides $1,960 in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for program integrity efforts. This funding is designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(C) and section 251(b)(2)(B) of CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,635 million in outlays this year.  As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by $76,985 million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $26,602 million, and increasing outlays by $43,912 million in fiscal year 2017.

If we vote to approve it, an amendment unanimously supported by the Armed Services Committee--unanimously, all Democrats and all Republicans would compromise language--to prevent President Trump from using our military's money to build his border wall will suddenly vanish. It is a legislative magic trick, a sneaky gimmick designed to disguise their actions.  Once again, Speaker Ryan and the House Republicans are doing President Trump's dirty work. They want to make sure that Trump can build his wall, but they are also desperate to avoid a clean up-or-down vote on this issue. They are hiding from the American voters.  They didn't have the courage to oppose my amendment in committee or even on the House floor. They passed this rule late at night with hardly anyone watching, in typical Republican fashion.  Republicans are resorting to deceptive legislative tactics to do Trump's bidding just for his small, fragile ego.  Mr.Speaker, this self-executing rule, if it comes to fruition, is going to attempt to slip one past Congress and the American people.

We must not allow precious resources to be robbed from our troops simply to score political points for Trump's ego.  Mr.Speaker, with Mexico refusing to entertain this absurd policy and without a direct appropriation from Congress, President Trump is going to get desperate. His administration will inevitably seek to pull money from other sources to make good on his promise to build this wall, including from the Defense budget.  That is why my amendment was so crucial. It would simply ensure that DOD resources aren't siphoned off for a pointless wall that we don't need and cannot afford. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, the ranking member and the chairman.  As a Member of Congress, we have a sacred responsibility to ensure that money meant to address real national security challenges isn't diverted to combat imaginary ones that the President has created.                              {time}  1300  As a Marine Corps veteran, I believe it would be an insult to our members of the military if their resources were reallocated to build a wall that we don't need, that won't bring us more security, when we have tens of thousands of military members that are currently still on food stamps while serving this country.

1064,topic-id,3793,"Mr.Speaker, I have to say that it is a privilege and it is good for the House and good for America when Judge Ted Poe is on the floor making a case. He was a great judge, a great prosecutor before that, and we will always need his voice making a case here on the floor, especially the kind of strong case he was just making. And I want to follow up with that.  There was a story yesterday, June 22, by Kristina It says:  ``James Comey may have misled Senators on May 3, when he testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had never been an anonymous source in news reports related to the Russia investigation.  ``By that time, he had already leaked several private conversations he had with President Trump to his friend Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the blog Lawfare and former editorial writer for The Washington Post.''  Mr.Speaker, I am sure you will recall, as we see every day, evidence that The Washington Post does not just despise Donald Trump, they are actually malicious in their reporting. President Trump, as a public figure, would normally have a tough time making a case as a public figure for libel or slander because you have to prove malice. The Washington Post has proved repeatedly they are not interested in fairness or anything resembling balance. They can't stand Donald Trump, and they are out to try to get him in a malicious fashion.  So when anybody, especially somebody with the FBI, leaks anything to people that may have it end up in The Washington Post, they, indeed, themselves become part of the malice for our  The article says:  ``Wittes wrote in a piece on May 18, only 9 days after Comey was fired, that the former FBI Director had shared those conversations `over the previous few months.' He wrote:  ``Comey never told me the details of the dinner meeting; I don't think I even knew that there had been a meeting over dinner until I learned it from the Times story. But he did tell me in general terms that early on, Trump had `asked for loyalty' and that Comey had promised him only honesty. He also told me that Trump was perceptibly uncomfortable with this answer.''  Now, let me insert here because obviously Mr.Comey does not understand what loyalty means and why a President of the United States would ask for loyalty from the Director of the But what loyalty means from a Director of the FBI is: Mr.President, I will be loyal to the administration. I will not go out and leak things to the media and I will not go out and stab you in the back every chance I have, even though I have these friends that hate your guts. And I know when I leak things or share things to people that can't stand the President, it is going to hurt him and it is going to be disloyal.  That is what loyalty is. It is outrageous for someone to try to make an obstruction case out of a President asking for loyalty.  Look at what the Obama administration did. They prosecuted more people that they alleged were leakers than all other administrations put together. They were aggressive in prosecuting disloyalty.  Donald Trump, on the other hand, as President of the United States, wasn't threatening to prosecute the way the Obama administration obviously had done. And he didn't try to make an example of everybody by having them prosecuted if they leaked anything. Otherwise, Comey would be standing before a judge answering charges right now; and maybe that should come later.  All he was asking for is: I need you to promise me loyalty.  And the very question of a President just asking for loyalty ended up being a source of evidence that Mueller--not That is another case altogether. There is plenty of evidence about him--that Comey is probably the most disloyal FBI Director since Edgar Hoover was taping Presidents himself and having them watched and spied on.  So it is amazing, as smart as James Comey is--I have questioned him a number of times, so I know how smart he is. But as smart as he is, he couldn't figure out that loyalty would mean you don't run--try to make your President look bad after a simple meeting where the President just asked: Would you be loyal? I am not asking for the I am not asking for anything outrageous. I am simply asking: Would you please be loyal?  And even as President Trump was, apparently, asking for loyalty, this disloyal, dishonest Director of the FBI was already turning wheels in his head: How can I hurt this President? I know a reporter that hates Trump, who worked for the Trump-hating Washington Even though he is not there now, he will know how to help me hurt Trump.[[Page H5135]]  I mean, even as the President is asking for loyalty, that is what he is getting in the mind of the FBI  So is it any mystery when we look back at the case history we have talked about here on the floor about how Comey manipulated John Ashcroft into recusing himself so Comey could push his own dear friend and godfather of his child, Patrick Fitzgerald, into being special counsel to go after the Bush administration?  Clearly, Comey and Fitzgerald were hoping to nail Karl Rove's and Dick Cheney's hide to the wall. That is what they were after.  And how do we know?  Because on day one--well, of course, the fact that Comey would push the godfather of his child into that position tells you all you need to know, but there is plenty more.  They both knew that Richard Armitage had leaked Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent. And they knew that there was no need for a special counsel or a special investigation. Yet they spent millions of dollars and man-hours trying to get beyond that and find some way to nail somebody they didn't like.  You would call that dishonesty or disloyalty because honesty would have had Comey and his dear friend and godfather of his child immediately going public on day one.  This would be honesty, to go forward and say: We know that the godfather of my child here, Patrick Fitzgerald, was appointed to find out who leaked information about Valerie Plame and her dishonest husband, Joseph Wilson, who lied to the CIA and lied to Congress, but we still need to know.  And guess what. We already know on day one who leaked it. It was Richard There is no need to squander taxpayer dollars and there is no need for the government to pay massive amounts of money to Patrick Fitzgerald to do this investigation.                              {time}  1230  We are honest individuals. We are coming forward, and, yeah, maybe it wasn't all that honest for me to put my dear close friend, Fitzgerald, in this position, but I am going to be honest now. We don't need this investigation.  But that is not what they did. They were disloyal and dishonest to the American people, to the Bush administration, and to justice. They asked for expanded jurisdiction, made it seem like they were on the trail of something big.  No, they weren't on the trail of anything big. They had nothing. They wanted to try to get somebody prosecuted, and that way they could try to justify the massive amount of expenditures for nothing, for no good reason, that they were about to go through.  Eventually, they prosecuted Scooter Libby for allegedly being inconsistent with something he said--same thing they went after Martha Stewart for.  There was no insider trading that Martha Stewart engaged in. And I know she is not a fan of Republicans--seems like a very nice person when I talked to her--but she was treated grossly unfairly. There was no insider trading. So they keep talking to her until they find they think she said something inconsistent so they could get a conviction, get a scalp under their belt, figuratively speaking, and claim they had done some great good. Comey was underneath, behind the scenes in that as well.  So it is amazing to me how anybody could try to be accusatory of someone, a President that said: Can you please promise me you will be loyal?  He didn't ask for anything illegal, nothing unethical, but apparently--you know, I didn't know Donald I supported Ted Cruz for over a year for But I have come to understand, this man has amazing instincts with people, amazing business acumen, figures out when something makes sense and something doesn't make sense.  One of the other Members of Congress just this morning was saying: You know, I never realized until I had seen the President in person, the man really has a big heart.  It was kind of surprising to some folks. But you get the inkling of it the more you are around him. And you see the way he treats kids, and we saw the way he treats children. You know, we saw the way he was so good to all kids. It didn't matter--he didn't care if they were Democrats' kids or Republicans' kids.  But I do recall, 8 years ago, one of my friends from Texas had a daughter, had her little book and pen, saw kids lined up getting an autograph from President So she ran over to get an autograph, and she came back in tears because she said when he got to her, he said, ``I am not signing yours,'' and walked away. Her parents assured her it was nothing personal. He just obviously had some kind of emergency.  But then later on, before the congressional picnic was over, she saw other children lined up getting an autograph. She ran, got to the end of the line, and once again, when President Obama got to her, he said, ``I told you, I am not signing yours.'' It took a long time to get over that.  But a lot of the people that saw the way President Obama treated some kids--not all of them, but some--saw the way President Trump didn't care anything about their background, what party their parents supported. He was just a gracious guy, obviously showed a big heart for kids.  So it would be understandable that somebody in business, doing multimillion-dollar deals, would need to know people were going to be loyal. And I have come to know enough about Donald Trump and his intuition about people he is dealing with, if he asks someone to be loyal and that person hedges their bets, said, well, I will be honest--I haven't asked him, but I am willing to bet when James Comey refused to say he would be loyal but said he would be honest, I would be willing to bet you Donald Trump knew immediately this man is not going to be loyal or honest, and that is exactly what has happened.  James Comey has been both disloyal to his country, to the FBI, and to the President he was serving. He admitted leaking information. And some of us believe that if President Trump had not tweeted out, making reference to potential tapes of their conversations, that the disloyal, dishonest former Director of the FBI would probably not have been as honest as he was about some other things that were said.  But for anyone in the media to make some kind of big deal, potential obstruction of justice charge, just bringing up ``I need you to be loyal; tell me you will be loyal'' is absolutely outrageous.  I would expect every President, surely, if they were a good President, at one time or another needed to ask for a pledge of loyalty, not that you are going to lie, not that you are going to commit a crime, but you are not going to run out and leak stuff more than once the way James Comey did. You are going to be loyal to me. And if there is a problem, you come to me. You don't go leak it to your leftwing friends.  And also being loyal, I would think, would include that, if you believe there is a need for an independent counsel, a special counsel, and that you are a critical witness, that being loyal and being honest would--and being ethical would require that you not look forward to having one of your best friends in the world, Bob Mueller, being the special counsel.  My friends, my very dear friends, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Jody Hice--I have an article from yesterday. I have been talking about this for a week or so with different people, but we do need an independent counsel. We need a special counsel. And courts have made clear, Congress cannot appoint an independent counsel. It is an executive branch function. It is a violation of the separation of powers.  It has been made very clear: Congress can appropriate for independent counsel, they can make laws that create an office of independent counsel or a special prosecutor, they can do all those things, but they cannot, Congress cannot appoint an independent prosecutor, a special counsel. That is an executive branch function, and everyone in the executive branch derives their power, any that they have, from and through the President of the United  We know, there is no question about it, President Barack Hussein Obama regularly and intentionally obstructed justice, but we know that for a President to obstruct justice the way President Obama did was legal. He has the power to legally obstruct justice a number of ways, whether it is at the very end, just an outright pardon, or whether it is a dictation of policies the[[Page H5136]]way President Obama did: We are not going to go after and prosecute this group of people that have come in and committed crimes from other countries.  Some of us felt like it was terrible judgment, but President Obama had the legal authority to obstruct justice in directing the Justice Department not to pursue and prosecute certain groups of people or even individuals. He could pardon them outright before or after investigation. The President has that power. So does President  But as my friends point out in this article, Mr.Comey misled the American people in the early weeks of the Trump administration by furthering the perception that President Trump was under investigation when, in fact, he was not. He, again, did this willfully and intentionally, and, I would add, he did it disloyally and dishonestly.  They point out that Comey recently admitted that, after being fired from the FBI, he had a friend leak an internal FBI document to The New York Times detailing a conversation Comey had with President Comey testified under oath that he had ordered the leak to help create public momentum for the appointment of a special counsel, which we now know is Comey's mentor, predecessor, dear friend, Robert  Unless anyone be confused--and I have even heard our great Speaker of the House say: Yeah, well, you know, the fact is his credentials are impeccable. We trust him.  Well, anybody who looks into Mueller's situation deeply enough will not say that his credentials are impeccable. He served honorably, heroically in Vietnam, but as FBI Director, he set a policy in place that would run people out of the FBI that had years of service and experience as supervisors. One article pointed out, he had run off thousands and thousands of years of experience.  I would submit it is because his egotistical narcissism would not allow him to have anybody that knew more than he did so they could question or offer suggestions contrary to what Director Mueller wanted. That is why he cost the FBI millions of dollars. And because of his poor leadership, his purging of the FBI training materials so that all these new people, after he ran off the experienced people that knew what radical Islam was--they had been trained to recognize it--ran them off, had younger people in there who were not allowed to learn what radical Islam was, so when the Orlando shooter or Tsarnaev or any of these others that were on the radar were investigated by Mueller's trained FBI, they didn't know what they were looking for. Because of the poor training--it wasn't intentional by Mueller that they would end up costing people their lives, but that is what happened.  An article points out: ``On May 7, 2014, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for a special counsel to investigate the IRS targeting of conservatives for their political beliefs. Comey and Attorney General Eric Holder blocked the appointment. This despite the fact that the lead investigator they assigned to the case, Barbara Bosserman, was a max-out contributor to President Obama's reelection campaign.  ``This is the type of unequal justice the Americans despise. No special counsel in the IRS targeting investigation. No special counsel for the Clinton email investigation. But if it's about protecting Comey's reputation and hurting President Trump, then of course there has to be a special counsel.  ``Throughout 2015 and 2016 there were calls from Congress for a special counsel in the Clinton email scandal.''  I mean, for heaven's sakes, when you have someone go out and destroy known evidence that has been subpoenaed with a hammer, now that is illegal obstruction of justice.  But, no, Comey didn't want that investigated. Oh, no, his dear friend Hillary Clinton, the dear couple that was so close to Loretta Lynch that she would order him to misrepresent what the FBI was doing, that she would get on a plane knowing he is the spouse of somebody they are supposed to be looking at prosecuting, that there is plenty of evidence to show she violated the law many times, criminal law many times, oh, no. But this Justice Department refused, even after it was revealed that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with Bill Clinton less than a week before the FBI interviewed Hillary                              {time}  1245  No special counsel was established, even allowed, or even recommended, even after some unusual Justice Department immunity deals, the deals the Justice Department made with Comey there as Director when he, apparently, was a big enough shot he could do his job and Loretta Lynch's; say, I'm not going to let anybody--what he said was no good prosecutor, in essence, would prosecute this case.  That was a lie, but he went before the public to say it to help his friends, the Clintons or, rather, better friends of Loretta Lynch and the  Boy, if President Trump had ever gotten the loyalty from James Comey that President Obama got, in numerous cases, undeservedly, people would be recognizing prior criminal activity for what it was and is.  Anyway, in one of the hearings, Mueller was asked about this incredible, horrendous activity of persecuting conservative organizations, refusing to allow them to form because they could go against President Obama in the next election. The Obama administration clearly used the IRS as one of its most effective campaign operative groups, and it worked. They were able, in 2012, to prevent conservative groups from forming and from coming after President Obama for problems he had created.  But with all the national furor over the IRS, Mr.Mueller was supposed to be so fair, so impartial. He is asked: Well, we're told we don't need a special counsel because you, the FBI, are all over this. You don't need any special prosecutor. You've got this under control. Who is the lead agent?  He couldn't answer the question.  He is asked: Well, how many agents have been assigned to the case?  Mueller could not answer that question.  He is asked: Have any victims been interviewed?  The answer again was: I don't know.  The reason was Mueller is not objective. He is not fair and balanced. He despises this President, like his and Comey's friends at The Washington Post, The New York Times, and elite circles. They have shown they are and have been disloyal to the They have been unjust to this  And Mueller, I mean, going back to when William Jefferson was being investigated, I haven't seen the articles in many years, but I do recall, because we were paying attention, when Mueller had a congressional office searched without having--there are many times Members of Congress have potentially probable cause they committed a crime, and the way it was always handled, for over 200 years, you go to the Speaker of the House, because things in a Member of Congress' office--like, at that time, nobody should have come into my office, even with a warrant from the FBI, and been able to get material that said what FBI agents were giving me information about the terrible administration in the  The only way we can have a balance of power and the only way we can have oversight is if the FBI has no right to come in and find out who the whistleblowers are, because they do come after them. We have seen that over and over.  But Mueller was out for blood. They get a search warrant. Forget 200 years of law. We are not going through the Speaker so they can preserve things that are privileged that the FBI shouldn't get. Always in the past--there have been many people prosecuted with things that came from their office, as I understood it.  I was in on one of the meetings between the Attorney General's lawyers, the House lawyers, and the They said: You know, many times we have given you--when you show us what it is, we make sure what is privileged stays privileged and give you the evidence that lets you prosecute.  But Mueller went straight there, as a smack at Congress: You better not have oversight of me, or I will come after you.  And when he was questioned about this issue that Congress was raising, his response was: Maybe it's time I appointed 400 agents to investigate Congress.[[Page H5137]]  He was threatening  This is mean-spirited. This is an unfair, unjust man. And there is only one answer because he leaked out, ``I am investigating the President for obstruction of justice.'' Now if the President fires him, oh, it will be another Saturday night massacre.  So the answer is that the President has all the authority to appoint special counsel. He has got to appoint somebody to investigate Mueller, his chummy buddy Comey, their chummy buddy Loretta Lynch, and the Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton couple so we can finally find out truth, honesty, and loyalty in this country.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-23-pt1-PgH5134.txt,1801,JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH,2017.0,23.0,May
1286,topic-id,806,"Mr.Speaker, I will admit that I am pleased that the deal[[Page H3072]]worked out between Democratic leadership and Republicans to keep the government open until October does not include funding for the President's ``tremendous'' border wall. But let's put that in perspective.  A border wall will not deport thousands of people living and working in cities across the Nation or moms and dads in my neighborhood. A border wall will not deport anyone, and I seriously doubt it would do any good keeping anyone out, either.  Building a 3,000-mile wall is a hugely expensive boondoggle to solve a policy problem many say we don't have. Border apprehensions have been going down steadily for years, and now we have people fleeing violence and persecution who are so scared of us they are deciding not to come to America and are applying for asylum somewhere else. They are not taking their legitimate claims for political asylum and safety to the Nation that is the hallmark of freedom.  So while even Donald Trump admits that border apprehensions are significantly down, he says, 75 percent, it is not necessarily for reasons we should be proud of.  But a wall? Are policy experts and pundits really discussing whether fifth century technology plays a role in modern homeland security? The Great Wall of China boosts tourism. It is not a factor in national security.  What concerns me more is the spending on deportation that is still in the bill we will be voting on today. $1.2 billion of Trump's original $3 billion request for border security and interior enforcement is still there. Any money we give those agencies at this point will find its way into funding the President's mass deportation agenda.  Now, imagine if we were applauding the approval of a budget that had $1.2 billion in new funding to roll back Roe v. Wade, additional funding from the Federal Government to restrict women's healthcare and reproductive rights. Well, I would never vote for that budget.  But what if Trump asked us for $3 billion but we only gave him $1.2 billion to undermine workplace safety laws and labor rights? I would never do that.  Let's just say it was $1.2 billion to defeat environmental regulations that protect clean air and water. Would we celebrate? I don't think so.  Would we celebrate $1.2 billion in additional money to weaken the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts? Would we celebrate more money to combat and weaken same-sex marriage or take away transgender rights? I wouldn't.  Adding $1.2 billion to the budget to make it easier for the U.Government to deport people should never be celebrated by any of us, and certainly not in the era of Trump when we know their number one policy priority is to scare immigrants into leaving or not coming in the first place.  Look, the people who will be deported with the money we are voting on are usually people with no criminal background and deep roots in their communities. They are parents, teachers, businessowners, mostly people of color, who have lived and worked here a long time and are here, in many cases, seeking refuge, as is their right under our laws and international law.  Yes, some are dangerous criminals, but don't believe the hype. The Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are overhauling who we define as serious criminals so they can make their deportation force look benign and sometimes even beneficial.  Mr.Speaker, I will not be voting for the omnibus bill because I don't believe that it is okay to slip another billion here or there into the budget to break up and destroy families, put moms and dads in detention, and send DREAMers out of the country--the only country they have ever known.  I have looked into the eyes of children, of kids, U.citizens, whose parents have been deported. I have spoken to teachers in Chicago and across the country who have to deal with the fear in their students' lives every day. I have worked for decades with families who have complied--yes, for decades, I have worked with families who have complied with every order they have been given by Homeland Security and have reported to authorities like clockwork, but now when they report, they are deported from the United States of  I cannot turn around and bless more money for the machinery that is grinding up families. I just won't do it. And I will not turn my back on the immigrant community of the United States of America by supporting funding that will be used to detain immigrants in private jails and put them on airplanes out of the country.  Mr.Speaker, as long as we are going to shortchange health care in Puerto Rico and subsidize the deportation of families in Chicago, the budget will not have my vote.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgH3071-5.txt,478,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,3.0,May

1157,topic-id,747,"Mr.Speaker, today I have the front page cover of Douglas Wissing's book, ``Funding the Enemy: How U.Taxpayers Bankroll the Taliban.'' A few years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting with Douglas in my office here in D.to discuss his book.  One of the analyses of this book by the Publishers Weekly said: `` `Funding the Enemy' is sober, sad, and important . . . it peels back the layers of American engagement in Afghanistan to reveal its rotten core: that United States dollars meant for that country's future instead fund the insurgency and support the Paying for both sides of the war ensures America's ultimate defeat, and Wissing's book tells the story.''  Mr.Speaker, I am reminded of this book as we recently heard President Trump talk about how he would allow General Mattis to recommend troop level increases in I am disappointed for many reasons. I am disappointed because Congress deserves a debate and a vote, and I am disappointed because we continue to lose American lives.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to remind the administration of comments that President Trump made a few years ago regarding Afghanistan:  First, in August of 2011, he said that the United States was wasting lives and money in Iraq and  In 2012, President Trump referred to Afghanistan as a ``complete waste'' and also declared it was ``time to come home.''  Then again the next year, he made many comments on the Twitter feed, first saying: ``Do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan through 2024--with all costs by USA.''  He further tweeted: ``Let's get out of Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Rebuild the USA.''  That is what President Trump said, and I agree with President Trump.[[Page H5394]]  Returning to the book, ``Funding the Enemy'' shows: ``With the vague intention of winning hearts and minds in Afghanistan, the U.Government has mismanaged billions of development and logistics dollars, bolstered the drug trade, and dumped untold millions into Taliban hands.''

1092,topic-id,896,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Boyle and Congressman Veasey for their leadership and the new energy and the innovative ideas that they bring here from their constituency on behalf of our country. It is a privilege to join you tonight and talk about the infrastructure of our country, a major infrastructure bill, and it is certainly appropriate during this infrastructure week.  The whole vital topic of investing in a national infrastructure plan and investing in those who will help to modernize America translates into good jobs, as Congressman Veasey has talked about, and progress for America that Congressman Boyle has talked about.  When we think about infrastructure, some people only think about roads and bridges, and we certainly need attention to those across our country. So many places throughout our Nation are in desperate need of repair. Frankly, the street I live on, there is a big sinkhole at the end of the street.  Mr.Speaker, 17 percent of the roads in Ohio, my home State, are in poor condition, according to the American Society of Civil They estimate that the average Ohio driver pays an extra $475 a year from driving on roads in need of repair. Look no further than me. I had to pay $500 for a whole front end because of hitting a big pothole driving at home at night. So we know how much it costs.  Let me urge President Trump and the administration not to limit their thinking on an infrastructure bill. Infrastructure should be about our roads and bridges for sure, but it should go far beyond that for modernizing the  As the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee for Energy and Water Development, I take very seriously America's responsibility to modernize the country for this new century.  Our energy grid desperately needs an update, and power outages across this country attest to that. Our waterways need help, too. And our drinking water infrastructure, just in Ohio it is estimated will cost $12.2 billion over the next 20 years.  As hard as it is to fathom, and I am sure the President hasn't had a chance to read the fine print on this, but the President's budget office proposed to zero out the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which is so vital to fresh drinking water in our vast region. The President has said he wants to help the people in Flint, He campaigned there several times. But it is not an either/or. It is both/and. You have to have funding in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to take care of the water issues confronting the Great Lakes where algal blooms get larger and larger every year due to phosphorus and nitrogen runoff.  Our waterways, our drinking water, are vital components of our national infrastructure. Over 11 million people just on Lake Erie alone, the lake that I represent, need that fresh water. The systems are very old. Some estimate in the cities, cities are losing 30 percent or more of the water distribution underground because of aging pipelines. We truly need to look both above the ground and underneath it.  Through many of the counties that I represent, there are old septic systems in place, and 40 percent or more of[[Page H4305]]them are leaking. They contribute to some of the problems that we are having in our fresh water systems. These communities need a helping hand and extra financing to help put their wastewater systems into compliance.  I have also proposed a bill for a 21st century civilian conservation corps for needed investments in our States and national parks and forests. Ohio and Michigan alone need to plant 20 million trees to replace those that have been damaged by invasive species.  I wanted to also mention, I represent, and I know Congressman Boyle and Congressman Veasey, we represent urban communities, and many of those communities have housing that is 100 years old. Some a little more, some a little less. Imagine if infrastructure could include weatherization so we could place new roofs on millions of homes across this country. We could train people how to do this. We could help bring up the younger generation.  Also windows and insulation. If we look at the condition of America's housing stock, particularly following the collapse of 2008, if we look at saving Americans money that they currently spend on wasting energy because they can't afford to put on a new roof, windows, or insulate their homes, we could help millions of As we help to improve America's infrastructure, I really believe housing has an important role to play in this regard, especially with energy conservation.  Honestly, as I close my remarks tonight, and I thank Congressman Boyle and Congressman Veasey for their leadership, Mr.Speaker, it is not only rewarding to work with them, it is fun, too.  Mr.Speaker, Americans have been waiting for us and the Federal Government to really give them a helping hand up. I know working together on a bipartisan basis, we can produce an infrastructure bill that the country has been waiting for, as Congressman Boyle says, for decades. I know that our mayors, our county commissioners, and our Governors across the country would work hand in hand with us, and I think Americans from coast to coast would applaud what we are able to do here in order to help our country rebuild itself in this new century.

Even though Danielle is not a native of Maine, she has, in every regard, embraced, cherished, and served the State just as any Mainer would. Under her tenure, UNE grew from 4,000 students to more than 10,000, increased its operating surplus by $127 million, expanded its campuses in Biddeford and Portland while opening a campus in Tangier, Morocco--making UNE the only U.institution of higher education to own a study-abroad campus specifically designed for the needs of science students--and launched three new colleges within the university. Additionally, in the midst of a national crisis over student loans, Danielle presided over one of the lowest default rates nationally on student loans at only 2.5 percent, even with 95 percent of students at the university taking out loans.

The journey of a championship team is not merely a story of glory or success, but rather an aggregation of hard work, sportsmanship, and persistence. Today I wish to extend recognition to a team in Maine whose perseverance and teamwork have made them a force to be reckoned with each season. I am proud to highlight the achievements of the Lewiston High School Blue Devils competition cheerleading team who, on the path to their third consecutive Class A State title for the sixth time in the last seven seasons, have demonstrated a remarkable level of drive, ambition, and pride towards achieving success.  Lewiston High School's nationally recognized and distinguished competition cheer program has a long history of talent and teamwork symbolic of the pride felt for the Blue Devils throughout the community. As the eighth consecutive Class A North/East Regional Champions, the cheer team has experienced few losses in recent years, but the program and student-athletes see each challenging loss as an opportunity to work harder and be stronger. The Blue Devils fulfilled that promise and more this past season. After a loss in the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference, KVAC, the team responded with an impressive display of discipline and grit when they exceeded expectations and won the State title with a score of 95--representative of a nearly seamless routine.  The Lewiston cheer program is much more than a team of exceptional student-athletes. These talented and aspiring young people have contributed to a cheer dynasty that inspires young athletes and is recognized as a premier program throughout the The pride felt for the program, team members, peers, and the Lewiston community at large shows the level of dedication and ambition that has led to so many impressive successes.  I wish to join the city of Lewiston and the entire Maine community in congratulating the Lewiston High School competition cheering team for their well-earned recognition. The program has built a legacy of success, instilling core values of hard work, perseverance, and sportsmanship and imbues all that is significant about participation and competition in sport at any level.

My great-grandmother was Elizabeth Philhower  The Philhowers were some of the earliest settlers of Hunterdon County, New The patriarch of the Philhower family was Philip Wulhauer, who emigrated from Germany on the ship the Patience, landing in the port of Philadelphia on September 16, 1738, at the age of 24. He met his wife, Anna Maria, on their voyage to the Together they traveled to Hunterdon County, New Jersey, to start a new life.  Philip went on to lease 14 acres in what is now Tewksbury Township in 1758 and established the Philhower homestead, which was first a log cabin that included one room and a loft. Shortly after, he built the house that still stands on the property. It was constructed of mortar, lime, sand, and clay, and its walls are 18 inches thick.  The Philhower homestead had grown to 100 acres when the house was completed. The Philhowers have occupied the land since then and have spread their roots all over Hunterdon County, all over the State of New Jersey, and, indeed, all over the rest of the country.  Among the family names entwined in the Philhowers are Apgar, Sutton, Fleming, Hoffman, and Philhowers have represented Hunterdon County in many of the military conflicts that have faced our They have also been farmers, millers, physicians, ministers, merchants, bankers, and educators.  In 1917, the Philhowers held their first family reunion at their homestead, attended by nearly 400 descendants of Philip and Anna This fine tradition has continued over the last century, usually marked by a turkey dinner, finance meeting, and exchanging of family mementos at Cokesbury United Methodist Church in Hunterdon This year, however, family members will travel back to the[[Page H5439]]original Philhower homestead to be together.

We could have passed all of the bills separately in  I would also note, as the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska said on the floor a few minutes ago, that Republicans and Democrats have been working very closely on this appropriations bill. She expressed--and I absolutely join her in this--that we go back to the way it always has been. My party is not in control of the schedule in the Senate, but I would ask that all of us in both parties work together and start doing the appropriations bills one by one, as we always have. In fact, this bill is the product of many long weeks and days and nights and weekends. I know. A lot of times, I went to bed at midnight, and my staff kept on working.  I thank Republican Chairman Thad Cochran, of Mississippi, for his leadership in reaching this agreement of keeping the government open for business. It is how Congress can and should work.  Forget the rhetoric. Forget political brinkmanship. This agreement shows something we have worked on and that when we come together and work through our differences--both parties here and both parties in the other body--that we can do the work of the American people.  I think the package before us is a good deal for the American people, and I will vote for it, but we should not be celebrating this fact. On this, I agree with the distinguished Senator from Arizona in that we should not be finishing our work 7 months into the fiscal year. I wish his party had allowed us to do it last These bills could have been and should have been finished then. In fact, we were 98 percent done with our negotiations, both Republicans and Democrats, when then-President-elect Trump said: Pencils down, and put everything on hold. The Senator from Arizona and his party have been operating on a continuing resolution ever since. I am glad to hear him say this is not the way he wants to do it.  I, certainly, agree with the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska when she says this is not the way to do it. Those of us who have been here for a while know that does not work and it is no way to govern.  It is my goal--and I believe Chairman Cochran shares this goal--to return to regular order, which is when we consider each appropriations bill in committee, debate each one publicly on the floor, and then vote it up or down. That is the way we should operate. That is what the American people deserve. I look forward to working with Chairman Cochran to make this a reality when we return, in very short order, to the fiscal year 2018 bills.  I have been on the Appropriations Committee for decades, and I have served as either chairman or ranking member of different subcommittees there, just as I have served as chairman or ranking member on Agriculture and the Yet I decided this year to take on the vice chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee because I believe in the power of the purse, in the ability of this committee to make a real difference in people's lives, and because of the respect I have for Chairman  Our national budget is a reflection of our Nation's priorities, and the appropriations bills are where our priorities become realities.

I am pleased that on a bipartisan basis we have rejected President Trump's ill-considered proposal to slash domestic programs by $15 billion, including deep cuts in the NIH and low-income energy assistance. I am glad to see a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of I was proud to have brought then-Vice President Biden to the University of Vermont last October to discuss his Cancer Moonshot Initiative and to see and hear how Vermonters are contributing to research to better treat--and hopefully cure--cancer. NIH funding is central to this effort.  Last year, the NIH accounted for nearly $40 million in research funding for the University of Everybody--Republicans and Democrats--agree they have spent it well. This research is leading to advancements in lung disease treatments, cancers, and to more effectively using genome testing to advance the emerging and promising field of precision medicine.  In this bill, we were able to protect funding for As the distinguished Presiding Officer and I know, we are in States in which the temperatures can often plunge way below zero. LIHEAP is a vital lifeline--certainly in the State of Vermont--to prevent people from being forced to make the wrenching choice of putting food on their tables for their families or keeping them warm.  We have also put in $512 million--nearly double the resources available last year--to combat the opioid epidemic. This is a plague that grips every community in the country.

It is a problem that does not know the difference between rich or poor, urban or rural, Republican or I think every Senator probably knows someone or a family with someone who has been in the grips of opioid addiction.

He certainly has led that effort, and that is the way we should do it.  I mentioned this when the Vermonters were here last weekend. Marcelle and I hosted them, so many of whom had driven through the night to join the hundreds of thousands of people in the Nation's Capital for the Climate Many of them asked: Why can't we do it the way we used to?

Those of us on the Appropriations Committee have read this bill, and we have read most of it since last  The EPA provides funding to improve the environmental quality and ecological vibrancy of our small State's great Lake Champlain, the jewel of New England, as well as crucial funding for similar partnerships all over the country.  I am also pleased to report what is not in this bill. In a bipartisan way, we get rid of more than 160 poison pill riders--riders that would have undermined the health insurance of millions of Americans by attacking the protections they have under the Affordable Care Act and riders that would have slapped restrictions on women's access to healthcare, especially in rural areas, and riders that would have rolled back consumer financial protections of Dodd-Frank regulations and weaken environmental protections. Let's have votes up or down on those issues, anytime you want, but not in a must-pass spending bill.  I also particularly welcome the fact that not a single cent in the bill will go toward building President Trump's misguided wall on the southern border. When that issue came up in our debate, I said: Well let's have a vote, up or down, in the House and in the Senate, on the wall, where all Republicans and all Democrats vote. If it passes, then I will stop my objection. Nobody wants such a vote because not enough people support it. The American people should not, and they will not, be forced to pay tens of billions of dollars for a bumper-sticker solution to an incredibly complex problem--a wall that the President promised that Mexico, not American taxpayers, would pay for, even though all American taxpayers know that Americans, not Mexicans, would pay for it. His own department estimates that it would cost U.taxpayers $22 billion. Some said during the debate: Show me a 30-foot wall, and I will show you a 31-foot ladder. I can also show you pictures of small prop planes and boats and tunnels. A wall is nothing more than an illusion. It is a false promise of security. Instead of debating this boondoggle, which Democrats as well as Republicans and Independents oppose, let's consider real solutions with comprehensive immigration reform.  In 2013, the Senate passed the large effort of Republicans and Democrats working together on comprehensive immigration reforms. Let's resume that debate and not throw money at this expensive illusion, where we are cutting vital medical research at the National Institutes of Health and others to pay for it.  There are a lot of anti-science proposals and impulses in the proposals that came from the administration, and I am proud that both Republicans and Democrats rejected them.  So I support the bill before us. I am proud to join with Chairman It is not a perfect bill, but no products we all come together on are perfect. But on balance, it is a good deal for the American people. It reflects values of both Republicans and The bipartisan work that brought us to this point shows what is possible and it lays the groundwork for our negotiations on the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills.  So I want to extend again my thanks to Chairman Cochran and to the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members. It takes a tremendous amount of work to draft each of the underlying bills contained in this consolidated appropriations bill. While we were negotiating, I remember being on the phone at 10, 11 o'clock at night, night after night, but I went to bed, and the staff would keep on working until 2 or 3 in the morning.  So I thank the staff of the Appropriations Committee and subcommittee clerks on both sides of the aisle, who have been here day in and day out for many weeks. I certainly thank my staff director, Charles ``Chuck'' Kieffer, deputy staff director Chanda Betourney, and Jessica Berry, Jay Tilton, JP Dowd, and Jean Kwon, as well as Senator Schumer and his staff, including Gerry Petrella, Meghan Taira, Mike Lynch, and Mike Kuiken for the assistance they provided. I want to recognize and thank Bruce Evans and Fitz Elder from Chairman Cochran's staff, the majority staff director, and deputy staff director. They worked very, very hard and in their usual professional and courteous manner. I want to thank Bob Putnam, Hong Nguyen, and George Castro for the support they provide to the committee every day. And finally, I want to thank the editorial and printing staff, without whom we could never have produced this bill. Valerie Hutton, Penny Myles, Elmer Barnes and Karinthia Thames were here day and night, week after week, editing the dozens of drafts that ultimately became this consolidated bill. They work in relatively obscurity, but their expertise and dedication is not lost on us. We depend on them and we greatly appreciate what they do.  Lastly, on a personal matter, I wish to take a moment for special recognition of Charles Chuck is well known to the He is a familiar figure here in this He has served on the Appropriations Committee for many years, under numerous chairmen and vice chairmen. I was grateful that he was willing to take on and continue there when I took over as vice chairman.  What a lot of people don't know is that he has been working around the clock on this, and in March he lost his father Just a few weeks ago, he lost his mother  If you know even a little bit about his parents, there is no doubt where Chuck gets his dedication to public service. His father Jerry served as the executive director of the National Cultural Center at the Kennedy He held positions in the Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations.

1127,topic-id,3783,"Mr.Speaker, I rise on the heels of Memorial Day to discuss what we must learn from those we specifically remember on this and every Memorial Day going forward.  All among us, every single person in this Chamber, every single person that visits here, we all have those days of the year where the history that is buried down deep inside of us is stirred up for whatever reason that may be. For some of us maybe it is that we lost a loved one right around Christmas and now we can't get through the holidays without remembering that person each year and the ways in which that person touched our life.  Maybe for others it was right around your birthday when you lost a loved one or somebody passed, and on each year on the celebration of your own life, you find yourself remembering the loss of that life, the loss of that friend.  Maybe for you that history is buried down inside and gets stirred up because of a certain smell in the air that brings you back to a time and place in your life. It can be hearing a special song that had meaning and somehow connected that person to you.  For others, maybe it is driving past a certain restaurant or an intersection or a park that really weighs heavily on your heart.  I find those feelings each and every day as I look down at my wrist and I read these bracelets with the names of friends who left this world in the most honorable way that any person can: in defense of our  Men like Army Ranger Medic Jonathan On his fourth tour in Afghanistan, he died on June 1, 2010, from wounds that he sustained while giving medical aid to another wounded He was only 22 years old. When I speak to his mother, I know just how much she misses him.  Or Army Sergeant Justin He was killed on July 18, 2010. I can remember the last thing that I said to him. I remember the mission vividly that we were on, and I remember the Rangers who spoke about him the next day on the flight line as we sent him home.  I remember Bradley Rappuhn and Andrew Nicol and the compound that we were assaulting when they passed.  You know, for me and many others across this Nation, the day that stands out above all for us is a day that is just a few days from now. It is Memorial Day, the day that America has specifically set aside to remember the men and women that relinquished their life while serving in the United States Armed And it rests as the day that is most heavy on our hearts.  This day is so heavy on my heart that, to my shame, one year I asked my wife, Brianna, that she and our children, Magnum and Maverick, not accompany me to the cemetery that I was going to be speaking at that Memorial I asked that she stay at home with our two little boys.  I made that request because I didn't want my little boys to have to see me in pain. And at that point in life, I just wasn't strong enough. I wasn't strong enough to tell them why their daddy had tears or was crying on that day.  And today I try to be more courageous, and I try to tell my boys why I have tears on that and every Memorial And whenever I hear the slow solemn hum of taps, whether it is on Memorial Day or Veterans Day or in the presence of some newly fallen comrade or playing on a TV in the background, I have to pause and wipe my eyes and regain my composure.  Or when I hear that cold crack of a 21-gun salute, I do find myself too numb to the sound of gunfire to be startled by it, but it still reverberates to my core as though I was struck by the shots myself. That is the pain that I feel.  You know, those little boys of mine, they need to know that there were brave men and brave women who showed strength and courage and patriotism with every fiber of their being on their behalf so that they may live free. That they may live free.  Think about that. They served never thinking about personal gain or personal sacrifice, but thinking about their personal contribution to our And as we find ourselves on the heels of Memorial Day, I believe every Member of this House, every Member of Congress, must reflect on every tear shed across this Nation, every empty seat at every dinner table, every name etched onto a piece of stone that is for a son or daughter of America who gave everything for the freedom and the life of others.  We in this Chamber must think daily about all the men and women who have fought and died for this cause, this Nation that they loved more than their own breath.  I think about those that I knew personally, those that I have heard about. I think about those who came long before me. And I ask myself every single day: Would they be proud of the work that we do in this Chamber, how we represent our Nation and the values that they fought for that they gave their life for? Would they want us as a member of their team?  I used to tell folks that, to date, in our theaters of war, I have lost 67 close friends. That used to be true. But the reality is I no longer know how many friends I have lost. I have stopped counting. What I know is that we must live the way that they lived every day: without excuse, without regret. Full throttle, as one of my friends used to say.  For some of them, their blood has stained my own uniform. Some of them I lost simply being on the same mission. And some were on other missions[[Page H4596]]in other places around the world. And each year on Memorial Day and many other days, I think most often of one of my friends specifically, Ranger Sergeant First Class Lance Vogeler, who, after four tours in Iraq and eight tours in Afghanistan, made the ultimate sacrifice on October 1, 2010, while in battle just a few short days after my own injury.  I know that he is deeply missed by me and all of his friends, and certainly by his wife and his two children that he left behind. You know, I can remember him telling me about them one night as we were in Afghanistan and he and I sat against a fence in the dark of night waiting for a helicopter to come and pick us up. I can remember him telling me about his family. I wasn't there when he passed, but I am told that his last words were of his wife and of his children.  I think often if he would be proud of the way that this place conducts itself. He is the definition of a hero. He is exactly what Memorial Day honors. And knowing him, I know that none of us here can measure up, but I want to know that we honor him and every other hero who is remembered officially in just a few days with our actions in here each and every day. We owe it to men like him to fight to make America the strongest version of itself that it could ever be.  I want us to honor each of those close friends that I have lost in our theaters of war and every other who has traded their life for our freedom, for our America, with their own actions on each day.  As we approach Memorial Day, I always remember well a lot of things about those friends. I remember their smiles. And I remember the jokes that we would play on each other. I can remember hiding somebody's gear or adding a big rock into their pack without them knowing, just to weigh it down, make them sweat a little bit more. And I can remember where they were from. I can remember the time that we spent training together, shooting together, jumping out of aircraft together, roping from helicopters together, blowing things up together. I can remember their hobbies, and I can remember their plans for what they wanted to do whenever they returned home. I can remember the pictures that they themselves would carry in their breast pocket of the ones that they loved most, just like the one that I would carry of my wife, Brianna, and our one son that I had at that time. I can remember their lifesaving actions on the battlefield. I can remember their acts of valor, and I can remember the way that we each confidently put our lives in each other's hands.                              {time}  1230  I remember some who are no longer with us today who placed themselves in the line of fire to carry me from the battlefield that I not become a casualty of war. I can remember their loyalty and their determination and their grit, and, for some of them, I can remember their last breaths. I can remember saluting their casket with the most beautiful flag that I have ever seen draped gracefully across it, and I can remember seeing that flag folded and handed to those whose pictures they had been carrying. I can remember seeing the way that those family members would cling to that flag.  As I remember these moments, I want to see, more than anything, that the way we, here in the House of Representatives, conduct ourselves honors the way those who gave the last beat of their heart conducted themselves on our behalf. If statues of those men and women surrounded our floor here, would they look onto each of us each day and would they swell with pride over our service, or would their hearts sink? Would they turn away and be ashamed? Would they look on and be proud?  The goal of American heroes has always been country first, themselves second. They knew, those who gave on behalf of this place, that the establishment of this country, the maintenance of America, its safety, the protection of each and every citizen is not a product of chance. It is not a product of luck. It is not a product of indifference. So they stood between every American and evil with purpose and resolve regardless of what it was going to cost them.  They knew the job was never easy, it was never safe, it was always dangerous, and it was almost always deadly. While they may have disagreed on how to conduct a mission, I know they never wished for the failure of their comrade or, for that matter, the failure of any American ever. They certainly never wished for the failure of the leaders of our  My office is in the Rayburn House Office Building, and in one of our entrances is the name of each who has fallen in the war on terror listed year by year. All of those friends of mine are listed there. When I see them, I stop, and I think about them every single time. I wish that the name of every single American who has fallen well in defense of our Nation adorned each and every wall of this Chamber in here, as it does in my office building, that we would look on each time we speak on this floor and question ourselves as to whether our motives are as pure as their motives were.  Every American child, every adult, every man and woman has the limitless opportunities to enjoy their life, to become whatever it is in the world they want to be, to achieve whatever they have the courage to attempt and the determination and the fortitude to spend themselves in fully to accomplish. That limitless opportunity each citizen has and each of us in here in the House is afforded has been paid for with the blood and the spirit of men and women who traded their own life to fulfill an oath to our great  Their oath was the same that we as Members of Congress vow to fulfill: to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; to take that obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, so help us  And though we take that same oath, I know we do not always show the same commitment. Those heroes never thought about what was easy or popular to masses or what they would get out of their actions. It was not reelection on the line for them. It was their life on the line, and they gave it freely.  As I think about Memorial Day, I wish we could, daily, see every heroic name across our walls here and recall the harrowing stories of the Second World War and the over 400,000 U.Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine, Coastguardsman, and each and every Merchant Marine who fought and died in Europe and in the Pacific and in Africa for the freedom of the entire world from being ruled by an evil and intolerant empire. They died in places named Ardennes Forest and Midway and  I wish we thought about each vote we took and looked at the names of our over 36,000 servicemembers who would never return home from the frozen mud of Korea and think is that what they fought for at the Chosin I wish we could recount the names and the stories of the over 58,000 servicemembers who died in combat or while captured or who went through torture and starvation before giving their life or while missing as a part of the Vietnam war in places like Khe Sanh and  I wish we saw the names of the servicemembers who put their country first and themselves second while serving in the Dominican Republic or Iran or El Salvador or Beirut or Grenada or Panama or the Persian Gulf as we thought about what we will say when we are given the chance to speak on this floor and if our words would be worth even one second of their life.  I wish we could think about the Delta operators or the Army Rangers or the Black Hawk pilots who gave it all in the dusty sands of Somalia, Medal of Honor recipients like Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart, who volunteered to go into a situation that they knew would claim their life in order to save their fellow fighters. They were devoted to their duty, and their duty was to their brothers and to their country.  Or those who fought and died in Bosnia and Kosovo and on the USS Cole, and all those who fought in places that we may never know because of threats to us that we never even knew existed, we need to ask if they would give the last beat of their heart for the way in which we legislate our country.[[Page H4597]]  Most personally for me, I would think deeply on the thousands of soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, coastguardsmen who defended this country with the last beat of their heart in a place like Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria, would they be proud. These were the men and women who I served alongside, men and women who served selflessly and repeatedly year after year, knowing full well the hazards of their profession.  I couldn't be more proud than to have the few moments that I did with the best and the most honorable that our Nation has ever produced, who sacrificed their whole self because it was best for the men and women to their left and to their right in battle, because it was best for the freedom and the liberty and the security of every person. I don't know how to ever make the pain of their loss go away. I do know how to honor them. We do it with the way that we live each day going forward that they do not have the opportunity to live.  They would want every American to cherish the gift of freedom that they have been given by God, which was defended by those angels whose names are now etched in row after row of plain white markers in Arlington National They would want us all to live exactly as they lived: with no regrets, loving this country more than we loved ourselves, fighting as hard as they fought, never quitting, never giving up. We owe it to them to do so, to not ask ourselves what we can take for ourselves, but to ask what we, ourselves, can give.  I want my kids to grow up honoring these men and these women who have sacrificed. I want my young boys to know that they get to give me a hug or a smile, but there are men and women who are willing to risk never having one more of those from their own families, and I want them to live the way that those heroes lived. I want my children to know it is honorable to have the courage to mourn them, and I want them to have the resolve to not squander the opportunities which have been paid for with the selfless blood of every American warrior.  I get grief in my heart when I think of all those who have gone in defense of our flag, but I also think about each of the great warriors that they were, and I smile because there can be no more honorable way to leave this world than in a pile of brass while fighting for the greatest nation ever to be established on the face of this  We here need to think of the thousands who gave their lives selflessly, without expectation of anything in return, true selfless servants serving simply to do what was best for the United States of Some were infantrymen; some were mortarmen; some were engineers or tankers or something else. They were men and women who, through the ages, created the reputation and the legacy and the tradition that made me say: ``That is what I want to be. That is how I want to serve. That is how I want to help.''  Here, we must learn from those who we think about most on Memorial We need to look at them and their names and their lives and their stories and their sacrifice and demand the same thing out of ourselves. They pushed through the cold. They pushed through the snow. They pushed without adequate supplies. They fought back tanks. They always pushed forward in the face of bombarding artillery. They pushed so hard that their weapon would overheat. They pushed through trench foot. They did it with fixed bayonets, which they used to defend their own foxholes and then used them to carve our enemy out of their foxholes. They stayed in the fight when they were wounded, even though it would certainly mean a bitter end that was very far from home.  They did not stop because they were tired. They did not stop because they were exhausted or freezing or hungry. They did it even though they had to sleep on the ground or sleep in the field or sometimes never sleep at all. They only stopped when the job was done. They only stopped when the mission was accomplished. This is the grit with which Americans have always defended  We have taken that same oath in this House, and American heroes, they set the precedent for every generation about how to do that job. To do it for them was not just a job or a paycheck, it was a calling. It was a calling that few have the stomach to undertake and that, certainly, even fewer still are capable of ever doing. It requires uncommon characteristics such as courage and valor and selflessness.  Today those words are thrown around very lightly by many, but those we remember on Memorial Day have actually lived and breathed the definition of these characteristics.  They did it by flying aircraft or driving armored vehicles. They did it by setting sail with the most powerful fleet ever seen on our seas. They did it by yoking their bodies with a rifle or a pistol, by carrying hundreds of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of pounds of gear, wearing a helmet and explosives, carrying everything that they required to save the life of another servicemember as well as everything that they needed to survive for days or months on end.  They did it while being targeted by snipers, while having bombs or mortars or grenades hurled at them, while having an RPG fired at them. They did it while walking in fields of mines and improvised explosive devices. They did it by carrying that load for miles and days across mountains, across rolling hills, and through fields and forests and rivers.  They did it while carrying letters for their friends, which they promised to deliver to their family should anything ever happen to them. They did it while missing births and birthdays and ball games and bath times and holidays and every other good time that they missed with their families. They did it in the face of mortal combat. They did it while holding both the lives of their friends and the lives of our enemies in their hands.  We honor those we remember who are not with us today by taking no charge more seriously than honoring their sacrifice with the lives that we now live. What those heroes have done in defense of our Nation can never be taken away from them. We must remember that so, too, what we do here in defense cannot be taken away by the years that pass if we endeavor to be warriors, willing to defend America at any and all costs.  Those we remember are a testament to the importance of the values and ideals sewn into the fabric of our Nation, the absolutes. And all I can say is: Thank God for men and women like that, for creating such patriots for us to revere as the standard by which all other Americans should serve  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgH4595-2.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE",2017.0,25.0,July
1102,topic-id,2688,"Mr.President, I come to the floor, like many of my colleagues, shocked at the Republican majority's brazen, secretive effort to hijack the legislative process and pass a bill that would hurt millions of  I have served in public office for more than four decades, and never once in my 45 years as a mayor, a State legislator, a Congressman, or a Senator has it been so hard to understand the motivations of an opposing party. What kind of problems are Republicans trying to solve with legislation that raises premiums, reduces coverage, decimates Medicaid, and increases costs for everyone? Certainly not any of the concerns I have heard in New Never has someone come up to me at the local diner to say that their premiums are too low or that Medicaid covers too many children or that cancer patients don't pay enough out of pocket.  There is only one place in America where these bad ideas have any traction, and that is behind closed doors in Washington, where 13 Republican men are working on a secret bill to take healthcare away from millions of people and raise costs on millions and millions more. They want no transparency, no bipartisan input, no hearings.  Those are the same Republicans who in 2009 and 2010 accused Democrats of ramming healthcare reform through Congress too quickly. In fact, it was the majority leader who said at the time: ``This massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors without input from anyone.'' Even the Vice President--a Congressman at the time--said it is ``wrong for legislation that'll affect 100 percent of the American people to be negotiated behind closed doors.'' Mind you, all of these complaints came during what was a far more open, transparent process.  I sit on the Senate Finance I remember the process quite well. I remember our chairman at the time, Senator Baucus, bending over backward to get Republican input. We held 53 meetings--hearings, roundtables, briefings, and negotiations--on healthcare reform. Afterward, we held the longest Finance Committee markup in over 20 years--a markup that led to the adoption of nearly a dozen Republican amendments, on top of the two dozen amendments we accepted before the markup began.  Democrats also made huge bipartisan overtures on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions They, too, held a transparent process and adopted over 160 Republican amendments--160 Republican amendments.  Then and only then did we bring the bill to the floor of the Senate, and when we did, we spent 25 consecutive days in session debating the bill on the Senate floor in front of the American people.  In short, Democrats spent months making compromise after compromise in the hopes of getting Republicans on board, only to learn that they never had any intention of working with us at all. They never cared about expanding access to care or reducing prescription drug costs for seniors or making insurance affordable. They didn't work with us then, and they certainly are not working with us now.  Behind closed doors, 13 Republican men are debating just how many millions of Americans will lose their coverage under this bill. Is it 23 million? Is it 20 million? Is it 16 million? Behind closed doors, they are discussing just how high the age tax should be on middle-aged workers. Is it $8,000 a year or $10,000 a year or $12,000 a year?  Behind closed doors, they are picking and choosing which consumer protections to gut. Should they bring back lifetime limits on coverage, which is a real problem if you have a serious disease? Before, there were lifetime limits. So you had coverage, and then all of a sudden, you hit that ceiling. If you had challenges, for example, with cancer, and you expended all of your coverage, you still had an illness that needed to be treated. Now you were one illness away from bankruptcy.  Would you let patients with preexisting conditions sink or swim in high-risk pools, allowing insurers to once again charge women more than men simply because they are women? Same age, same bracket, same geography.  It is easy to see why Republicans want to keep this bill out of the public eye. If it is anything like the House version passed earlier this year, it is going to be a terrible, mean-spirited bill--a bill that the Congressional Budget Office said would take insurance away from 23 million people. It would raise premiums by 20 percent a year and price middle-aged consumers out of the market. It is a bill that, according to reports, even President Trump said is too mean. I have to tell you something. If a bill is too mean for President Trump, it is certainly too mean for New  Today, I understand that a comment was attributed to the He was meeting with a group of business leaders. He says he wants a health bill with heart--with heart. I can tell you, it is not this bill because the House bill--and, from what I am hearing, behind closed doors, the potential Senate bill--is a heartless bill.  I am not the only one with that view. I was glad that most of my New Jersey colleagues in the House of Representatives rejected this bill in a bipartisan way. Indeed, every House Democrat and nearly every House Republican in our delegation understood why this bill would devastate New  This bill will price thousands of New Jerseyans out of the private health insurance market, especially those nearing retirement age. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for a 60-year-old worker who earns $20,000 a year in Monmouth County will see their premiums increase by 900 percent--900 percent. That is an increase of nearly $9,000.  Every day, New Jerseyans are reaching out to tell me what is at stake in this debate and what this secretive effort will mean for their health and their financial security. Take Howard Fredrics, a 54-year-old constituent from Park Ridge who emailed to say:       Without subsidies provided under the ACA, my 51-year-old      wife and I would have no insurance. . . . We could not afford      premiums in excess of $1100 a month. . . . Without these      subsidies, millions will go uninsured and many of these      people, myself included, will die.  Of course, my Republican colleagues like to say their plan will give Americans more choice. We don't know what the plan is, but they keep saying--at least the House plan--we are going to give Americans more choice. But if all the choices are unaffordable, what good are they? What good is it to have ``more choices'' if you can't afford any of the choices?[[Page S3638]]  If they provide significantly less coverage, what good is it to say I have insurance when the moment I get sick, I don't have the coverage for it? So I have been paying for a policy that doesn't really help me at the moment I need it.  They also say their plan will give States more choice on how to run When you cut Medicaid by $800 billion, you leave States no choice but to scale back the health services they provide. That is not choice. That is not choice.  Leaving nursing home patients out in the cold, ending respite care for children with disabilities, denying low-income children a fair shot of the American dream--that is not choice.  New Jersey alone will face $30 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade--cuts that will not only leave thousands of families uninsured but, according to the Milken Institute, will cost New Jerseyans more than 41,000 jobs. It is no wonder Senate Republicans are terrified of having to defend this bill. It is a terrible, mean bill, and they don't have the guts to tell the American people what is in it, even though they want to pass it next week. If only they had the courage that so many New Jerseyans have shown me in recent weeks as I have toured our State--hard-working Americans who have been willing to share their personal healthcare stories.  It is not easy to share a serious illness you have with everybody in the world, but so compelled are they and so courageous, I would add, that they do. People like Irma Rivera, a constituent I recently met in Jersey City, told me about her battle with uterine cancer nearly a decade ago. She was fortunate to survive, but without the Affordable Care Act, she would be blacklisted by health insurance companies for the rest of her life, simply because she is a survivor of that cancer. Today Irma is covered and receiving world-class care.  I also met with Samantha Williams, a young mother in Burlington She told me about her son's brush with a life-threatening asthma attack. They were uninsured so they avoided going to the emergency room, as so many people do. The illness gets worse and worse, more consequential to your life, more consequential to the cost, but eventually his breathing got so bad, she had no choice. The doctor said if they had waited any longer, her son might have never made it. She credits Medicaid with saving his life.  I also want to know how my Republican colleagues can reconcile their concern with the opioid epidemic with their plan to end the Medicaid expansion that is saving so many lives. Just yesterday, I received an email from Irene in Oakhurst, She writes:       My daughter is a recovering drug addict on the Medicaid      program which pays for mental health care and services. . . .      She's part of the opioid epidemic that has taken the lives of      so many young people like her. She's been drug free for      almost a year. Taking money from this program would be      disastrous not only for her but for so many people who cannot      afford any other healthcare.  So I listen to those compelling stories. They are courageous to tell their stories to the whole world--very personal stories. Yet there isn't the courage here to come forth with a bill and let's debate it open, in public. This bill leaves millions of low-income Americans who depend on Medicaid expansion with no options at all. And for what? To give insurance health executives, real estate moguls, and hedge fund managers a massive tax cut they don't need. If there was ever such a thing as class warfare, this is it.  In my home State of New Jersey, 250 millionaires are slated to get a collective tax cut of $14 million. You heard it right--250 millionaires get a tax cut, while over half a million New Jerseyans lose their healthcare coverage. That is a pretty awesome thought--an incredible thought. It is totally mean-spirited. It is certainly without heart. Many of them are people who work in some of the toughest jobs, but they don't get healthcare benefits at the job where they work, from dishwashers and cashiers and home health aides, just to mention a few. These were my neighbors growing up in the tenement in Union City--people who worked tirelessly to give their children a better life and so often put their own health on the back burner.  Many of us thought the cruel legislation Republicans passed through the House would be dead on arrival in the Instead, an incredibly unpopular bill has a new lease on life. Why? Because padding the pockets of the health insurance industry, capping Medicaid spending, and cutting taxes for millionaires have been at the top of Republican wish lists for years.  The notion that the GOP can pass this secret bill with no debate is insulting to our democracy, and the idea that they can dismantle this historic law without hurting millions of people is just not true because, make no mistake, when you take $800 billion out of Medicaid, everyone feels the pain. When you add 23 million people to the ranks of the uninsured, everyone feels the pain. When you send more people back to the emergency room as their way of getting healthcare, saddle consumers with higher out-of-pocket costs, and end protections against insurance company abuses for patients, everyone feels the pain.  What really boggles my mind--what I just can't understand is, there is no shortage of problems in our healthcare system--real problems that need real solutions. Ask anyone, and I mean anyone, about our healthcare system. I will guarantee you will get an earful about what is wrong with it. You will hear from parents about deductibles that are too high, from workers about how hard it is to find in-network doctors, from seniors about generic drugs that suddenly cost thousands of dollars, police officers about the opioid crisis tearing apart our communities, and hospital staff concerned about the nursing shortage, business owners, like the group I met from Cumberland County, NJ, yesterday who want Congress to work in a bipartisan way to lower employees' healthcare costs.  Imagine, just for a moment, how thrilled Americans would be if Republicans actually had a bill that solved some of their problems instead of bringing back old ones. Imagine how excited my Republican colleagues would be to show off a bill that improved, instead of endangered, people's lives, but my Republican friends are not excited to show off this bill because when you are excited to show a bill--when you have a great product, you want the whole world to know about it. When you have a terrible product, you don't want anyone to know about it, and they don't want to defend it because they know it is indefensible.  For 7 years, my Republican colleagues put politics over policy. For 7 years, they demonized ObamaCare, with no substance behind their rhetoric. Now their poll-tested platitudes have caught up with them, and they know it. That is why they let 13 Senators, who represent less than one-quarter of the country, meet behind closed doors, and that is why their hope is to keep this bill a secret until the very last minute.  So today I have come to the floor with a message for my Republican colleagues: If you want to have a debate about how to improve our healthcare system and about how to help more families get covered and about how to lower costs more and create a healthy, more productive nation, these are issues Democrats have been ready to have that debate on. I have said it in the Senate Finance We did remarkable things under the Affordable Care Act, but there is still room for improvement. We are ready to have that debate because Democrats know that while the Affordable Care Act was a historic law--a law that stopped insurance companies from dropping your coverage if you got sick, that covered 90 percent of Americans for the first time in our history, that required healthcare plans to cover essential health benefits like visits with specialists, prenatal care, mental health and addiction treatment, hospital stays, and more--despite all of the positive steps forward, in spite of all the good the Affordable Care Act did, Democrats have never stopped believing we could even make it better.  Before we can make our health system better, we must stop Republicans from making it worse. We cannot go back to a time when healthcare was a privilege granted only to those who could afford it, when it was always, I think, a right afforded to all The only way we can go forward is by working together with bipartisan input, with open debate, with full transparency on an issue that affects virtually every American, in full view[[Page S3639]]of the American people we were elected to serve. They deserve no less, but they are getting a lot less by the majority as it relates to this bill--behind closed doors, in secret, that even the President of the United States says is mean. The only thing I can agree with President Trump on is we need a bill with heart, and from what I have seen and heard so far, this is pretty heartless.  I yield the floor.

1169,topic-id,2547,"Mr.President, I compliment our colleague from Florida on his articulating this powerful vision for humankind, which is the ability to look into the night sky and ponder the mysteries of the universe, the mysteries of life, in the most complete way. America has led this scientific adventure, this scientific journey, and we must continue to be at the lead of this journey for all of the reasons he has laid out today.  I thank my colleague from Florida for leading Congress in pursuing and advocating for this vision and for developing the instruments on the ground and the instruments in space that will advance our knowledge.                              Equality Act  Mr.President, I rise to speak about a different vision, the vision articulated in our Constitution, those first three words of our Constitution, ``We the People.''  It is this vision of a nation founded on the principle of a government that would serve not the privileged, not the powerful, not the few, not the elite, but serve the entire set of citizenry. Those powerful words were put in supersized font in our So from across the room, you might not be able to read the details, but you can read the mission: ``We the People''--a government of, by, and for the people, as President Lincoln so eloquently said.  But this vision in the Constitution followed up on the principles articulated in the Declaration of In 1776, 56 of our Nation's best minds, our best leaders, gathered together in Philadelphia to debate, to work out a document unlike any other in history--a document that changed the course of world history--the Declaration of It said: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.''  Together, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution laid out the vision for our grand experiment in democracy, our grand experiment in establishing a democratic republic--a nation, of, by, and for the people, where each and every person is equal, each and every person has the ability to pursue their happiness, to pursue opportunity. We may not have always succeeded, but for centuries, the story of our Nation--the American story--has been one of striving to live up to that promise of a more perfect union, where every citizen is equal, every citizen has opportunity, and every citizen can pursue happiness.  Martin Luther King said in the midst of the civil rights struggle:       Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. . . .      Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice,      suffering, struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate      concern of dedicated individuals.  And it is with that type of tireless exertion and passionate concern that we have been on this path toward equality and opportunity for all.  We have made a lot of strides. We have broken down a lot of barriers in overcoming discrimination and in advancing opportunity for one group of Americans after another. For women, for African Americans, for indigenous peoples, for immigrants, for Americans with disabilities, the journey goes on and on. But regardless of how far we have come, it is clear we still have a long way to go.  There are still too many of our friends, too many of our neighbors, too many of our coworkers, our brothers and sisters who don't enjoy the same rights and protections as everyone else. They are members of the LGBTQ community, and they continue to go through every single day confronting discrimination simply because of who they are or whom they love. That is simply not right. There should be no room for that kind of hate, for that kind of discrimination here in the United States of  That is why this week I have reintroduced the Equality I have reintroduced it with powerful support from Senator Tammy Baldwin and Senator Cory Booker, who have really been the leaders who have driven this forward here in the We have been joined now by 43 additional colleagues, so that is 46 Senators, original cosponsors, in support of this vision of equality. That is a powerful stride from where we were just a few years ago, when we didn't even have an Equality Act to be presented here in the halls of  We launched this act in partnership with the House, where Congressman David Cicilline has been the leader, and he has been joined by 194 of his colleagues as original cosponsors.  John Lewis said during the civil rights struggle: ``If not us, then who? If not now, when?'' All of us should be called to action in this fight for the fundamental principle of equality, for us to stand up together and declare once and for all that discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity is not welcome in this country. We must make nondiscrimination the law of the land here in the United States of  It is certainly true that we have made some progress in recent years. We passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded the definition of a Federal hate crime to include assaults based on sexual identity or gender orientation. We repealed don't ask, don't tell, a policy that banned LGBTQ soldiers from serving openly in our military for 17 years and that forced more than 13,000 servicemembers out of the military with dishonorable discharges.  What we did was undermine the effectiveness of our military by taking away the enormous talents and skills of those individuals. And 6 years after repealing that policy, our military is stronger for it.  In the Affordable Care Act, we make sure that no one can be denied healthcare because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Then, in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, was unconstitutional, it was discriminatory, it was in fundamental violation of the vision of our  Then, in 2015, the Supreme Court found, in Obergefell v. Hodges, that love is love, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, and required all States to recognize same-sex marriages and issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  One barrier after another--one barrier after another of discrimination, one barrier after another that presented an obstruction to opportunity has fallen in a relatively short period of time, and that is something all of us should celebrate in the vision of equality and opportunity embedded in the vision of our But we cannot allow ourselves to lose sight of the fact that as much as these have been steps forward, we are still far from ending discrimination to the LGBTQ community here in  Today, every State is required to recognize same-sex marriages and issue wedding licenses to same-sex couples. But 30 of those States still do not have a legal framework that ends discrimination. In 30 of those States, the legal framework of the State does not prevent someone from being fired from their job for being gay or lesbian or transitioning; those States do not have a structure which prohibits a same-sex couple to be refused services, to be evicted from an apartment, to be banned from a restaurant, to be denied opportunities to serve on a jury, to be turned away at the door in pursuit of a mortgage.  We hear these stories from individuals. Ask the science teacher who was fired after telling her principal that she and her wife were planning to get[[Page S2745]]pregnant or the same-sex couple that was forced to leave a park after kissing in public or how about the woman who was fired from her job as a security guard in a Savannah hospital, and when she took the hospital to court, she lost under the framework of law in that  Or ask the LGBTQ community in What we see is that when we have discriminatory laws, a discriminatory legal structure, that engenders discrimination, and the discrimination facilitates and engenders hate, and hate leads to violence. So we saw in Orlando when last summer a crazed gunman attacked those who were at the Pulse Nightclub and took the lives of 49 innocent people.  The States that have no framework are many. They cross our country--Idaho and Montana and Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma, Arizona, Alaska and Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida--no legal structure to end this sort of discrimination.  At some point in their lives, approximately two-thirds of all LGBTQ Americans face discrimination because of their sexuality or gender identification. Roughly a quarter of lesbian and gay and bisexual working Americans have lost a promotion because of nothing more than who they are or whom they love. And nearly--in fact, more than a quarter of transgender, working Americans report that in just a single year, they have been fired or not hired or denied advancement.  There is no Federal framework to end discrimination. Today, only 20 States and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, in housing, in public accommodations. Another three States have a partial set of protections. But instead of seeing the remaining States that still have a framework that provides for discrimination, we have seen more and more discriminatory legislation--laws like North Carolina's HB2, the so-called bathroom bill, which said that transgender individuals had to use a bathroom that matches their birth certificate and which blocked local jurisdictions from passing antidiscrimination measures to protect LGBTQ citizens; or Senate bill 149 out of South Dakota, signed into law in March, saying that LGBTQ people who want to adopt or foster children can be rejected by State-funded agencies based on the religious beliefs of the agency.  Already this year, there have been more than 100 discriminatory pieces of draft legislation offered in State legislatures across our country.  As long as people in our Nation are afraid to put their spouse's photo on their desk at work, as long as citizens are worried about being evicted from their apartment, as long as Americans can be denied service at a restaurant or a hotel room or kicked out of a public park or denied the right to use a bathroom just for being who they are or for whom they love, we need to keep fighting. We need to keep pushing to end discrimination.  Imagine, if you will, when you open a business in America, the principle, since the 1964 Civil Rights Act, has been that you open the door to all. You don't let in a person with one color of skin and slam the door on the next who has darker skin. You don't let in one gender and slam the door on the other gender. You don't let in one ethnicity and slam the door on the other ethnicity.  These fundamental provisions of equality, where the door is open to each citizen by those who provide services to the public--that is the foundation for each individual to be able to live their life fully, to be able to fully pursue their potential, to fully pursue their opportunity, to fully pursue happiness as envisioned in the Declaration of  A former Senator of this body, who served here when I was an intern in 1974, who served here in 2009 when I came to the U.Senate, Ted Kennedy said: ``The promise of America will never be fulfilled as long as justice is denied to even one among us.'' Yet justice is denied every day--every day--in 30 States across our Nation where the door of discrimination is slammed shut on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals.  We the people in America understand that it is time to stop slamming the door of discrimination shut and open the door to full opportunity and full equality as envisioned in our founding documents. Sixty percent of Americans support same-sex marriages. More than half oppose North Carolina's bathroom bill and other similar bills that discriminate against transgender individuals.  According to one study by the Public Religion Research Institute, more than 70 percent of Americans support comprehensive Federal legislation. Public opinion is in support of moving forward--moving forward to keep the door of opportunity open and to stop slamming the door of discrimination in the face of our citizens. It is time for us to stand up for our fellow citizens, time for us to speak out against this discrimination, time for us to declare once and for all that every American, no matter who they are or whom they love, deserves to live free from fear, free from violence, and free from discrimination. It is time for us to stand with our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers, and our brothers and sisters in the LGBTQ community. It is time for us to move forward and create nondiscrimination legislation based on the same sound foundation that has served so well in regards to addressing discrimination in other parts of our society, and that is the 1964 Civil Rights It is time to consider the Equality Act in the Senate of the United  At a time when so much discrimination, so many daily assaults occur on our fellow citizens, shouldn't we be holding a hearing to have these citizens speak up and share their stories? Shouldn't we be holding a vote to determine whether or not we truly believe in our constitutional vision? Shouldn't we have to confront the fact that we still have discrimination in housing, in employment, in schools, in restaurants, and in theaters? In fact, in every walk of life in America, in 30 States, we still have this discrimination without a legal framework in those States to provide protection.  Under the Equality Act, sexual orientation and gender identity receive the same clear level of protection that race, religion, gender, and ethnicity already enjoy, thanks to the 1964 Civil Rights The Equality Act will help us fulfill the promise of America, as Ted Kennedy presented it, that justice under the law is not complete when it is denied to even one among us.  I am a steadfast believer in our Nation's founding principle that all of us were created equal, that we are ``endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'' But you don't have liberty if the door of discrimination is slammed in your face when you seek an apartment. You don't have liberty when the ugly face of discrimination blocks you from an opportunity to serve in a job. You don't have pursuit of happiness when you face a discriminatory framework in 30 of our 50  We all ought to have the same freedom to be who we are, to love whom we love, to pursue our lives and careers free of discrimination. I will not rest until that is true for everyone in our country. I say to my colleagues: Let us all not rest until we complete this vision of opportunity and equality for all.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1290,topic-id,1593,"Mr.President, climate disruption is a significant concern for the health of our planet. It is affecting everything from our agriculture to our economy, to our forests, to our world's glaciers, to our ice sheets, and, certainly, to the distribution of the world's insects and the diseases they carry.  President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has attracted additional attention to the role that America should play in taking on this major challenge. How significant are the impacts of climate disruption to our forests and our farming and our fishing? What are the business opportunities of transforming an economy from that based on fossil fuels to that based on clean and renewable energy? What are other nations doing? How fast do we need to move to save the planet?  There will be many scholarly speeches on these topics here on the floor--many who will have been informed by the experiences that Senators will have had in their home States, both in the evolution of wind and solar energy and the changes that they are seeing in their forests and their farming and their fishing. I hope to draw attention and, hopefully, insights as to these issues in a more lighthearted fashion by presenting periodic episodes of a Senate Climate Disruption Today, I am presenting episode 1 of this Disruption Quiz series. Let's get started.  Question 1: Which famous CEO resigned from three Presidential councils after President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement? Was it Bob Iger of Disney? Was it Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX? Was it Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber? Consider which of these individuals made this decision.  The right answer is Elon Congratulations if that is what you guessed.  Bob Iger of Disney resigned from a Presidential council, but he resigned only from one, not three. He resigned from the Presidential Strategic and Policy Forum, and he has been quite significant in putting forward other environmental issues, such as the zero waste of Disney's theme parks.  He said when he resigned:       Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are      critical to our future, and they aren't mutually exclusive.  He continued:       I deeply disagree with the decision to withdraw from the      Paris  Travis Kalanick, the controversial and besieged Uber CEO, also resigned from the same council, that being the Presidential Strategic and Policy Forum, but he did so in response to the President's Muslim ban, not to the announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris  That takes us to Elon Musk, who resigned from three councils--the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, Manufacturing Initiative, and Executive Council on  He tweeted:       Am departing Presidential councils. Climate change is real.      Leaving Paris is not good for America or for the world.  So that is the first question. Now get ready to see if you can answer the second question correctly.  Question 2: As of today, which two countries are not party to the Paris Agreement? Is it Syria and Nicaragua? Is it Iran and North Korea, two members of the axis of evil? Is it Togo and Indonesia, or is it India and Cambodia? I am sure you have heard climate news about all of these countries, but you may not know which ones are the only two countries in the world that are not members of the Paris  By the way, the United States is not on this list because even though we have announced we are withdrawing, that takes some time, and we are actually still a member.  The correct answer is Syria and  Nicaragua hasn't signed on because they don't believe the Paris Agreement goes far enough in its fight against climate disruption. Today, more than half of Nicaragua's electricity comes from renewable resources--wind, solar, wave, and geothermal. The Government of Nicaragua predicts that within a few years, the percentage of electricity from renewables will rise to 80 percent. Because of the abundance of these resources, a 2013 World Bank report labeled Nicaragua ``a renewable energy paradise.''  The reason Syria didn't participate or sign on to the Paris Agreement is because it is in the midst of a horrific 6-year-long civil war that has claimed the lives of 300,000 men, women, and children and driven millions out of the country.  Now we will turn to question 3. Thanks in part to warmer temperatures and milder winters, cases of which tick-borne illness have more than doubled since 1991? Is the answer Colorado tick fever or tularemia or Lyme disease or Heartland virus?  By the way, all of these are real diseases. Well, Colorado tick fever is a viral infection that is mostly found in the mountain areas of the Western United States and Canada and is transmitted by the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick. Tularemia, which is also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever or O'Hara's fever, is certainly a scary-sounding disease. Lyme disease is mostly transmitted by deer tick bites and is predominantly found in the Northeast and upper Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic regions of the country. And then there is the Heartland virus, which is transmitted by the lone star tick.  Well, the correct answer is--drum roll--C, Lyme disease.  Since 1991, the number of cases of Lyme disease in the United States has doubled. Approximately 30,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, but because it is very difficult to diagnosis, the Centers for Disease Control thinks the real number of cases is about 10 times that, or 300,000 people per year here in the United The main reason for the increase we have seen in Lyme disease is warmer temperatures and milder winters. Cold winters kill ticks; warm winters don't. That is what it boils down to.  On to question 4. Who was recently quoted as saying that ``the fuel of choice right now, certainly for us, is wind''? Was it Bono, the lead singer of U2 and founder of the One Campaign, known for its activist work in Africa? Was it Gwyneth Paltrow, the award-winning actress? Was it Ben Fowke, the CEO of Xcel Energy, which owns and operates 13 coal plants around the country? Was it Pope Francis, who gave our President a copy of his encyclical when the President visited with him just a few weeks ago?  Well, it turns out the answer is C, the CEO of Xcel That is a little bit surprising given that they operate more than a dozen coal plants, but it is also a company that generates one-fifth of its electricity from wind.  In January, the company shut down a large natural gas plant in Colorado for 2 days, and wind, on average, provided the power for half of its customer demand. Wind is Xcel's fuel of choice because once the turbines are built, the cost of the fuel to operate the turbines is zero. The fuel, plainly speaking, is free. And that is what led him to this comment saying that it is a preferred choice. Anytime you can get free fuel, it beats gearing up your coal plant or your natural gas plant.  Now we will turn to question 5, our final question. The Power Minister of which country recently announced that they intend to sell only electric cars by the year 2030? Is the answer India, which is home to 1.3 billion citizens, the world's third largest oil importer and a country with 300 million individuals who don't yet have access to electricity? Is it Germany, a manufacturing powerhouse, which has had a large feed-in tariff--a subsidy, if you will--to encourage distributed solar, solar panels on the tops of commercial buildings and homes? Is it China, where the use of cars has absolutely exploded. And the pollution in Beijing is among the worst pollution in the world, driven largely by the combustion of fossil fuels. Is it Canada, which has a new Prime Minister, Prime Minister Trudeau, who has prioritized tackling climate disruption?  If you guessed Germany, you are almost right but not quite. Germany's[[Page S3393]]Bundesrat, the country's upper legislative chamber, passed a nonbinding resolution last October calling for a phaseout of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030. But that is not quite the question that was asked. The question is, Which country's Power Minister said they would only sell electric cars by the year 2030? And the answer to that is  Speaking at this year's annual conference of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said:       We are going to introduce electric vehicles in a very big      way. We are going to make electric vehicles self-sufficient.      The idea is that by 2030, not a single petrol or diesel car      should be sold in the country.  India, by the way, is already on track to be the world's third largest solar market, with the country's solar capacity expected to reach 18.7 gigawatts by the year's end. The country is also adding 50 percent more solar and wind generation than currently installed here in the United They are replacing 770 million street and household lights with energy-saving and long-lasting LEDs, and they are bringing access to electricity to thousands of poor rural villages through the provision of solar. And they are doing all this faster than anyone could have anticipated.  So that is the full five questions for this week's Senate Climate Disruption Climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. We need to start taking strong, decisive action now to avoid reaching the point where the damage we are doing to our planet becomes irreversible.

1179,topic-id,4595,"Madam President, I have come to the floor this afternoon[[Page S2755]]to speak on the Omnibus appropriations bill that is now before the We will have an opportunity to vote on that very shortly here.  I would like to take a few moments to explain why I intend to support this legislative measure. I support this bill because I think it is good for the country, and I believe it is good for my State of  I think what we have seen through this appropriations process is a negotiated bill going back and forth between both sides, between both bodies, and it is a bill that funds the Federal Government through the end of this fiscal year. It is far from perfect. I think we recognize that, but it is tough to find legislation anyplace where we are all going to be in agreement that it has everything each of us wants. I do believe it is a solid bill. It is a solid, bipartisan effort, and I would urge my colleagues to support this bill.  The first thing it does is it prevents the government from shutting down. Simply put, there are very few things in my mind that would warrant a government shutdown. The people of this country expect us to govern. They don't expect us to come to work and say we are going to shut it down. They expect us to figure out how we are going to fund it, to keep it open, and to do so in a responsible way that allows for the priorities to be reflected. I think we have done that.  I feel very strongly that those who would suggest that the way to deal with things is to shut it down is not the proper approach. That is why I have supported Senator Portman's legislation to put an end to government shutdowns. We just don't need disruptions that ultimately hurt our economy and hurt our families.  I certainly would have preferred a process that would allow for funding the government by passing appropriations measures on an individual basis, one by one. My colleague from Vermont, who is on the floor, has been around for a few Congresses, and he knows that used to be the way we handled appropriations. We had an approps bill come to the floor. We debated it. We amended it. We moved it through. We worked through that process. It was somewhat tediously slow at times, but it was a very open and collaborative process that I think reflected, again, the priorities around the country.  What we have in front of us is a measure that did in fact go through the full appropriations process, all 12 appropriations bills. It made it through the committee. Sometimes not all of them do, but for fiscal year 2017, these appropriations bills did.  As we saw at the end of last year, there was an agreement that we would not move forward with the appropriations bills at that time--actually, it was probably less than an agreement, but a decision was made--and we are here, as of May 4, still working on fiscal year 17.  This is clearly not the best option, in my view, in terms of how we handle our appropriations bills, but it is where we are right now, and the option we have in front of us, in my view, is clearly the best option.  Continuing resolutions are just not a way to operate. I think they are poor policy. Keeping funding at previous levels doesn't allow for Congress to have any input on any new priorities. In some cases, programs receive more money than they may actually need at that time; thus, you have a situation where you are ending up wasting dollars, rather than being good and efficient stewards of the taxpayer dollars.  I think we saw that with this omnibus bill we have in front of us now, it gave our new President the opportunity to weigh in. Clearly, we heard President Trump's priorities expressed not only throughout the campaign but early in his new administration, his priorities on national security, making sure that from a defense perspective and border security, these issues were addressed. I think we have done so in a responsible way on the defense spending side but also with a comprehensive approach to border security and utilizing new surveillance and new technologies.  This bill consolidates or terminates dozens of existing programs and rejects unnecessary spending tax dollars. It reduces spending and wasteful programs, eliminates unnecessary, ineffective, and duplicative programs.  Again, I think what we have put together within this appropriations omnibus is a spending proposal that does apply the taxpayer dollars responsibly. Overall, the bill puts real dollars behind our Nation's priorities by enhancing our national security, investing in education infrastructure and innovation, as well as improving the health and well-being of all  I would like to take just a few moments to speak specifically to some of the provisions that will be helpful in my State of The omnibus bill sustains Alaska's contributions to our national defense, helps to protect our fisheries, address high energy costs, helps our very struggling timber industry in Southeastern Alaska, and helps keep the Federal Government's commitment to Alaska  There are some programs that would appear to be pretty small, but in terms of consequence and impact on Alaska, they are quite significant.  Essential Air Service, we provide funding in this measure that helps maintain commercial air service to as many as 60 small communities in the The reason it is called Essential Air Service is because in most of these communities, there is no other way to get to these smaller communities. There is no road access. There is no other way. You might be able to run a riverboat out, but in terms of ability to access, this Essential Air Service is exactly that.  The bill provides for new investments in the Coast Guard that will help increase safety in Alaska's waters. There are infrastructure improvements in Kodiak to support homeporting Offshore Patrol Cutters in the Arctic region and funding for new cutters that we will see stationed throughout  There is a lot going on in the news right now with regard to Russia and North Korea, and it certainly is front and foremost for We have our neighbors to the west of us there, in Russia, and of course we are within range of anything North Korea might consider. So there is a very keen interest and a desire to ensure that our Nation is investing in our Pacific and our Arctic defense.  This bill recognizes the issue, and it recognizes the strategic value that Alaska has. It provides $4.3 billion for the procurement of F-35s, including some of those that will be based in the interior part of the We saw the need for the next generation of fighter jets in Alaska when, just a few weeks ago, Russian planes were buzzing the coast for 4 days straight. Well, today's news reups that. F-22s intercepted two Russian Bear bombers 50 miles southwest of Alaska, according to the news this morning.  Again, when you are thinking about the investments we make to provide for our Nation's security, Alaska sits at the center up there in terms of strategic location.  There is also money for developing the long-range discrimination radar at Clear and funds for the ground-based missile defense at Fort Again, this is very significant at this time, given the geopolitics not too far from our  Another key part of our Arctic defense strategy is finally being realized, after years of me kind of pounding on this drum--funding for icebreakers. As of right now, we are woefully behind when it comes to our ability to maneuver in the Arctic regions in our waters. So there is $150 million in advance procurement funding for an icebreaker that is in the DOD budget and an additional $55 million in the Coast Guard budget. It is imperative that we move to fund a new icebreaker now.  We also recognize the role the Coast Guard plays in terms of national defense across the country, particularly in the So the bill provides $1.3 billion in acquisition construction and improvement money. The Coast Guard needs to recapitalize its aging fleet, and we see this no more apparent than in A ship that was built back in 1971 is still being used to patrol areas that are perhaps some of the roughest seas in the world. This is not smooth water sailing. Congress needs to recognize the role played by the Coast Guard, not only in national defense but in drug interdiction, fisheries patrol, and safety encroachment, and we must give it the assets it needs to do its job well.  On the education front, this bill provides funds for our public schools, including money for programs that were authorized in It funds IDEA,[[Page S2756]]Carl Perkins, impact aid, and 21st Century Community Learning Especially important for us in Alaska are the programs like ANEEP, Alaska Native Education Equity Program, strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges and universities, and Indian education national activities.  We have all come to the floor over the course of these past few months this Congress to talk about the impact on our communities of the opioid epidemic in this country. This bill helps to get money where it is needed to help fight this epidemic.  Over $1 billion is provided to various programs and agencies to specifically address this problem. Over $600 million of that will go to SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, including $500 million for a new program that was created by the 21st Century Cures Act that we passed earlier last year. The CDC, the Department of Justice, and the VA will see increased funding to help deal with this scourge of addiction.  As chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Approps Subcommittee, the division G of the omnibus is of particular significance to me. The Interior appropriations section probably has more impact on the State of Alaska than most would realize. It controls funding levels for the Federal agencies and Departments that have a huge presence in my State: BLM, Forest Service, EPA, Fish and Wildlife Service, Indian Health Service, BIA, and National Park These are all within the auspices of  I will give you some of the highlights within the Interior bill. This is the centennial year of the National Park Service so we were able to do more to help address the maintenance backlog within our park system.  The two agencies that deliver services for Indian communities, BIA and Indian Health Service, we did our best to support those programs which are critical to the Indian community. For those agencies, we have provided full contract support costs. We continue Tribal court funding for those Public Law 280 We have really worked to do what we can within IHS to address the issues of suicide, domestic violence, alcohol, and substance abuse programs. Making sure we are doing right by providing the support for our healthcare facilities is critically important.  We also have oversight of the EPA within our jurisdiction. I have heard some criticism from some that we didn't do enough to reduce EPA spending and then others are saying we took too much from the EPA, but what we really looked to try to do was to take a commonsense approach, focus resources on the programs that do the concrete things to improve the quality of the environment for the public when it comes to clean air and clean water. We need to effectively make sure that whether it is the WIFIA program, the State revolving funds for our water and our waste water programs, making sure we have the resources to do right by our communities, and making sure there is clean air and clean water, whether it is the Targeted Air Shed Grant Program, which helps communities deal with pollution issues and air issues--I think we did a fair job with the EPA budget.  Again, we have worked to reduce in areas where we are just staffing up for initiatives that quite honestly have been questioned and challenged, making sure we are focusing on the priorities that deliver on EPA's mission, which is clean air and clean water.  Madam President, the last thing I would like to add is what we were able to do with regard to wildfires because this is an issue for so many of us in the We were able to include funding for wildland fire management programs to fully fund the 10-year average of suppression costs, as well as to allow for emergency funding in the event that we have a catastrophic wildfire season. I think we all understand the challenges our agencies face when we have fire borrowing going back and forth. So this is an effort we have long sought to address, and we will continue to work on that.  It has been interesting to watch and to read the news about this omnibus. You have the President who said: This is good. This is what winning looks like. You have Democrats who have said: We won.  It is not about a win for the D's or a win for the R's; it is about making sure this is right for the country. I would suggest that if both sides are taking credit, we must have hit the sweet spot somewhere in the middle.  I think at this place where we are right now, with over 7 months into this fiscal year, it is well past time that Congress pass a bill that funds the government for the balance of this fiscal year. These are uncertain times for the country--uncertain times certainly in my State--and I think it deserves some certainty from us. It is a good bill, and I think we owe it to the American people not to create unnecessary and unwanted drama about whether the Federal Government remains open for business.  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, I come to the floor once again to discuss the threats facing our country, the challenges confronting the brave men and women of our Armed I feel compelled to remind my colleagues about what is at stake because of our failure right here to provide them the resources and equipment they need and deserve, placing their lives at greater risk. That is not my opinion; it is the opinion of the uniformed leaders of our country who have stated time after time that because of our sequestration and our mindless meat ax, we are putting the lives of the men and women who are serving our Nation in uniform at greater risk.  Don't we have an obligation to try to stop that? Obviously, there is not a majority here in the Senate who believes we should, to our everlasting shame. Unless we change course, we will only continue that failure.  We are about to vote on yet another Omnibus appropriations bill. It is well over 1,000 pages. Look here; this is what we are about to vote on without a single amendment--without a single amendment. Is there any Member of the U.Senate who has read this? Is there any Member who has read this bill of over $1 trillion that we are about to vote on? Many of us are going to be compelled to vote for it because we don't want to shut down the government again. The American people don't want the government to shut down, no matter what some colleagues of mine say. But here it is.  I challenge any of my colleagues to come to the floor and tell me they have read this bill.  Is it any wonder that the American people are fed up with this way of doing business? There are 1,000 pages--1,000 pages. That is what we are going to vote on in a relatively short period of time--haven't read it--no amendments.  I am sure there may be some provisions in this 1,000-page document that Members would like to modify, like to add to. But what business are we doing? What is the world's greatest deliberative body doing here in a couple hours? We are going to vote yes or no on a 1,000-page document. Shame on us. Shame on us.  Not a single appropriations bill--we have an Appropriations They have their subcommittees. My friend and colleague from Vermont is here and wants to talk about it. They churn out individual bills. I believe there are 13 of them, one of them being Defense, by the way. But all of that is without amendment, without debate on the floor of the world's greatest deliberative body. Yet we are going to go ahead and vote yes or no.  Many of us are going to vote yes because we don't want to shut down the U.We don't want to deprive our citizens of the goods, services, and provisions that a government is supposed to provide people. I don't want to shut down the Grand Canyon again, my friends. I don't want to deprive people from all over the world the ability to see the Grand So what do we do?  I am all in favor of repealing regulations that are onerous and bad for America and small businesses and large. Is that a rationale for what we are about to do?  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: You blocked many of these bills that we wanted to bring to the[[Page S2757]]floor. You blocked them. Why? For what purpose? Of course, on this side of the aisle, we have agreed to do something like that.  So I just say to my colleagues: You should not be curious when you see the approval ratings of the Congress of the United States in the teens.  Again, as I said, we will be blamed for putting our men and women in uniform at greater risk. That is not John McCain's view; that happens to be the opinion of our uniformed service Chiefs who are telling us that when we are not funding the military, we are putting the lives of the men and women serving at risk.  We passed the Budget Control Act 6 years ago as an attempt to address our spending problem. This legislation led to a $443 billion cut to defense. What has also happened? Deficits came down for a while, and we are on track to return to $1 trillion deficits again in a matter of years. The national debt is set at $20 trillion and has grown and will continue to grow.  We slashed our military, friends. We slashed it. Yeah, great job, we slashed the spending on the military. In fact, if you look, you will see the only portion where there has been a reduction in spending is where?  When you look at the past several years since sequestration, do you think the world has gotten safer? Do you think the men and women who are serving are better protected, better equipped?  We have 60 percent of our F-18s not flying. Why? No parts. We have two submarines tied up at the pier for a year because they cannot leave the pier. The Air Force is 1,000 pilots short.  What have we done? We have cut defense spending by 4 percent. Meanwhile, the interest on the debt has increased by 7 percent; nondefense, 19 percent; and the elephant in the room, the third rail that none of us want to touch is mandatory spending; that is Social Security and Medicare, primarily.  What have we done? We have shortchanged the men and women who are serving in the military, trying to defend this Nation while nondefense spending has gone up by 19 percent.  So the next time I hear one of my colleagues say: Well, we should continue to cut defense spending because of the debt, we have already done that. We have already shortchanged the men and women who are defending this  Over the past 10 years, as I mentioned, mandatory spending has grown by 56 percent, and defense has been cut by 4 percent.  The death spiral is occurring. We are in budget cuts with a high operational tempo, and the military is now in a vicious cycle. The death spiral works like this. This is the death spiral, OK? Constant and frequent deployments increase costs. To send our men and women overseas into harm's way increases costs. The more you fly the plane, the more it costs to maintain the plane. The more you deploy a soldier, the more you have to pay him or her to stay in the military.  When budget top lines are determined by politics and not requirements, the Department of Defense has to make tradeoffs. For example, the military may forgo buying military equipment to keep up with wartime costs, but this exacerbates the problem. Our equipment gets older as it is used more and the cost of maintaining aging equipment skyrockets. Here is the death spiral, why the state of our military is what it is today.  Three--count them--three of our Army brigades are at the highest level of readiness. Four of 64 Air Force squadrons are ready to fight tonight; that is four out of 64. Less than half of the Marine and Navy planes are ready for combat. The Air Force has a pilot shortfall of 1,500--1,000 of which are fighter pilots. The Navy has a maintenance backlog of 5.3 million days. The ship maintenance backlogs are so bad that some ships are like the submarine USS Boise, which is tied up in port and isn't qualified to dive and recently missed a deployment.  Look at this graphic. These are the aircraft--all of them that are fully mission capable. These are the Army units that are ready to fight tonight. This is the U.Air Force, and these depict the airplanes ready to fight; Marine Corps aircraft, the same way.  So here we are with this situation, and what are we doing? We aren't really addressing the issue because we are going to be faced in the next year or so with the same budget problem of sequestration.  While this is happening, our enemies aren't sitting still. Our adversaries are not waiting for this body to wake up to do its job and act. While we have forced our military to make tradeoffs between supporting immediate operational requirements and future modernization, China, Russia, and other adversaries have been singularly focused on developing military capabilities to target U.forces and take away our unique military advantages.  Our military has multiple missions. Our adversaries have one mission, and that is to undermine U.military superiority. I regret to inform my colleagues that they are succeeding much more than we anticipated.  The fact is, the U.military advantage is eroding. National Security Adviser GEN H.McMaster summed it up best when he testified that the U.Army is outgunned and outranged. The reality is not much different across the military services.  The President understands it. Rebuilding the military has been a major priority for this administration, but we have to face the simple fact that the military buildup proposed by this President is illegal because the Budget Control Act forbids it. Over the next 4 years, the Budget Control Act's caps on defense spending would leave President Trump $216 billion short. Even President Obama's budget was $113 billion above the BCA caps, and that budget barely slowed the deterioration of military readiness and capabilities.  I regret to say, Chairman Thornberry, the distinguished chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and I fare even worse against the We believe that rebuilding our military will require a defense budget of $640 billion in fiscal year 2018. Sustaining that level of funding over the remaining years with the Budget Control Act would require an additional $433 billion.  Give our men and women in uniform a budget that will allow them to rise to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Congress must change the Budget Control Act, and the only way to do that is with a bipartisan budget agreement. As we stand here, there is no serious conversation that I am aware of in this body or anywhere else in Washington about what the agreement would look like or what it would achieve.  The next 4 years can't be like the last 4 years. We must find a way to provide the military with the resources they need and deserve to perform the missions we assign them. We must provide them with the timely authorization of appropriations bills. We must provide them with something they have not had for years--certainty--so they can properly plan and efficiently use taxpayers' dollars to defend the  What are we looking at right now?  We are going to pass this thing. It will pass. Then, in September--how many months is that now? It is about 5 months from now--we are going to be bumping up against the same ceiling and the threat of shutting down the government. Are we going to wait until the beginning of September before we start to address this or not? Is that the kind of fiscal cowardice we are going to perform? We are going to see this movie again and again and again and again unless we repeal the Budget Control Act and start providing for the men and women who are serving this Nation and the challenges we are facing, which any military expert will tell you are the greatest they have been in 70 years. We have to stop this.  We will paper over our failures with continuing resolutions. We will cut piecemeal deals in the midnight hour that fail to fix the serious challenges this country faces. We will accept these outcomes because they are better than yearlong continuing resolutions or shutdowns. We will clear the pitifully low bar of success we have set for ourselves, and all the while, challenges we will have been charged to address will only get worse. We have to break this cycle.  After several years of political gridlock, we know a bipartisan budget deal will be necessary to pass appropriations bills. Let's try a novel idea. Why don't we work on the deal now? Why[[Page S2758]]don't we sit down together, with all of us recognizing the challenges to our national security, and fix this problem instead of kicking the can down the road? My friends, if we do not, I guarantee you we will be doing this same thing again in What is that? We will be looking at another 1,000-page bill--1,000 pages that none of us has read. Oh, I take it back. There may be four or five Senators who know what is in it. Maybe 4, maybe 5, maybe as many as 8 out of 100 will know about it. If we do not stop this, this is exactly the movie we are going to see come September--not acceptable.  Don't we owe the men and women who are serving in uniform in harm's way today--several of whom have just been killed in the last few days--more than what we are giving them? Don't we owe them the best equipment and the best training we can possibly provide them with rather than their being dictated to by a meat-ax called sequestration? Don't we?

The final bill was negotiated by the big four--the two leaders in the Senate and the two leaders in the It was not going to happen this way unless the leaders all agreed, so my profound thanks on behalf of the explorers and the adventurers of the United States--the ``can do'' little agency, NASA, that is now on its way to  On behalf of all of the NASA family, I thank the leaders and especially the Democratic leader. A personal thanks for his very kind comments.  Mr.President, we have approached the NASA bill in a bipartisan way. As a matter of fact, I give great credit to both the chairs and the ranking members on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, as well as on the subcommittee on appropriations in the House that handles NASA appropriations. All of those leaders were absolutely key.  Of course, the same thing is true here in the As the ranking member, I have the privilege of sharing the leadership with our chairman, John Thune, on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation It is that subcommittee's chairman and ranking member, as well as the chairman and ranking member from the subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee, from whom we will hear momentarily--to all of them, I am very grateful.  What it says is that NASA--America's civilian space program--should not be a partisan subject. What it says is that the leaders of NASA should not be partisans. As a matter of fact, they should even be more than bipartisans--they should be nonpartisans. That has been the tradition of NASA's, so like that of the Secretary of One considers that appointment to be a nonpartisan. So, too, we consider the Administrator of NASA to be a nonpartisan. I think, in this interim, with the Acting Administrator of NASA, that they are conducting themselves in a very significant way in keeping all of the advancements that they have done but that are now to be accelerated with this appropriations bill.  I congratulate the whole NASA team. It has been my argument to the Vice President and to the President that in the selection of the next leader of NASA, they need to do it in a nonpartisan way so that we can keep going for this human mission that is going to the planet Mars in the decade of the 2030s.  With the increase in NASA funding, we now stand on the precipice of a new golden age of exploration and discovery. In March of this year, several of us were at the White House when the President signed the NASA authorization bill. What we have worked on for the better part of 2 years keeps NASA on a steady course, with a balanced and ambitious mix of science, technology, and exploration initiatives. Let's not forget that the first ``A'' in ``NASA'' is ``aeronautics.'' It keeps all of that moving forward.  This additional $368 million of funding for NASA gives that little agency the ability to build off of the momentum that is already there. For example, in the White House, the Vice President--and I have commended him both privately and publicly--is bringing about the reestablishment of the National Space I shared with him that all of us look forward to working with him and the Council to develop and carry out the ambitious civil, commercial, and national security space agenda for this country.  The $19.65 billion appropriation for NASA, coupled with the NASA authorization bill that we already passed a month or two ago, demonstrates our firm commitment to one day putting humans on Mars and permanently expanding our civilization out into the cosmos. We will soon have a regular cadence of missions that will be launching into deep space using the Space Launch System--the largest rocket ever, a third more powerful than the Saturn V rocket that took us to the Its spacecraft--the Orion--and other systems will be assembled and launched, and a lot of that is being done at Florida's Space The first rockets and spacecraft that will start the journey are being assembled right now at various sites across the country. Right now, the Space Launch System--the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft that sits on top of it--and the launch infrastructure at Cape Canaveral or, more specifically, the Kennedy Space Center, are all in the most challenging stages of their development.  These complex systems are all very intertwined, and it is vital that we make sure that NASA has the funding flexibility that it needs to address issues as they come up so that they can bring these systems together for the launch in early 2019 of the largest rocket ever.  We have asked NASA to look for new ways to expand commercial space activities in Earth's orbit, and we are providing NASA with the tools and the direction it needs to expand our commercial space activity. We are right on track to begin launching astronauts to the International Space Station on American rockets, commercially made, and that is going to start next year.  People do not realize--they thought the space shuttle was being shut down in 2011. They thought that was the end of the space program. All of this is being developed aside from the robotic missions that there have been with the rovers on Mars and all of the pictures of the cosmos. I mean, it is just unbelievable. Next year we are going to replace the Hubble Space Telescope, which has peered back into the beginning of time. We are going to look back almost to the beginning of time with the James Webb Space  All of this is strengthening a flourishing U.space industry, especially in the areas in which NASA centers are located around the country. What is happening at the Kennedy Space Center is that it is being transformed into a commercial as well as a government spaceport--into a busy civil, military, and commercial spaceport.  This appropriations budget allows us to continue all of this going on at the same time. We are going to put up gee-whiz things like the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, as well as additional Mars rovers. The rovers that are up there show that Mars, at one point, was warm and wet. We are going to find out whether there was life there. If there were, was it developed? If there were, was it civilized? If there were, what happened? These are lingering questions as we peer up into the night sky. The funding included in this budget deal moves us ever closer to answering that burning question: Are we alone in the universe? This budget helps us better understand our own planet by funding NASA's Earth Science Program, as well as funding aeronautics and education programs for our youth.  The investments that we as a country make in our space program pay immediate dividends to our quality of life[[Page S2744]]right here on Of course, the space program creates thousands and thousands of jobs for skilled workers to build machines that help us explore the heavens and jobs for the researchers to understand and interpret what we discover and jobs for the engineers and the entrepreneurs to develop new technologies. These public investments also stimulate complementary investments of private capital and the thousands of jobs that follow from that, and those are companies that will partner with  Again, I thank our colleagues in both the House and the Senate for their continued support of our space program. In this time when we find ourselves far too divided in our politics, the exploration of space continues to be a powerful force that brings us together into our search as we explore the universe.

1093,topic-id,867,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate that kind introduction. It was a remarkable time sitting at the airport right there on the Delaware River and understanding how much we depend on safe, secure travel in those airports around the country.  But to both Marc and Brendan, thank you for the Blue Collar Caucus and bringing to light many of the issues that at times we as a nation might have forgotten, quite frankly, those who work with their hands, those who are getting up each and every morning and going to work, having a job, taking care of their family, and I think focusing on that is so important.  I am myself involved with the Building Trades Caucus, and we are talking about something that is near and dear to everybody's heart, and it is called infrastructure.  In this day and age when people are wondering about what is going on in the country, I want to talk about the ``t'' word. No, it is not Donald Trump; it is a trillion dollars, and that is the number that people have been talking about that we need for infrastructure.  Infrastructure means many things to many different people. If you are in Flint, Michigan, it is about having clean water. The pipes need to be replaced. We have a growing infrastructure that is many years old.  When we think back about one of the major components of infrastructure in this country, during the Eisenhower administration, it was building the interstate system, from north to south, from east to west, connecting coasts, connecting cities, connecting And that is something that has been so important to us. But apparently not important enough to keep and maintain.  I am very familiar with the systems that we have. I went to the other 4-year school; it was called an apprenticeship program, an electrical apprenticeship that I spent 4 years in. After graduating, I worked up and down the Delaware River at refineries, on bridges, and on our infrastructure. We know how important it is.  But in Congress, because of the Blue Collar Caucus and many others, we need to remember that the dignity of a job is so important. We have 211 attorneys here in Congress, but there is only one electrician. There is only one carpenter. There is only one ironworker, and there is only one painter. Diversity comes in many shapes and sizes, and our Founding Fathers understood how important that was. They were farmers, printers, attorneys, doctors, all coming together and bringing those experiences into this very House, this very floor, to remember why we are here.  Anybody who drove on a road to get here today understands what infrastructure means.                              {time}  2015  But somehow we haven't paid attention. We had the American Society of Civil Engineers brief us a few weeks ago to the Building Trades Caucus on the report card that they give each and every year: aviation, a D; bridges, a C-plus; ports, a C-plus; energy, a D; transit, a The overall report card was a  If I had come home with a D on my report card, I know what my parents would have done to us. But somehow having the D on the report card for the very infrastructure here in the United States has been acceptable.  Well, it is not. We are deferring this problem to the next generation when we owe them a responsibility of turning over our world to them in a little bit better shape, not worse shape.  So when we look at that investment in roads, rails, ports, airports, it does something more than just to fix the very problems that we look at each and every day. It is about a job. What better way to put America back to work than fixing our own infrastructure. Nobody does it better than the building trades who have the training programs second to none and does not use one dime of public investment. All funded privately. Fifteen different trades coming together to fix our infrastructure.  In addition to that, they do something that is really special. We all know the figure when it comes to those who put the uniform on to help protect our country is less than 1 percent. We have so many of those men and women who are coming home today, and there is a program that the Building Trades Caucus have put together called Helmets to Taking those who want to come home and start a career, took their helmet off and go right into an apprenticeship program, put the hardhat on. What better way to say to those veterans they are welcome home than to give them a job? But not just a job, a career.  So as we continue to have the discussions day-to-day, the ``t'' word is about trillion dollars. It is about putting back into our country the investment that it is due.  Mr.Speaker, I again want to thank my colleagues for coming here today to make sure that we remember those men and women who don't necessarily put on a suit and tie but have the dignity of going to work each day as blue-collar workers, and we are damn proud of it.

There are also a lot of problems around the process for the GROW It bypassed hearings and markups. In fact, up until this bill was published on the Rules Committee website, only lobbyists and a few Republicans even knew what many of the provisions in this bill were. This kind of backroom dealmaking is one of the reasons the general public holds Congress in such low esteem.  There is an immense amount of opposition to this legislation, including from conservation groups, fishing groups, Native American Tribes, and the State of  Mr.Speaker, I have several letters that I include in the Record in regard to opposition to H.23. One of the letters is signed by groups ranging from the American Bird Conservancy to the Animal Welfare Institute, to the Humane Society and a number of others, discussing how this bill would dramatically weaken protections for salmon, birds, and other fish and wildlife.  Another letter that I include in the Record is from a former colleague of ours, now the attorney general of the State of California, Xavier Becerra, and, finally, a letter from the Governor of California as well.                         Please Oppose H.23                                                    July 11, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned      organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.23      (Valadao, R-CA). This bill would dramatically weaken      protections for salmon, migratory birds, and other fish and      wildlife in California's Bay-Delta watershed and would      threaten thousands of fishing jobs in California and Oregon      that depend on the health of these species. In addition to      gutting critical federal environmental protections in      California, H.23 also preempts a wide range of state      environmental laws and would prevent the State of California      from protecting and managing its own water and wildlife      resources. In addition to these provisions focused on      California, the bill also includes titles that would reduce      public and environmental reviews of new dams and water      infrastructure across the Western states. Both the Obama      Administration and the State of California opposed similar      legislation in recent years, including opposition to H.     3964 (Valadao, R-CA) and H.5781 (Valadao, R-CA) in 2014,      and H.2898 (Valadao, R-CA) in 2015.       California has just emerged from a devastating drought, and      the state is taking proactive steps to protect cities, farms,      and the environment from future dry spells. However, several      provisions in H.23 would undermine California's efforts by      permanently preempting critical state laws that protect      salmon and other native fisheries and the jobs they support.      In addition, this legislation would effectively repeal and      preempt state and federal laws and a binding settlement      agreement that require restoration of the San Joaquin River      and its native salmon runs, instead permanently drying up 60      miles of California's second longest river. H.23 not only      preempts state law as applied to federal water projects in      California, but it also preempts the application of state      laws to the State Water Project and virtually all water      rights holders in California's Bay-Delta watershed. This      extensive preemption of state law in H.23 is contrary to      over a hundred years of Reclamation law and would set a      dangerous precedent for other Western states.       H.23 would also override the Endangered Species Act,      increasing the risk that winter-run Chinook salmon and other      native fish species are driven extinct. Further, H.23      could devastate wildlife refuges that provide habitat for      millions of birds that migrate along the Pacific Flyway by      undermining the refuges' water rights and threatening      critically important funding sources. H.23 would also      eviscerate the 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act,      eliminating instream flows to benefit salmon and funding for      habitat restoration projects, which help to mitigate the      adverse effects of the Central Valley The impacts      from these provisions would reverberate along the entire West      Coast, affecting fishing jobs and related industries in      Oregon and Washington that depend on salmon from California's      Central Valley and threatening populations of waterfowl and      shorebirds that migrate to and from Alaska and Canada each      year.       In addition to these provisions focused on gutting      environmental protections in California, H.23 also      includes several titles that would weaken the public's right      to know and environmental protection across the western      United For instance, the bill's dam permitting      provisions would give the U.Bureau of Reclamation      unprecedented control over the environmental review process      and could undermine the ability of the U.Fish and Wildlife      Service and N.O.A.Fisheries to share expertise and inform      the development of major infrastructure investments. These      provisions would make it difficult, if not impossible, for      responsible agencies to meaningfully analyze proposed      projects and could limit the public's ability to weigh in on      infrastructure that could affect communities for decades.       H.23 has not been the subject of a single committee      hearing to receive public input from the State of California,      hunting organizations, sport and commercial fishermen,      tribes, or conservation groups, even though the bill could      greatly interfere with state water rights and cripple the      ability of state and federal agencies to manage limited water      resources for all beneficial uses. Last year Congress passed      legislation addressing California's water operations in the      Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016      (P.114-322). H.23 would undermine that legislation,      which supporters claim requires that state and federal water      projects are operated in compliance with state law and the      Endangered Species       H.23 also threatens thousands of fishing jobs in      California, Oregon, and beyond that depend on healthy salmon      runs from the Bay-The closure of the salmon fishery in      2008 and 2009 resulted in thousands of lost jobs in these      states. The livelihoods and recreational interests of salmon      fishermen, Delta farmers, fishing guides, tackle shops, bird      watchers, waterfowl hunters, and communities across      California and along the West Coast depend on the      environmental protections that H.23 would eliminate.       For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to oppose H.     23. Thank you for your attention.

Re H.23 (Valadao).     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     House Minority Leader,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear House Speaker Ryan and House Minority Leader Pelosi: I      am writing to express my opposition to H.23, the Gaining      Responsibility on Water Act of 2017. This legislation would      exempt California from the long-standing principle that      Congress should defer to the individual states in the      management of their water resources. While H.23 purports      to affirm state authority to regulate the waters within their      borders as to other western states, the legislation singles      out California by abrogating California water resource law      and effectively federalizing the State's water resource      management to the injury of the State's fish and wildlife      resources.       Like its predecessors H.1873 and H.3964, H.23      would transgress state sovereignty in at least three      important respects. First, the legislation would mandate that      the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California      State Water Project (SWP), the largest water projects in the      State, operate to outdated water quality standards for the      Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta developed over twenty-two years      ago, and would preclude state authorities from altering such      standards notwithstanding the cumulative scientific evidence      that these standards are insufficient to protect the State's      fisheries. Second, the legislation would prohibit the      California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and      the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) from      exercising their state law duties to protect fishery      resources and public trust values, not only as to CVP and SWP      operations, but as to all water right holders in      Third, the legislation would overturn settled principles of      cooperative federalism by materially altering the San Joaquin      River Restoration Settlement Act, an act that implements a      settlement reached by the United States, several      environmental organizations, and local water users resolving      a dispute over application of state fishery law to federal      facilities on the San Joaquin California supported the      compromise settlement and the implementing legislation and is      a partner in the San Joaquin River Restoration       These proposed constraints on California's ability to      manage its natural resources conflict with historic      principles of western[[Page H5447]]     water law. In California v. United States (1978) 438 U.     645, 654, the U.Supreme Court affirmed California's      ability to impose state law terms and conditions on federal      reclamation projects, and declared that, ``[t]he history of      the relationship between the Federal government and the      States in the reclamation of the arid lands of the Western      States is both long and involved, but through it runs the      consistent thread of purposeful and continued deference to      state water law by Congress.''       California law grants the SWRCB the continuing authority to      review and reconsider all water rights for the purpose of      determining whether their exercise would violate the      reasonable use requirement of the Article X, Section 2 of the      California constitution and California's common law doctrine      of the public trust. According to the California Supreme      Court, ``[t]he state has an affirmative duty to take the      public trust into account in the planning and allocation of      water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever      feasible.'' (National Audubon Society v. Superior Court      (1983) 33 Ca1.3d 319, 446.) The California Legislature has      adopted these principles as ``the foundation of state water      management policy.'' (Code, 85023.) H.23 would      abrogate California's ability to apply its water resource      laws while purporting to maintain and protect the ability of      other western states to manage their water resources. H.23      provides no explanation as to why California should be      subject to such disparate treatment as to its sovereign      authority to manage its natural resources.       In addition, H.23 takes these steps in violation of      settled constitutional principles of state sovereignty.      Relying upon separation of powers principles set forth in the      Tenth Amendment and elsewhere in the U.Constitution, the      U.Supreme Court in New York v. United States has held that      ``even where Congress has the authority under the      Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain      acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to      require or prohibit those acts.'' (New York v. United States      (1992) 505 U.144, 166-167.) In Printz v. United States,      the U.Supreme Court expanded its ruling in New York and      held that ``[t]oday we hold that Congress cannot circumvent      that prohibition by conscripting the States' officers      directly.'' (Printz v. United States (1997) 521 U.898,      935.)       By compelling the SWP, a state-funded and managed water      project, to operate based upon congressionally-mandated Delta      water quality standards, rather than allowing California to      develop standards that reflect the most recent scientific      information regarding the Delta, H.23 is ``requiring'' a      state agency to comply with a federal policy. By preventing      the SWRCB, the DFW, and other state agencies from taking      actions to protect fishery and other public trust values,      H.23 is ``prohibiting'' the State from enforcing state      law. These provisions of H.23 violate settled state      sovereignty principles. Congressional passage of H.23      would have, in effect, unconstitutionally ``dragooned'' state      agencies and state officials ``into administering federal      law.'' (Printz, supra, 521 U.at p. 928.)       I urge you to oppose H.23. Congress cannot justify the      legislation's disparate treatment of California's sovereign      authority to manage its natural resources and cannot compel      California to act as its regional agent to enforce      congressional policy. I ask that you affirm the long-standing      congressional tradition of cooperative federalism and dual      sovereignty in water and reject H.23's attempt to      federalize water resource management in the           Sincerely,                                                   Xavier Becerra,     Attorney                                  ____                                       Office of the Governor,                                                    July 10, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: I write to oppose H.23, the ``Gaining      Responsibility on Water Act of 2017.''       Water defines the west and for over a century Congress and      the courts have consistently recognized that state law      determines how water is developed and used. Western states      have successfully resisted any attempted intrusion into this      essential attribute of their sovereignty, including in the      operation or construction of water projects involving the      federal government. This bill overrides California water law,      ignoring our state's prerogative to oversee our waters.      Commandeering our laws for purposes defined in Washington is      not right.       It is also not smart. California is the sixth-largest      economy in the world, and its future depends on the wise and      equitable use of its water. Making decisions requires      listening to and balancing among the needs of California's      nearly 40 million residents and taking into consideration      economics, biodiversity and wildlife resources. All of this      is best done at the state and local level--not in a polarized      political climate 3,000 miles away.       Undermining state law is especially unwise today as      California, with input from all stakeholders, is poised to      make its boldest water infrastructure investments in decades:      funding surface storage, updating an antiquated delta water      conveyance, and adopting water-use efficiency targets.       I ask you to respect California's rights and shelve this      bill.           Sincerely,                                              Edmund Brown,  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5444-4.txt,1910,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,12.0,May
1236,topic-id,1808,"Mr.Speaker, the only winners under this bill are actually a few large agricultural producers who will take all the water, leaving none for many others. This bill is a water grab, plain and simple. The so-called GROW Act provides no new water, but it takes the existing water and gives it to those with the best lobbyists here in  Instead of this highly partisan bill, we should be taking steps to actually grow the water supply for everybody, with water recycling, with water conservation, water efficiency, many other nonideological, nonpartisan fixes, water infrastructure that can actually help deliver water to small farmers, protect our environment, and, yes, our legitimate agricultural producers as well.  Unfortunately, instead, we are stuck with this so-called GROW Act, which jeopardizes fishing jobs, preempts State conservation laws, overrides the Endangered Species Act for salmon and wildlife, weakens critical safeguards under the NEPA process, and undermines water rights. In doing so, this bill would permanently destroy California's rivers, Bay-Delta Estuary, needed fisheries, and the thousands of jobs that depend on those natural resources.  This bill is not a balanced protection. It picks winners and losers and hands over water rights to those who are present for the backroom deals in  Let's go back to the drawing board. I come from the State of Colorado, and we know how important water is. Let's find a way to find a bipartisan path to grow the water supply across the Western United                              {time}  1245  Let me address the other bill that is contained in this rule, the NDAA, National Defense Authorization For 56 straight years, the United States Congress has come together to craft policies and recommendations for the United States Armed Forces and to put those policies into law under the authorizing statute for our military. Without question, this bill is one of the most consequential and important items that Congress undertakes each year.  Personally, I have found objections to policies, and I have been a fan of other policies contained in these bills while I have been in And I want to commend the work of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, who serve on the Armed Services Committee for their important work on this legislation so important for our national security.  Many of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have served or do serve in our military. Members of the committee are dedicated public servants, they are experts in their field, they travel and learn and hear from experts, and they set aside many of their political differences to do what it takes to keep America safe and secure, something that Republicans, Democrats, Independents are all committed to. We need to make sure that we give our military the tools they need to safely carry out the tasks that the Commander in Chief and elected officials ask them to undertake.  I commend the committee for putting forth a bill that takes constructive steps in filling military readiness gaps, requiring strategies from the administration and the Department of Defense with regard to contingencies in several countries, and acknowledging and planning for the real climate change threat that is posed to our national security.  Yet the work of the NDAA is not limited to members of the Armed Services The Members of this body as a whole, Democrats and Republicans who don't serve on that committee, have submitted over 400 amendments to do what each one of us believes would, in some way, improve this bill and strengthen our national security.  But the work of NDAA continues, and before this week is over, I expect to see the Rules Committee make in order an even greater number of these amendments. We took the first step in this rule by making a few dozen amendments in order, and we will continue that work in Rules Committee this afternoon as we thoughtfully go[[Page H5448]]through the 400 amendments so a representative number of those from my Democratic and Republican colleagues who don't have the opportunity to serve on the Armed Services Committee can present those ideas for consideration by the full  But for all the hard work that the Armed Services Committee has done, what we have before us this week is essentially an argument that needs to be solved by the Budget Committee and can't, frankly, be solved by the authorizing committee.  What we are doing is we are having a very strange debate in this body. We are having effectively a budget debate within the defense bill. We are discussing authorization levels, when we know that the real discussion and battle over tradeoffs will be around the funding levels, not so much the authorization levels.  One of the tricks that we worry about is by blatantly disregarding the proper use of the overseas contingency fund and by deliberately flouting limitations set by the Budget Control Act, this Armed Services authorization bill has been completely overtaken by the debate on the Federal budget.  So this week we see a debate about the inability to pass a budget, adhere to a budget, and balance our budget, and, rather, we are operating kind of in this lala world of, if we had all the money in the world, here is what we would do, but as my Democratic and Republican friends know, we live in a world of tradeoffs, and we as Democrats and Republicans will need to decide what those tradeoffs are. That is not being done in this bill, and, in fact, it is one week less that we have to have those important discussions about how to actually secure America and protect our country.  If the debate over armed services wasn't such a serious topic, I would, frankly, give the Republicans kudos for building such an elaborate and complex budget scheme. It is very clever, more so than the traditional overseas contingency gimmicks that have been presented within recent years. It took me a little while to even understand what this budget gimmick was, and I am going to now seek to explain it.  The Defense spending budget is capped at $549 billion by the Budget Control Act of 2011. $549 billion is the maximum that would be spent on defense. This bill authorizes $621 billion as its discretionary base budget authority. That means that the bill we are debating today goes $70 billion in spending above the spending caps that Congress agreed on. That is all deficit spending. That means Congress will increase the deficit by $70 billion under this bill, but it gets worse.  The United States has been embroiled in conflict abroad since 2001, and many administrations, Democratic and Republican, have requested another pot of money that we call the overseas contingency fund. These funds, as the name indicates, are supposed to be used for paying costs that are incurred due to U.engagement in contingency operations, not baseline operations. And they are exempt, rightfully so, from the budget caps, because we never wanted to constrain our ability to provide funding for an unforeseen contingency situation that becomes a necessity for our national security.  This year, however, the bill provides for $74 billion for this overseas contingency fund, a full $10 billion above what was even requested by the  Now, a reminder, the Republicans haven't actually produced a budget this year, so we can't exactly make a comparison between the President's budget and the Republican majority's budget. I think one of the reasons they might be afraid to is they will show substantially increased deficits with these tax-and-spend Republican policies that have come to typify the Republican approach to grow our government with every new spending bill.  What the NDAA does is it takes this overseas contingency account, which is often called the slush fund for the Pentagon, it adds $10 billion to that fund, but instead of paying for future contingencies, that will pay for baseline operations. Some of that $10 billion goes to the unfunded priorities of the Pentagon, things it couldn't quite fit in the $621 billion, which already increases Federal spending by $70 billion.  So it is just throwing money, Federal money, your taxpayer money, Mr.Speaker, hand-over-fist, without a plan, indebting future generations for spending money today. The Pentagon gets more big ticket items they want.  And, likewise, it is hard to argue with funds being allocated to operations and maintenance. We are all for maintenance, we are all for readiness, but we are all for understanding the tradeoffs that we have. We cannot simply continue to spend irresponsibly, indebting future generations.  At some level, Mr.Speaker, and I think this kind of throwing additional money well above and beyond the budget caps reaches that level, we make our Nation less secure rather than more secure by making us economically beholden to foreign nations and indebting future generations of  Congress has set limits on how much we can spend on defense versus nondefense. So when we run out of money under this NDAA plan, either we are going to be forced to spend more, which is what you and I can predict what will happen, of course that is what is going to happen, or they are somehow going to find the money elsewhere, which I can pretty much assure you, Mr.Speaker, is not going to happen. That is a prediction that I am giving you.  And not having seen a budget, by the way, this is, we think, why Republicans haven't come up with a budget, because they know they can't make enough devastating cuts to possibly pay for this military increase, and they certainly don't want to put their name to paper on those cuts. And we all know what is going to happen. They won't make those cuts, spending will go up, debt will go up. I mean, that is what we know will happen. We have been here before, seen that movie.  Now, again, theoretically, Draconian cuts can be made to schools and Head Start and NASA and medical research, money fighting the opioid epidemic, homeland security, police. Yeah, theoretically they can devastate everything inside of our country, leaving a hollowed-out core, a well protected hollowed-out core, but I know Republicans aren't cruel enough to do that. Instead, they are going to kick the can down the road and indebt future generations and make our country less secure by borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia to fund today's military, making us economically beholden to the very foreign powers that represent a real geopolitical threat to American interests.  That is why budgets matter, that is why these budget gimmicks that are being used through the overseas contingency fund matter, and that is why we need to have a budget debate, not a fake budget debate in the context of a national defense debate, which is what is being done here today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5444-4.txt,1910,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,12.0,May

Mr.Speaker, we are here with H.23 again discussing attempts to override State and Federal environmental law. The House and Senate negotiated additional pumping flexibility in last year's WIIN This group has stated for years that they just want a little additional flexibility in environmental law, which actually means weakening or eliminating environmental law. They ignore the damage this would cause to California's delta region, its families, and its farmers.  We heard last year that governments are set up for the benefit of the people, but this means all of the people, not just a few people at the expense of others.  The person nominated to Deputy Secretary at the Department of the Interior worked for Westlands Water District just last He would make decisions to pump more water to Westlands, the Nation's largest water district--a clear conflict of interest, and a clear threat to farmers and residents in the delta.

Mr.Speaker, in April, President Trump and congressional Republicans rolled back the FCC's rule to protect Americans' personal information and their internet browsing history. By doing so, they effectively sold personal privacy to the highest corporate bidder.  Today is Net Neutrality Day of Action, protesting the FCC's proposal to end equal access to online content, which would destroy the internet as we know it. What better day to also protect the future of our privacy by undoing the Republicans' reckless rollback that placed cable profits above our privacy and consumer protections.

1254,topic-id,540,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill has several other policies I want to address. For one, it ties our participation in the critical New START with Russia to a separate Europe-focused treaty that Russia is not in compliance with.  The New START is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between our Nation and Russia, and we should not remove ourselves from that, from an agreement that allows us to inspect and gather information about Russia's nuclear facilities.  In addition, this rule, if adopted, would fail to extend the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance, causing it to expire in May of 2018. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance is a program that was originally created in the NDAA, and goes a long way to helping to mitigate the problems that recipients of the Defense Department's Survivor Benefit Plan face.  There are other provisions of this bill which I object to in their current form but are going to be debated through amendments very likely over the course of the next week. For instance, the bill currently prevents the transfer of any detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. This detention facility that is extralegal should be closed, not repopulated, and we certainly will have that debate this week.  This bill, unfortunately, also authorizes far too many funds and continues to overfund our nuclear weapons activities, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, in fact, as much as $1 trillion over the next 30 years, for a stockpile of weapons that, even if substantially cut, would be enough to end life on the planet.  I testified before the Appropriations Subcommittee with regard to this matter and argued how can we possibly go before the taxpayers back home and say we need to overfund our nuclear arsenal to destroy the world seven times instead of five, or five times instead of three.  One would think that ending life on the planet once would be more than enough, and it is hard to argue from taxpayers that they should, in fact, pay for this planet's destruction multiple times.  We also continue to use force in our ongoing operations in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. I join my colleagues from the other side of the aisle in calling for an updated Authorization for Use of Military To date, Congress has taken zero meaningful actions toward achieving that, yet we hear on this floor regularly from my friend from Alabama and others that Republicans and Democrats need to do that, especially before we put another soldier in harm's way.  That is the role of this body, and it is time to stop avoiding the task of writing an Authorization for Use of Military Have that debate and make it happen.  These are the types of questions we should be debating, but instead we are continuing to avoid those and plunging our Nation deeper into debt without a real budget plan.  Instead of focusing on real questions about how to improve our defense, the general debate on this bill will largely focus on budget tricks. This debate on this budget should happen on the floor, in the Budget Committee, in a budget passed by this body.

1247,topic-id,617,"Mr.Speaker, if today's vote on the previous question fails, instead of voting on a partisan bill that rolls back key environmental laws, overturns State law, and ignores real solutions to our water supply shortages in the West, we will have the opportunity to vote on my bill, H.1868, the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017.  This bipartisan legislation will reverse the President's decision to assign a disastrous resolution allowing internet providers to sell their customers' personal information without their acknowledge or without their consent.  As a former computer programmer and someone who has firsthand experience writing code, I can tell you that the first step towards protecting vulnerable and sensitive data is to make sure it remains private.  S.34, which now, unfortunately, is the law, prevents vital online protections for millions of Americans nationwide from taking effect later this year. The resolution, signed by the President, negating FCC broadband consumer privacy rules is not only wrong and a blatant violation of privacy, but it jeopardizes Americans' personal data and puts them at risk of hacking.  The October 2016 rule was the only rule that required internet service providers to obtain consumers' permission before selling their private internet browsing history and other sensitive information, including geolocation and amp usage.  I am simply shocked that most of my colleagues across the aisle voted for a[[Page H5451]]measure that violates Americans' privacy by selling our most intimate and personal information, all without our consent.  Repealing the FCC rule with S.34 now allows broadband providers to turn private personal information over to the highest bidder--or anybody they want, including the government--without a warrant and without ever telling you.  That is right. Without this rule that President Trump and most Republicans in Congress blocked, internet service providers don't need to ask for permission to collect and share sensitive personal information. Even worse, the passage of this resolution also told providers they no longer have to use reasonable measures to protect consumers' personal data.  This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where identity theft and internet hacking have become the new norm. Shortly after President Trump and Republicans repealed these consumer protections, we experienced a massive ransomware attack that caused major damage to businesses and companies around the world. No American wants their most personal information to be up for grabs.  By using the Congressional Review Act to eliminate this rule, the FCC is now prevented from publishing rules that are substantially the same absent additional legislation, establishing a dangerous precedent for private citizens.  Americans should have the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal information, especially since many people can't choose their own broadband provider.  What my bill does, Mr.Speaker, is simple. H.1868 makes it clear that the American people's browsing histories are not for sale; the American people's personal information is not for sale; the American people's financial information is not for sale; and the American people's location data is not for sale.  It is a very simple concept, one that I hope my colleagues across the aisle will recognize and support. The American people don't want the legislation that was signed into law this last spring. In overwhelming numbers, they are calling Congress and letting it be known they want to keep their private information private.  I am proud to stand up for the American people, and I hope you take up the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017 for consideration. This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will reverse a misguided resolution by saying, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell customers' personal information without their knowledge and without their permission. This bill says that your privacy is not for sale, period.                              {time}  1315  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5444-4.txt,99999999999999,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,12.0,May

From there, he went on to pursue his education and earned a bachelor of arts degree in sacred theology and a master of arts degree in philosophy from Mary of the Lake  Mr.Speaker, after ordination, Father Clements continued his role as a trailblazer when, in June of 1969, he became the first Black priest of Holy Angels Catholic Church, which we in the First District of Illinois are proud to claim.  Mr.Speaker, from that position, Father Clements has had a tremendous impact on lives all across the city of Chicago and all across our great One such incident of tremendous significance to me personally are his actions that he undertook in the aftermath of the assassination of my dear friend and deputy chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party, Fred  On December 4, 1969, Fred Hampton was assassinated. December 4, 1969, is a dark day in the history of the civil rights movement and in the struggle for social justice here in our great Mr.Speaker, that is the day that Fred Hampton, as I said before, was assassinated by members of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, who worked in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau of  Mr.Speaker, it is only by the grace of God that I escaped that same fate. Knowing that I was being pursued as a target of the FBI, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, and the Chicago Police Department, this same extraordinary priest, Father George Clements, offered me protection under the very old ecclesiastical right of sanctuary that has been honored throughout many centuries here and all across the world in a church not[[Page H4174]]only in America, but in Europe, Asia, and  Mr.Speaker, if not for the heroic actions of Father Clements on that day, I would not be standing here in the well of the House on this very day.  Father Clements just didn't stop on that infamous day of December 4, 1969. Throughout the years, countless others have also benefited from Father George Clements' boundless love for humanity. In 1980, he started the Catholic church's first One Church One Child program, an effort to increase the adoption race of African-American orphans. He took this noble, gigantic step so to heart that, in 1981 he himself adopted a child; something that had been unheard of in the history of the Catholic church: a Catholic priest adopting a child.                              {time}  1445  He did not stop there, Father He has taken personal responsibility for and adopted other children. He has been an excellent father to four wonderful children: Joey, Friday, Stewart, and Saint  Father Clements' selfless devotion to humanity did not stop there. After retiring from the Holy Angels Catholic Church in 1994, Father Clements made his way to our Nation's He came here to Washington, D.C., to establish the One Church-One Addict program beginning here in our Nation's  Mr.Speaker, as some of us more seasoned folks in this Chamber may recall, this was a time when our Nation's Capital was known as the ``murder capital'' of This fact did not deter Father Clements from seeking to help those in need, from trying to be a solution to a highly recognized problem. Father Clements' unboundless love was in full effect once again. Even after all of his years of selfless, sacrificial, hard work, Father Clements still had more to give.  In 1999, he established the One Church-One Inmate program, which was a shared effort to help prison inmates and their families by helping inmates transition from incarceration to a life as productive and ``spiritually healed,'' law-abiding citizens.  What a remarkable man Father George Clements was, and what a remarkable man he is this very day.  The Nation, Hollywood has recognized this glorious man. They made a movie after him, called, ``The Father Clements Story,'' where the award-winning actor Lou Gossett starred as Father  In short, Mr.Speaker, Father Clements has been a beacon of light during the dark days of our He has been a community leader, a selfless advocate for the downtrodden, and above all, he has been a true and loyal friend to those who are in need. He is a religious man who walks the walk just as he talks the talk.

1035,topic-id,1269,"Mr.President, in a short time, we will vote on the motion to proceed to debate the House Republican healthcare bill. Several months into this new process, with Republicans in the majority in both Chambers, the American people have not been treated to a high-minded debate or to much debate at all.  The very first action of this Congress was for the majority to pass reconciliation instructions on healthcare--a process which has locked out Democrats from the very beginning. The very first thing this Republican Congress said to the American people is that healthcare is going to be a partisan project, undertaken by Republicans and Republicans alone. Right out of the gate, Democrats were locked out. The majority leader elected to forge a bill in secret and bypass the committee process entirely--no public hearings, no open debate, no opportunity for the minority to amend the bill or even to read it before it emerged from the leader's office. Their plan all along was to keep their bill hidden for as long as possible, evade scrutiny, hide the truth from the American people, and then jam the bill through in the dead of night on a party line.  Now, here we are, after so much cloak-and-dagger legislating, about to vote on proceeding to a debate on one of the most important issues of our time--one-sixth of the economy and tens of millions' health and even lives affected without knowing exactly what we will be debating on. Perhaps nothing could sum up the process that has gotten us here quite as well as this. The best the majority leader has been able to cook up is a vague plan to do whatever it takes to pass something--anything--to get the bill to a House and Senate conference on healthcare.  My colleagues, plain and simple, it is a ruse. The likeliest result of a conference between the House and Senate is the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act or something very close to it. It will, certainly, mean drastic cuts in Medicaid, huge tax cuts for the wealthy, no help for those with preexisting conditions, and tens of millions losing healthcare, particularly in poorer and more rural  The hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House would never accept a Republican bill that only repeals a few regulations in the ACA but leaves much in place.  I would say to my colleagues, particularly those on the other side of the aisle who have heartfeltly fought hard for not cutting Medicaid drastically, for keeping preexisting conditions, for not giving tax cuts to the rich while you are cutting healthcare for the poor, do not go along with this motion to proceed, because you know and I know what it will lead to. All of the things that you have been trying to avoid will emerge from that conference, and you will hurt the people of your States dramatically.  We all know what is happening here. The leader could not get the votes on a full repeal because it is so damaging to He could not get the votes even on his own bill. Instead, the plan is to come up with a proposal that is simply a means to repeal, a means to dramatic cuts, a means to getting us in conference, and we all know what the result of that conference will be.  I would plead one last time with my friends on the other side of the aisle--and I know you have sincerely tried to modify and change things--to turn back. We can go through regular order. We want to work with you. We know that the ACA is not perfect, but we also know that what you have proposed is much worse. We can work together to improve healthcare in this country. Turn back now before it is too late and millions and millions and millions of Americans are hurt so badly in ways from which they will never, ever recover.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, 7 years ago, Democrats imposed ObamaCare on our country. They said that costs would go down. Costs skyrocketed. They said that choice would go up. Choice plummeted. Now ObamaCare's years-long lurch toward total collapse is nearing a seemingly inevitable conclusion, and it will hurt even more Americans on the way down.  This, my friends, is the ObamaCare status quo. This is the status quo. We have had to accept it for a long time. We do not have to accept it any longer.  The American people elected a House with a vision of a better way on healthcare. Then they elected a Then they elected a Now, having been given the responsibility to govern, we have a duty to act. The President is ready with his pen. The House has passed legislation. Today, it is the Senate's turn. That starts with a vote that we will take momentarily. The critical first step in that process is the motion to proceed. It is the vote that determines whether this debate can proceed at all, whether we will even take it up after four straight elections in which this was a huge commitment to the American people. It is the vote that determines whether the Senators of both parties can offer their amendments and ideas on healthcare.  I told the people of my State, over this period, that I would vote to move beyond ObamaCare, and that is what I am going to do today by voting yes. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in doing so. We have already shown that it is possible to put legislation on the President's desk that moves us beyond ObamaCare and its years of failure. We did that 2 years ago. President Obama vetoed what we passed before. President Trump will sign what Congress passes this time.  I thank the President and the administration for all they have done on this issue already. They have worked with us every step of the way, and they, like us, know the consequences of failing to act.  Look, we cannot let this moment slip by. We cannot let it slip by. We have[[Page S4168]]been talking about this for too long. We have wrestled with this issue. We have watched the consequences of the status quo. The people who sent us here expect us to begin this debate, to have the courage to tackle the tough issues. They did not send us here just to do the easy stuff. They expect us to tackle the big problems. Obviously, we cannot get an outcome if we do not start the debate, and that is what the motion to proceed is all about.  Many of us on this side of the aisle have waited for years for this opportunity and thought that it would probably never come. Some of us were a little surprised by the election last year, but with a surprise election comes great opportunities to do things that we thought were never possible. All we have to do today is to have the courage to begin the debate with an open amendment process and let the voting take us where it will.  That is what is before us, colleagues. Will we begin the debate on one of the most important issues confronting America today? It is my hope that the answer will be yes.

1167,topic-id,1986,"Mr.President, yesterday afternoon the House approved the Omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the government through The bill is the result of weeks and weeks of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, and the final product reflects the give-and-take of those negotiations. Again, I want to thank the majority leader for all of his hard work and his desire to come to a good agreement, as well as the House leaders and the leadership of the Appropriations It has proved to many that Washington can work when we work together.  In my view, this is a very good bill for the American people. Not only does it explicitly preclude funding for an unnecessary and ineffective border wall, it excludes over 160 poison pill riders, it increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, such as medical research, education, and infrastructure.  The National Institutes of Health will get an additional $2 billion--part of the Cancer Pell grants will be restored for over 1 million students. Infrastructure programs like CDBG and TIGER will get an increase. Programs to combat the terrible scourge of opioid abuse will receive an increase. Clean energy research will receive an increase. Ninety-nine percent of the EPA's budget was protected.  In addition, there is a permanent extension of miners' health benefits, thanks to the hard work of Joe Manchin and so many others; funding to shore up Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program and a mechanism to allow the island to restructure its debt; and funding to help States like California, West Virginia, Louisiana, and North Carolina recover from natural disasters. It[[Page S2742]]has a very good increase for NASA, which I will talk about at the end of my remarks before my colleague from Florida speaks about the hard and successful work he has done on the NASA budget.  Of course, the bill doesn't include all of the things we wanted. It doesn't include all of the things our Republican colleagues wanted. That is the nature of compromise. But at the end of the day, this is an agreement which reflects our basic principles, and it is something both Democrats and Republicans should support.  The bill shows how bipartisanship in Congress should work--both parties negotiating in good faith in order to find consensus. It passed in the House with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 309 votes, and I expect it will receive the Senate's approval later today.  More broadly, I hope this deal provides a blueprint for future budget negotiations between our two parties here in If the four corners--the Senate and House Democrats and Republicans--work as well on the 2018 budget as we did on the 2017 budget, we will have a product we can be proud of, with no worries about any kind of government shutdown.                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, on healthcare, as the House plans to vote on their new vision and version of TrumpCare later today, I just want to remind the American people of a few things.  We are now on the second major attempt to pass While all the focus in the media has been on the changes to the bill, we shouldn't forget the bad things that stay in the underlying bill and what they would mean for millions of  Under the new bill, as under the old, TrumpCare would mean that premiums go up 20 percent in the first few years. Average costs go up by over $1,500 a year on the middle class.  It would mean that if you are struggling to make it into the middle class with an income, say, around $30,000 a year, your costs could go up by $3 or $4,000.  It would mean insurers could charge older Americans five times or more the amount charged to younger folks. Even the 1-to-5 ratio, as bad as it was, as much as it raised the hackles of the members of the AARP and senior citizens, the 54- through 64-year-olds throughout America--this bill makes that worse.  It would devastate Medicaid, a program that covers 68 million That would affect poor people in the inner cities, but it would also affect people in nursing homes, and the young men and women aged 45 to 50 who have parents in nursing homes are going to have to face an awful choice--more money out of their pockets or their parents having to find another place to live.  It would still mean, worst of all, that 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance.  All those things stay the same. This minor change made by the House at the last minute doesn't change any of those things.  For the same reasons TrumpCare 1 only got the support of 17 percent of the American people, TrumpCare 2 will probably have even less support.  All the while, these cuts end up giving a massive tax break to the wealthiest Americans--those making over $250,000 a year, multimillionaires, billionaires. Even insurance executives who make over $500,000 a year will get a tax break, while middle class and older Americans get the short end of the stick. Here we are telling average Americans they are going to get less coverage, they are going to pay more, so we can give the multimillionaires a huge tax break. Who would be for that?  As more and more Americans find out, the vote over there is going to be much less popular even than it is today, and it is very unpopular today, with only 17 percent of Americans liking the bill. It is hard to get lower than that, but I think, as people learn more about this bill, it will get even lower.  The House Republicans have added an amendment that makes the bill even more cruel. It would allow States to opt out of the requirement to cover folks with preexisting conditions for the services they need. God forbid you have a preexisting condition and live in a State that doesn't keep the requirement. Your only option might be a poorly subsidized high-risk pool where you might be forced to wait in line for virtually unaffordable coverage. Remember the death panels scare tactic used against ObamaCare? They didn't actually exist in ObamaCare, but they might in These high-risk pools, with long lines and unaffordable coverage, are the real death panels.  That same amendment means an insurance company can charge an older American even more than five times the amount they are charged under the base bill. It would take us back to the days when insurance companies could price sick people out of insurance and drive older Americans to bankruptcy by charging outlandish rates. That is what House Republicans did with the bill to win more votes. It is unfathomable.  We don't even know how large the negative impact of these changes will be because we don't have a CBO score. Does anyone imagine this amendment will result in even more Americans being insured? Does anyone imagine it will provide better coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions? I don't think so.  That explains why Republican colleagues in the House are rushing it through with hardly any debate, no hearings, and no CBO score. They don't want the American people to see this bill. The leaders of the House were panicked that if they didn't pass the bill today, their Members would go home for 2 weeks--they are on recess over in the House--get beaten up by their constituents who hate this bill, and they would back off.  Only 17 percent of Americans approved of The rest of them packed townhall meetings and public forums to demand that their House Members reject it. They wrote and called, emailed, and contacted Members on social media. Those were the voices of average Americans who stopped the first TrumpCare proposal from even receiving a vote.  Now Republicans are trying to sneak through their second, even worse version of TrumpCare without debate or any analysis of what it would mean for our country. Maybe it raises costs on working Americans even more. Maybe it doubles the amount of uninsured The House won't know before voting on the bill.  I sincerely hope that if this bill passes--I pray it doesn't--the Senate won't mimic the House and try to rush a bill through without hearings or debate or analysis.  Mr.President, regardless of the process, TrumpCare is a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of Americans and break the bank for millions more. I don't know what my friends in the House would say to their constituents if they vote for this bill.  What would you say to a 56-year-old in your district, who is already struggling to balance the cost of medicine and rent and groceries, when she has to pay more than five times as much in healthcare as someone who is 35 and healthy?  What would you say to the mother in your district whose daughter has cancer and who is worried that if she ever lapses in coverage, the insurance company can raise the rates so high on her family that she couldn't afford to get health insurance for her daughter and would have to watch her suffer? The agony a parent would go through. What do you say to that mother?  I don't know how any of my Republican colleagues here in the Senate when we get this bill and now in the House can explain why they voted to rip away people's healthcare.  If there were a Hippocratic Oath for Congress, ``Do no harm,'' TrumpCare would never come up for a vote. It harms the American people in so many ways. It doesn't have to be this way. Republicans could drop these efforts for repeal, drop these attempts that are undermining our healthcare system and causing insurers to flee the marketplace, and come work with Democrats on improving the healthcare system. Our door is open.  So I would just make one final plea to my Republican friends in the I know they rarely listen to Senate leaders, especially Democratic ones, but this is an issue where so much is at stake that I hope they forget party labels at the moment. I ask them to do what representatives should do, something very simple: Think about your[[Page S2743]]constituents. Consult your conscience before you vote for this bill.  I believe if they truly do and consider what every independent expert and medical association is saying about this bill and what it would mean for our healthcare system, they will come to the right conclusion and vote no today.  On one final issue, Mr.President, I see my friend from Florida about to take the floor. I would like to yield to him for a moment, but before I do, I would like to recognize his outstanding efforts in securing additional funding in the appropriations bill for  NASA had actually been targeted for certain cuts by the Trump administration in their budget that would nix the program to send a mission to Europa, a Moon of Thanks to the advocacy of Senator Nelson, NASA will get an overall increase of $368 million in the appropriations bill--enough to fund that mission.

As a young Congressman, he was the second sitting Member of Congress and the first Member in the House to serve on a NASA mission, aboard the space shuttle He has a passion for and a deep knowledge of our space program. There is no one in the Senate who has done more for it than Bill He has worked hard ever since he got to the Senate, and he has had great success.  Once again, he has had a success here today.

The campaign ultimately ended in an Allied victory with the Japanese withdrawal from the Aleutians in 1943, but the effects are still felt by those communities and peoples who were impacted.  Today, before the Senate, I would like to take a moment to honor the sacrifices of our servicemembers, including the 25 Aleut who joined the Armed Forces and the three who participated in the U.invasion to recapture Attu and later received Bronze Stars for their valor. I want to also honor the civilians, the Aleut evacuees, and Attuan prisoners of war whose communities, culture, languages, and lives were forever affected.

1101,topic-id,2301,"Mr.President, we are about to embark on something that is pretty amazing to me. Next week, I am told, we are going to take up the Senate healthcare bill that is going to be the first cousin of the House bill. There are a lot of things that are referred to as putting lipstick on a pig, but this is truly putting lipstick on a pig, where we are going to take healthcare away from millions of  We might make it a little better by extending some Medicare or Medicaid monies, but in the end that will go away. We will potentially set up some high-risk pools for people with preexisting conditions. I will tell you, from my time in the State legislature when we dealt with high-risk pools, that gives access to healthcare for the rich folks.  In essence, what we are going to do next week, because some folks in this body forgot to read the Affordable Care Act when it came up, is we are going to repeal it and we are going to replace it with a piece of garbage.  Today I rise on behalf of the 48 rural and frontier hospitals in Montana--48 rural and frontier hospitals that are the backbone of our  I rise for the 77,000 hard-working Montanans who now have healthcare because of Medicaid expansion, and the 41,000 jobs of our State of 1 million people sustained by our healthcare industry today.  I rise on behalf of every Montanan who deserves to know what is going on in Washington, What is going on back there? Are you guys really talking about jerking my healthcare away from me? Are you guys actually talking about taking something up that is really not going to do much for the 30 million Americans getting pounded by high premiums and high deductibles? Are you doing this to give the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the Americans in this country a tax break?  Right now, the Senate majority in this body is playing Russian roulette with people's lives. A handful of Washington politicians are crafting a secret healthcare bill in a smoke-filled room, probably a little whiskey is involved, a few steaks. They are crafting a bill that will impact every man, woman, and child in this country.  I heard earlier today, they said these meetings were open. It would be nice to know where they are. I would love to go in and give my two bits on what rural America feels about how we need to move forward with healthcare in this country. This is a problem that is not going away unless we address it in a commonsense way.  So they are crafting this bill in secret. We don't know what is in it, but we have indication it is going to be very similar--a first cousin--to the American Health Care Act passed in the House so we should be deeply concerned. This is irresponsible legislation that jeopardizes healthcare for over 250,000 Montanans, denying coverage to over 150,000 Montanans who have a preexisting condition like cancer, heart disease, even high blood pressure, and, quite frankly, would put many of our rural hospitals at risk--at risk of closure; at the very best, changing the methods by which they deliver healthcare to these rural communities, by the way, that are hanging on by[[Page S3636]]their fingernails. This House bill is creating uncertainty in Montana, it is creating uncertainty across this Nation, it will fundamentally change our lives forever, and I do not believe it will be for the better.  My office has received over 3,600 pieces of correspondence related to the American Health Care Many Montanans are terrified of the implications of this horrible bill. As elected officials, we are obligated to answer the tough questions, defend our positions, and advocate for our constituents. That is not what is happening here. As a result, the Senate, through their secret meetings and through a potential rushed-through healthcare bill next week--and I see no reason why it will not be--we are not doing right by our constituents.  The process and this bill are a disservice to folks like Julie Williams from smalltown Montana--Shepherd, Julie was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, MS, in 2011, 5 months before the Supreme Court was set to make their decision on the Affordable Care She spent those 5 months terrified that she was in for a constant fight with insurance companies over coverage, but the Supreme Court upheld the ACA, and Julie has insurance and doesn't have to worry about being denied coverage if she moves, changes jobs, or--God forbid--becomes unemployed because she now has a preexisting condition. Julie also doesn't have to worry about insurance companies cutting off her treatments because she happens to hit a lifetime cap, which is a very real concern for a healthy young woman with a disease like She didn't have to worry--she didn't have to worry until now. If a bill like the American Health Care Act passes, Julie could be charged more because of her disease. She is unable to afford that coverage. The plan may not pay for the healthcare services she needs.  This legislation is also a disservice to a lady with the same last name, no relation, Jennifer Williams, of East Glacier, MT, one of the most beautiful parts of the world. Thanks to the preventive care provisions in the current healthcare system, Jennifer and her husband have been able to catch a few conditions early and avoid bigger problems in the future. That is going away.  Unfortunately, their premiums are rising. Congress needs to address that problem head on. I couldn't agree more. This bill that passed from the House doesn't do that. It will send folks like Julie and 250,000 Montanans on Medicaid out into the cold, no access to affordable care, jack up the cost of healthcare for folks with health insurance, and jack up the cost of healthcare for folks in their fifties and sixties. We can and should be working together to lower those costs for folks like Jennifer, Julie, and other Montana families. Instead, we are here scoring political points--or trying to--upending all the good things in the ACA and the current healthcare system. Instead, we should be working together in The Senate should be working together--not in some back room but right here on the floor--to lower premiums, copays, and deductibles, while increasing access to lifesaving medical care.  Look, we have said it before, we will say it again: The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but it has a lot of good things. Let's fix the things wrong with it and keep the progress we have made, but instead, we hear in Washington, particularly the Republican majority, is creating chaos in the marketplace and driving costs up. This chaos is putting our rural hospitals and community health centers at risk. That is not just the statement. That is a statement of fact.  Every day, folks in rural communities rely on their local hospitals, clinics, everything from basic checkup to emergency treatments. Thanks to Medicaid expansion, in Montana, these hospitals and community health centers have seen a reduction in charity care, and they have been able to keep their doors open, but the American Health Care Act puts those funds at risk and puts these frontier medical centers on the chopping block. These medical professionals are sworn by oath to provide healthcare for folks. If Medicaid expansion goes away, the hospital will be forced to absorb those costs.  Over the last 10 months, I have held over a dozen listening sessions, eyeball-to-eyeball listening sessions with We are going to be holding some more. The sessions have been over health. I have heard one thing loud and clear from people: If Medicaid expansion goes away, these rural frontier hospitals will have to fundamentally change how they deliver healthcare or they may be forced to shut down altogether. These hospitals operate on razor-thin margins, and they cannot afford to see these funds disappear.  Take my hometown, Big Sandy, Back in 1910, my grandfather came out, took a look around, saw grass as tall as the belly on a horse, and said: ``This is where we are going to homestead.'' He went back and got my grandmother. The farm that Sharla and I farm today was started, patented back in 1915. They worked together with their neighbors, the homesteaders of that area. They built barns, they built businesses, but it took them 50 years to build a hospital. In the mid-1960s, a hospital was finally built in Big Sandy, MT--50 years of people working together to get that hospital built.  I am going to tell you, if we don't do smart things in this body, if we take steps backward and not very many--and this bill I have seen from the House is horrible, and I don't think the bill in the Senate is going to be much better because it is a low bar. Hospitals like the hospital in Big Sandy will go away. I am going to tell you something, when that hospital goes away, Big Sandy goes away. Rural America goes away.  Big Sandy is just an example of hundreds of small towns in Montana and throughout this country that depend upon rural hospitals for healthcare. Without hospitals, Montana frontier communities will be forced to drive 100 miles to deliver a baby or take an expensive ambulance ride after an accident. People are not going to be able to afford or they are not going to choose to live there because of a lack of healthcare. They are not going to take that risk. They are going to move out of those small towns, and they are going to move to places where they have healthcare. In some cases, families who have lived in those house and on that property for generations will be forced to move. These hospitals just don't keep patients alive, they keep communities alive. The House bill would kill those rural hospitals and would be the death of rural  That is not the only uncertainty facing rural In Montana, insurance companies filed their proposed rates with the insurance commissioner last year, but these insurers are left without vital information for their proposals. They don't know if this administration will continue the cost-saving reduction payments that help make healthcare more affordable. Insurers have said if these payments go away, consumers will face double-digit rate increases. Montanans deserve to know from their elected officials what kind of impact this action has on premiums, and yet the insurance commissioners are leaving consumers and Montanans in the dark.  Transparency builds a more effective government. Hiding important information from the public is unacceptable at any level of elected official. We live in a country where citizens can hold their government accountable, and the American people make good decisions when they have good information, but right now, a select few in this body are shielding the American public from what is really going on. We hear about a bill that is going to impact one-sixth of the economy, we hear about a piece of legislation that will rip healthcare away from 23 million Americans, we hear about a bill that will take us back to the days when Montanans couldn't afford to get sick, but we haven't seen it.  Families across Montana are sitting at the kitchen table wondering if their healthcare coverage is going to go away. Folks are walking out of the doctors' offices with newfound conditions and wondering: Will I be able to get treatment if something similar to the American Healthcare Act is passed by the Senate? Children are being born prematurely, with asthma and cerebral palsy, and parents are left fearing their son or daughter will never be able to afford insurance.  These families deserve more from At a bare minimum, they deserve hearings. They deserve a panel of[[Page S3637]]experts discussing how we can lower premiums, reduce healthcare costs, and put transparency into prescription drugs. They deserve smart action, not political action. They deserve a Congress that will work together to improve the lives of all Americans, not one that works behind closed doors to draft secret legislation that will send shock waves through homes across this country.  Our Founders expected more from this body. Quite frankly, I expected more from this body before I got here. Montanans expect their U.Senate to work for them.  I am going to leave you with one story. I was in Butte, MT, at one of my listening sessions. A gentleman was sitting at the table. He was probably 45 years old. He said: You know, I have two kids and I can't work. I have had diabetes since I was a teenager. I have had some issues with mental health for a good portion of my adult life.  He said: I haven't been able to work, haven't been able to support my family, and then the Affordable Care Act came along, and the State of Montana was wise enough to pass Medicaid expansion. I was able to go to a doctor. I was able to get my diabetes handled because of Medicaid expansion. I was able to see a psychologist and get my mental health issues under control, and I was able to go back to work. I was able to support my family.  He said: And now you guys in Washington, DC, want to take all that away from me.  I will tell you, I will fight like hell to make sure that never happens. And if the majority leader wants to try to ram this down the people's throats, I will spend the rest of my life telling them why and who did what to them.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

There are some things that are disturbing about it--there is no doubt about that--not to mention the fact that Congress took 7 months to take care of this plan for the long term, which created uncertainty out there on the ground. There were 7 months when Congress sat on their hands, which left towns, hospitals, airports, and our citizenry in the lurch.  But it does do some good things, and I think it does reflect the values of rural America, which I think is really important. I think it is a responsible budget for rural America in States like  One of the things it does that I think is entirely appropriate is that it pushes the Education Department to reconsider the Upward Bound grant applications that were denied because of ridiculous--and I do mean ridiculous--format requirements, which will allow first-generation college kids to be able to go to college.

It gives the Department of Education a pair of glasses so they can apply a little common sense to their rules.

1099,topic-id,869,"Mr.President, it is hard to argue that ObamaCare is not a failing law. Seven years after it became law, its laundry list of problems continues to grow: higher premiums, higher deductibles, customers losing healthcare plans, patients losing doctors, fewer choices, failed co-ops, unraveling exchanges. And, unfortunately, without action, that list will only get longer and the consequences will only become more severe. Republicans know that. Democrats know that. Unfortunately, many Americans know it firsthand.  The American people deserve better, and they rightly expect us to act. That[[Page S3635]]is why choosing to watch from the sidelines as ObamaCare fails is not an option.  To say that ObamaCare has created significant problems for the American people is an understatement. That is why Senate Republicans are working to fix the mess created by ObamaCare to provide real solutions to this failed law. We want to save the millions of hard-working families who are trapped by ObamaCare's taxes and mandates.  Average annual individual market premiums have increased by $2,928--an increase of 105 percent--since 2013 in the 39 States that use healthcare.gov. And 62 percent of States using healthcare.gov, including my home State of South Dakota, saw premiums double between 2013 and 2017. We will help stabilize these collapsing insurance markets that have left millions of Americans with little or no options.  Today, one in three counties has only one insurer on its ObamaCare exchange. According to CMS, 47 counties nationwide are projected to have no insurers, which means Americans in these counties could be without coverage on the exchanges for 2018. As many as 1,200 counties--nearly 40 percent of counties nationwide--could have only one issuer in 2018. It is hard to argue that you have a market, that you have competition, when you have one option. That is 40 percent of the counties in America in 2018.  We will improve the affordability of healthcare by eliminating the ObamaCare taxes and mandates that are causing premiums to increase the most. These taxes and mandates have cost the American economy $1 trillion--a cost that was ultimately incurred by patients in the form of higher costs and larger tax bills. Reversing these taxes will provide millions of American families and businesses with much needed tax relief.  We will also preserve access to care for individuals with preexisting conditions. There has been a lot of debate and misinformation, I might add, about this issue over the past few months. In the Senate, we will ensure that individuals with preexisting conditions continue to have access to the care they depend upon.  We will also safeguard Medicaid by giving States more flexibility, while ensuring that those who rely on this program will not have the rug pulled out from under them. States should have the flexibility to design and operate Medicaid programs in a fiscally responsible way and not be stymied by the Federal  Making these critical reforms to Medicaid will empower States with the tools they need to implement healthcare programs that best meet their residents' needs.  We must also ensure that those Americans who already rely on this program will not be left in the lurch. Republicans recognize our responsibility to make sure that Medicaid continues to provide quality care for these vulnerable citizens. We will balance the needs of the individuals who have Medicaid coverage, while ensuring sustainability of the Medicaid  Finally, we will free the American people from the onerous ObamaCare mandates that, in some cases, forced them to purchase insurance they don't want or can't afford. These mandates have resulted in burdensome taxes that have been levied against most small businesses and the American people. The Republican healthcare plan will revoke these burdensome mandates and put the American people--not Washington--back in charge of their healthcare. This will be a huge leap in the right direction for hard-working families and small businesses.  Reforming America's healthcare system isn't easy, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. We have spent years--literally years--debating this issue, and we have had lots of ideas along the way. Now it is time to take action.  The core principles of the Republican healthcare plan are as follows: helping to stabilize collapsing insurance markets; improving the affordability of health insurance; preserving access to care for those with preexisting conditions; safeguarding Medicaid for those who need it the most; and freeing the American people from onerous ObamaCare mandates.  Without meaningful action, ObamaCare's problems aren't going anywhere. Without action, the individual market will continue to collapse, and more and more Americans will be without insurance options. Without action, Americans will continue to experience rising healthcare costs because of the law's costly taxes and mandates. Without action, States will continue to be hamstrung by Medicaid's bureaucracy, and we will not be able to put this critical program on a more sustainable path for the folks who need it the most. Without action, the ``Washington knows best'' approach to healthcare will live on.  We cannot let that happen, which is why we plan to deliver patient-centered healthcare reforms that lower costs and increase access to care for the American people.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3634-2.txt,1534,1915,2017.0,20.0,July
1091,topic-id,1013,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania for helping cofound the Blue Collar Caucus and just doing a tremendous job. As you know, the hardworking men and women of Pennsylvania, and particularly the Philadelphia area, have been so responsible for many of the things that have really made our country what it is, many of the great public works, many of the amazing museums, and many of the amazing things, bridges, just things like that that people take for granted that there was someone that built those things, there was someone that toiled possibly in the heat and in the snow, but they were able to bring home a good wage doing it. They were able to take care of their families. They were able to send their kids to college.  I love when the gentleman talks about his family and the sacrifices that the gentleman's parents made working in a blue-collar job that ultimately helped him go to one of the most prestigious universities--Notre So I just really appreciate the fact that the gentleman appreciates the hardworking men and women that really make this country great.  We need to do more for them. One of the ways that we can do more for them is to pass an infrastructure bill. I don't think that there is any doubt about that.  We know that this is Infrastructure With roughly $700 billion a year that is being invested at the local, State, and Federal level, infrastructure is vitally important to our economy. We have to have good infrastructure to meet the basic needs of the American people. That may sound like quite a bit of money, but we can't spend enough[[Page H4304]]money to repair and replace our crumbling roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure.  I listened to Elizabeth Esty last night, one of our colleagues from Connecticut, talk about the dangers that are involved in not investing in infrastructure and some of the deaths that tragically have occurred on American roads because of collapsing bridges and things like that. That is not what we want.  We need for the American taxpayer to have confidence that the roads that they are driving on and that the airports that they are using are up to date, that we have the best ports, that we have the best transit systems in this country, and that we have the money to keep those things world-class systems and efficient systems in our country. They have to be safe.                              {time}  2000  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, one out of every five miles of highway pavement in our Nation is in poor condition. That is an estimated 56,000 of the Nation's bridges that are structurally deficient. Think about the truck driver who drives every day, think about the person who makes their living on the road. Think about how many families want their loved ones to travel on safe roads. Think about all of the families who depend on their loved ones to make a living on those roads. That is how they put food on the table at the end of the week, at the end of every 2 weeks, at the end of the month, however they get their check. They need to be safe. Those families need to know that those hardworking men and women who work on those roads every day and use them to help fuel American exceptionalism, they need to know that those roads are safe.  Some estimates say that modernizing our infrastructure to meet our needs is going to require an additional $5 trillion in Federal spending over the next decade. Federal investment in infrastructure is an economic boost that can also create good-paying jobs for blue-collar workers.  I have to tell you, many were encouraged, a lot of people that I know--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--they were very encouraged when the Trump administration floated the idea of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. But instead of presenting a detailed infrastructure plan that puts Americans back to work, the Trump administration has basically offered a plan that lacks details. It doesn't really go into how we are going to get this done.  The reports that I have seen say that the Trump plan, if you want to call it a plan, like I said, contains very few details. It contains tax incentives for private industries that make up as much as 80 percent of the cost of the bill.  Let me tell you two reasons why that is bad. It would simply enrich companies that would have built their projects anyway, and the only private investment it would encourage is for projects that contain a funding stream such as toll roads.  I have to say, if toll roads are the only choice that people have, they will maybe take them. But I know that a bipartisan group of Texans, and I saw this especially when I was in the State legislature before I came to Congress, they are really upset with toll roads. They feel we have too many of them, and they want to see the infrastructure investment that we need in this country to get our roads back up to par and to help relieve congestion.  Encouraging private investment in infrastructure is not necessarily a bad idea, but it requires the proper oversight and the selection of the right kinds of projects. I have to tell you, there is a bipartisan group that believes in that. Both the Obama administration under Secretary Foxx and the Bush Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, they both agree that public-private partnerships are only able to address a small segment of what is needed.  Without careful attention, we risk wasting taxpayer funds by giving big tax breaks to companies on the backs of hardworking American families.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to talk some more later about job creation and about Davis-Bacon and about some other things that need to be addressed, but I want to be sure that we hear from another one of our colleagues and friends from the Rust Belt, ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4303-2.txt,2166,HIRE VETS ACT--Continued,2017.0,17.0,July
1095,topic-id,1262,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative I really appreciate the points he has made tonight, just so timely. It is so important that we talk about those things during Infrastructure Week and the Blue Collar Caucus and the role that the caucus is playing in pointing out a lot of these things that need to be talked about.  Again, when you talk about the infrastructure bill, if we had a legitimate trillion-dollar infrastructure program and it were enacted, we could put the United States back on a prerecession job growth path and, some people say, create close to 11 million jobs.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, infrastructure spending today--that is what we spend on infrastructure spending right now--is directly responsible for about 15.5 million direct and indirect U.jobs, and you are talking about average salaries of $68,000 per year. That is 28 percent above the U.median income. We know that infrastructure jobs pay well. There is absolutely no doubt about that.  Investment in infrastructure also adds more indirect jobs in manufacturing, logistics, transportation, and an increasing demand for steel, glass, concrete; and all those things get the job growth growing in  According to Georgetown University, more than half of the new infrastructure jobs will go to high school graduates and even high school dropouts. So many of our young men who find themselves dropping out end up in the incarceration system, but we know that, if we can find high school dropouts a job and they are not left behind due to economic changes and economic factors, we can help those young men.  According to that same analysis, jobs and occupations that are expected to grow with greater infrastructure investment pay more than typical wages for high school graduates. Engineering and management jobs, which usually require higher levels of education, also offer good opportunities. However, even construction and transportation jobs associated with infrastructure projects provide higher earnings than an average job for high school graduates. The Blue Collar Caucus advocates not only more jobs but, again, better quality jobs.  I used to hear people talk around the dinner table or the domino table or the card table when I was growing up. People wanted to know where the good jobs were, how can you get on at a good job. That is what I am talking about: how we are going to create more of those.  The Davis-Bacon Act, you heard Representative Boyle talk a little bit about that earlier, about how important that is. We should be troubled. When you start talking about good jobs, good-paying jobs, we should be troubled that congressional Republicans have taken steps to repeal the Davis-Bacon  I want to talk a little bit about the Davis-Bacon Act, but first I want to talk about why the Davis-Bacon Act is important. A lot of times in Washington, D.C., we start talking about these terms. People at the Chamber of Commerce, they know what Davis-Bacon is, but maybe the average person has no idea what Davis-Bacon is.  People don't come up to me at the Dollar Store in Fort Worth and say: Hey, Congressman Veasey, hey, Marc, what are we going to do to protect Davis-Bacon? But people do stop me at the Dollar Store and say: Hey, Marc, what are we going to do about putting some more money in our pockets?  That is what Davis-Bacon is all about. That is where the Republicans fail the American worker.  The Davis-Bacon Act requires that certain contractors and subcontractors responsible for carrying out Federal contracts pay their laborers and mechanics the prevailing wages for the area. That is what I am talking about when I say putting more money in your pocket, putting more food on the table, being able to make that light bill, being able to make that car bill, being able to make that truck payment.  I want to sell more cars. We have a General Motors plant in Arlington, Texas, that makes some very good SUVs, good-paying union jobs, good union-made SUVs, American-made SUVs, and you don't get that with lower rates. You get that with the prevailing wage rates that Republicans are trying to do away with. That is what everybody needs to understand.  Ensuring workers are paid a fair wage is extremely important, especially for blue-collar workers. Prevailing wage laws provide protections for both construction workers and the taxpayers. They ensure that all contractors bidding on public construction[[Page H4308]]projects will pay family-supporting wages and that they also ensure projects will be built to the highest standards by skilled, safe, and well-trained construction workers.  Numerous studies have shown, contrary to the claims of corporate interests, that Davis-Bacon wage protections do not increase taxpayers' costs. That is the one thing that you are going to hear from Republicans and downtown business interest people when they want to keep income inequality growing in this country instead of trying to stop income inequality is that Davis-Bacon drives up wages because it allows families to put more food on their table. I think that is a doggone shame.  Fairly paid craftsmen added value to our investments in infrastructure, and Davis-Bacon must continue to be included in any infrastructure plan. Repeal of Davis-Bacon would decrease the quality of blue-collar jobs, and that is a loss that we cannot afford. A repeal of Davis-Bacon would decrease the amount of money that you take home every week or that you take home every 2 weeks, however often you get that check, however often you look for that direct deposit so you can make those bills. If we repeal Davis-Bacon, you will not be making those bills as easy as you were before.  You need to let your Republican Member of Congress know that you want to bring more money home, that you want these prevailing wages, that you do not want to lose these, that it would be absolutely devastating for your family.  Another area that Blue Collar Caucus has talked about, another area that we are going to continue to talk about and that Congress should press forward on in great speed is the Buy America provisions. They have to be in any infrastructure package that we pass.  Buy America generally requires that projects carried out by State and local governments use U.S.-made iron and steel and that they also require domestic production and assembly of other manufactured goods be made right here in the good old  These projects--again, mainly highways, public transportation, aviation--are vitally important to our economy, and ensuring that these projects are made with quality American-made goods means that we get better value and that we put our own people to work. All of this means more and better jobs for hardworking Americans out there.  As we set about rebuilding America's infrastructure, we have to make sure that we are building an economy that works for everyone and not just the corporate interests in this country because, again, we have to do something about income inequality in this country. It is very real. Productivity is up. People's paychecks are stagnant. That is why people still feel the economic pinch and the economic pain, because they see the growth, they see the technology, but they don't see their paychecks getting any fatter--but they do feel themselves struggling more and more and more. We have got to change that.  I would like to again thank Representative Boyle just for being an advocate for the hardworking citizens in the Philadelphia area in his district, just for being a voice on this, and other Members of Congress that came out tonight--",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4303-2.txt,2166,0915,2017.0,17.0,July

After leaving the Army, Reverend Robinson worked for the Dallas Housing Authority from 1946 until he retired in 1976.

On the campaign trail, he promised to fight for the American worker and create jobs right here at home. Since he has taken office, he has done the opposite.  During the first few weeks of his administration, the President signed an executive order to raise mortgage rates for new homeowners. The administration also killed worker protections for individual workers in this country, and then they also have done nothing, absolutely nothing to deal with Davis-Bacon and prevailing wages, which guarantees American workers the right to earn more money. Finally, the administration gutted another protection that would have made it harder for companies to secure Federal contracts if they have a history of labor law violations.  It is more than clear that this administration does not plan to fight for the American worker, the American man and woman out there making it every day in Instead, they are doing everything they can to help the President's billionaire buddies and to promote golf courses and other businesses that they own.

1250,topic-id,359,"Mr.Speaker, first of all, I want to acknowledge the good work of Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith in the Armed Services As my colleague from Alabama said, there is nothing more important than having a secure national defense to protect the American people.  But this bill does have problems. Many of them are not created by the Armed Services They are created by us in  It has been catastrophic for us to have the millstone of the Budget Control Act that is limiting the ability of Congress to make decisions about where to spend more or where to spend less, and two things are happening as a result of that.  Number one, we abdicate our responsibility. In some places we should be spending more, but in many other places we should be spending less.  The second thing, Mr.Speaker, is that we put in straitjackets our managers at the Pentagon and in other programs because we micromanage where they must spend money. If we are going to give them a challenge--the budget cap right now is $549 billion; this bill suggests that we spend close to $700 billion--we have got to give them managerial flexibility and stability.  The Budget Control Act is the ``Budget Paralysis Act.'' That is on all of us here in  Now, a second thing, this bill, in that context, where we are going to blow through that cap but do nothing about our ability to make decisions on the taxes and spending, means that this gets cut totally out of domestic spending. In my view, General Mattis' view is that is bad for national defense.  We plus-up the Defense budget, but we take a hatchet to the State Department budget, not something that you can address in the Armed Services bill, I understand. But the effect of it, as General Mattis said: We have to buy more bullets.  So this is a symptom of the problem that we have got to face squarely.

1165,topic-id,2080,"Today, Mr.President, I rise to speak from the floor of this proud Chamber for the first time. My message today is, at once, a warning and an invitation.  Dear colleagues, as our Senate increasingly grows more partisan, we move further and further away from the practical governance our Founding Fathers espoused, and so today I would like to talk about the principle of the common good in the hopes that this body might be reminded that is our unifying purpose for serving.  Two Hoosiers exemplify the principle of working for the common good that I believe our Founding Fathers envisioned.  Governor Ed Whitcomb was the 43rd Governor of A hero from World War II, he twice escaped capture from the Japanese, making it to safety by swimming through shark-infested waters all night to get to safety. Whitcomb pursued the common good in the midst of a rift in his own Republican He successfully led Indiana in improving our State's highways, mental health services, and creating our State's Higher Education He bucked his own party's interests frequently to do what he thought was right for Governor Whitcomb has been described as Indiana's most amazing He passed away this past year and in tribute Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledged that he served all Hoosiers well.  Coach John Wooden was born and raised in Indiana, and he learned to coach basketball there before heading to UCLA where he became one of the most successful college basketball coaches of all time. Wooden understood the importance of working together as a team, that working together as a team was better than working as individuals. Wooden acknowledged this principle in saying, ``Ten field horses couldn't pull an empty baby carriage if they worked independently of one another.'' He also said, ``If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, you need a team.''  These two Hoosiers remind us that we are here not to work for ourselves or our parties, but the interest of all Americans for the common good of the American people.  Can we perpetuate our Founders' brilliant system to safeguard our liberties by vesting power in the American people themselves?  Our charge is simple, but it will not be easy: for our republican system to endure, we must breathe life back into the notion of the ``common good'' through the relentless application of common sense.  Now, I don't profess that Hoosiers have a monopoly on the common good, but rather than allowing ideological labels to guide policymaking decisions, we should instead be guided by what we in Indiana call Hoosier common sense. It is the notion that we should be guided by the facts, and that we are open to change or new ideas, regardless of ideology, when presented with results.  The common good--I happen to know from personal experience that any young boy or girl who grows up in Indiana already has a keen sense of the thing.  I was raised in a place where neighbor cared for neighbor. This is the common good in practice.  I lived among people of character who made others' concerns their own concerns. This is the common good.  I benefited from the selfless contributions of Americans who invested their own time, their own attention, their own resources and talents into helping their fellow This is the common good.  I came to know rank-and-file citizens who quietly took the initiative to care for the forgotten Hoosiers who needed a hand up. This is the common good.  With respect, my colleagues, I note that this outline of the common good would fully satisfy any ordinary rank-and-file Hoosier, and most ordinary Americans, but sadly, in our modern politics sometimes our most stubborn partisans resist even the most self-evident truths. Forgive me as I must demonstrate that what works in practice also works in theory.  I will borrow from 18th century political theorist and English statesman Edmund Burke, for he brightly illuminated this notion of a common good. Burke argued that the common good could only exist where rule of law exists. Rule of law, properly understood, requires a shared allegiance by which people entrust their collective destiny to others who can speak and decide in their name. This, said Burke, is a partnership between the living, the unborn, and the dead.  The common good requires individual cooperation and compromise.  Burke noted that individuals are not simply a compendium of human wants and individual happiness is not realized by merely satisfying those wants. Our own happiness is linked to one another's happiness.  Our purpose, then--our duty--in both our private and public capacities, is to preserve a social order which addresses the needs of generations past, present, and future. This is our duty.  In the Marine Corps, I learned something about duty and practice. Marine leaders of every rank teach through the power of their example that every marine has a duty to serve a cause greater than themselves. Marines learn to venerate sacrifice for the greater good. We are trained to refrain from self-indulgent behavior, to check our egos at the door, and to never let ambition interfere with judgment.  For marines, our comrades' lives and our country's future depends on embracing uncomfortable facts and then improvising, adapting, and overcoming those facts together.  Of course, in the marines, there was no red State or blue Every marine fights for red, white, and blue. Marines don't have the luxury of stubbornly clinging to false doctrines or failed practices, and neither do we. Every day our men and women who wear the uniform from every branch take up arms ``to provide for the common defense''--come what may.  Colleagues, if we are to keep the Republic, we too must remain open to fact-based conversations, to new information, and to new, better approaches.  Now look, I understand that this is not the United States Marine We have been issued a pen and a microphone, not rifles, but like the marines, we should be working to advance a common mission, common goals. We are the trustees of the common good.  Now, please don't misunderstand me. As a marine, I like a good fight as much as the next guy, but let's resolve whenever possible to fight together because I know most assuredly we are fighting for the same people--and, in most cases, we are fighting for the same ends.  I am fighting for Steve, a self-employed laborer from Steve's in his fifties, but he hasn't seen his takehome pay increase in decades. Colleagues, you are fighting for Steve, too.  I am fighting for Whitney, a high school student from Whitney doesn't come from money, and she worries about the future. She is a hard-working student who helps her family how she can through a part-time job, but Whitney doesn't know if she can afford a college education. Colleagues, you are fighting for Whitney, too.

Let's come together to help Americans acquire the skills to meaningfully participate in this 21st century economy.

ISAs keep score with outcomes, so people aren't punished if they are unemployed or have low incomes.  Let's come together to better serve the poor, the vulnerable, those on the margins of society.

Let's come together to restore confidence in our foreign policy and protect our men and women in uniform. While we rebuild our military, let's ensure we are optimizing every instrument of national power. The American people won't tolerate wasteful or ineffective foreign aid expenditures, but they will continue to support investments in smart, effective diplomacy.  Let's work with this administration to reform the State Department and foreign bodies like the United  Earlier, colleagues, I spoke of a former Republican Governor of Indiana, Ed Whitcomb--but there was another Whitcomb who was Governor, James Whitcomb, a Democrat, who also went on to serve in this body before passing. He also made his mark as Governor, saving the State from insolvency, establishing institutions for the physically and mentally handicapped, and advancing the first system of free public education.  But even more impressive is his dedication to those Hoosiers who fought from Indiana in the Mexican-American With Indiana's budget broke and our credit in shambles, Whitcomb took out personal loans to purchase arms and send these Hoosiers out in service of our Two Whitcombs, one Republican and one Democrat, who served our State and Nation for the common good.  In closing, colleagues, allow me to acknowledge that folks in your States probably feel a lot like those in Indiana: they are frustrated by our failure, and the Federal Government's failure to live up to the high expectations Americans have for other pillars of our public life--our churches, our State governments, and so on. Where good old Hoosier common sense seems to inform work in those areas, in Washington, our common sense is too often crowded out by stale partisan battles and unyielding ideological biases.  Colleagues, our charge, our duty, is to advance the common good by identifying common goals and then using common sense to further advance those goals.  In spite of our principled disagreements, let us disagree without questioning each other's motives; let us work through tough problems. Let us be principled in our beliefs but pragmatic in advancing those beliefs. Let us adapt to new realities. Let us have the courage to change our minds. Let us put results over rhetoric. Let us find practical solutions to pressing challenges. Let us, first and foremost, never forget that we are custodians of the common good.  My fellow Americans, let us rededicate ourselves to remain one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Thank you.
