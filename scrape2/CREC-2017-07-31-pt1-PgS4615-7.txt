                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICK SHEEHAN

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Patrick for his hard work as 
an intern in my Casper office. I recognize his efforts and 
contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Patrick is a native of Casper, WY. He currently attends the 
University of Wyoming, where he is studying organizational leadership. 
He has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made him an 
invaluable asset to our office. The quality of his work is reflected in 
his great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Patrick for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
