                      MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to 
recognize Military Appreciation Month.
  This month allows us the opportunity to educate Americans regarding 
the impact our military has had throughout history.
  This month allows us to honor the important men and women who have 
served and who are serving in uniform.
  Mr. Speaker, this month allows us to celebrate over 90 million 
patriots who chose to put our country before themselves.
  As a Representative of the 25th Congressional District of Texas, it 
is my

honor to represent Fort Hood Army Base. I am proud to speak on behalf 
of ``The Great Place.'' Located in Killeen, Texas, this 340-square-mile 
installation is the gold standard for the Army.
  My visits to Fort Hood have given me a deeper appreciation for our 
military and their families. This appreciation is why I would like to 
recognize Memorial Day, which we will all celebrate on Monday, May 29.
  This day reminds us of the brave men and women who gave up their 
todays so we could have our tomorrows. It gives us a chance to say 
thank you to a soldier, sailor, airman, coastguardsman, or a marine. 
Please join me in paying tribute to military members who have given our 
country the ultimate sacrifice.
  May God bless our troops. God bless The Great Place, and God bless 
the United States of America.
  In God we trust.
