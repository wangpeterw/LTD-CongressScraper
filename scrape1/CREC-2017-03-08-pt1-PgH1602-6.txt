          INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY AND A DAY WITHOUT A WOMAN

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of International 
Women's Day and to join the countless women across this Nation in 
participating today and, yes, dressed in red to celebrate our 
achievements of women across the world in many fields.
  I stand with the women today to highlight the economic injustices 
women face: unequal pay, unpaid leave, gender discrimination, and the 
list

goes on. Oh, yes, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Women are the primary breadwinners. Six out of 10 American women are 
paid only 80 cents on the dollar, and for women of color like me, 64 
cents.
  But today it is so important for us to say we are faced with the 
dangerous and irresponsible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which 
will once again make being a female a preexisting condition and take 
away access to free preventative services like mammograms and cervical 
cancer screening.
  You should ask yourself: Why are they doing this markup without 
hearings? You should ask yourself: Why should families pay more? Why 
should those with disabilities and preexisting conditions pay more? Why 
should billionaires benefit more?
  Stand with us women on International Women's Day.
