            By Mr. GALLAGHER:
        H.J. Res. 85.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article V: ``The Congress, whenever two thirds of both 
     houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to 
     this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures 
     of two thirds of several states, shall call a convention for 
     proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid 
     to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, 
     when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the 
     several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, 
     as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed 
     by the Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made 
     prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall 
     in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the 
     ninth section of the first article; and that no state, 
     without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage 
     in the Senate.''
