                           SYRIAN ATROCITIES

  (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, recent State Department 
revelations show that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad continues 
inflicting atrocities on his own people. The discovery of a crematorium 
at Saydnaya military prison will only make it more difficult to account 
for the thousands detained and executed by Assad.
  According to numerous nongovernmental organizations, the Assad regime 
has abducted and detained between 65,000 and 117,000 people between 
2011 and 2015. Credible reports have the regime executing up to 50 
people daily. Assad uses the excuse of fighting terrorism to justify 
this gross campaign of inhumanity against innocent civilians. We know 
he has used mass graves and crematoriums to dispose of the corpses of 
the murdered. The savagery must stop.
  I am proud to represent many Syrian Americans in Charleston, West 
Virginia. I urge my colleagues to join me in publicly condemning the 
atrocities committed by the Syrian regime of President Assad. Syrians 
deserve to be safe and free.
