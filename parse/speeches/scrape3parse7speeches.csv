171,topic-id,221,"Mr.Speaker, I strongly support the reauthorization of the United States Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, the Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program, and the SAFER grant program.  These programs are vital to protect the public and the Nation's firefighters. Recent trends have shown that fire safety and prevention remains a serious national concern. Data from the U.Fire Administration shows that, while there are fewer fires and fire-related deaths overall, fires are becoming more severe and costly in both lives lost and property damage per fire. The best-trained, best-equipped firefighters cannot always overcome the dangers associated with today's severe fires.  This alarming trend jeopardizes the economic health of our communities and our national goal of increased resilience to fire. Adequate funding for the brave men and women who fight fires is essential, but we must also be effective in reducing these trends by preventing the fire's ignition and growth, in the first place, through robust fire prevention.  I will work with the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to request that the U.First Administration and FEMA investigate the upward trend in fatalities and property damage per fire.  Mr.Speaker, I thank both Chairman Smith and subcommittee Chairwoman Comstock for their leadership and hard work on the reauthorization bill, and I hope to work with them to address these issues moving forward.

396,topic-id,655,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act introduced by my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Williams).  Since the seizure of the U.Embassy and the taking of 66 American hostages during the 1979 revolution, Iran has taken a long view on its global ambition, supporting terrorist proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in  From 1983, when Iran-supported Hezbollah bombed a U.Marines barracks in Lebanon, killing 243 servicemembers, to the killing of over 500 soldiers in Iraq by the elite Quds Force leader, Qasem Soleimani, Iran has earned its reputation as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.  Most recently, Iran Air, an Iranian state-owned airline, was sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2011 for using its commercial passenger aircraft to transport weapons to terrorists helping the Assad regime in Syria and for transporting military cargo to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard This is in addition to what the world already well knows, that the Iranian regime has covered up and lied about its nuclear program for decades, deceiving international inspectors, agreeing to intrusive inspections, and then allowing those inspections to be implemented only provisionally and selectively.  Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, regularly chants ``Death to America'' and ultimately calls for the annihilation of the Jewish people.  In 2015, the Obama administration made a historic mistake by agreeing to the ill-conceived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or as it is also called, the Iran nuclear agreement or The agreement removed financial sanctions on Iran, enabling greater financial resources for Iranian-funded terrorism.  Adding insult to injury, later, in 2016, due to the agreement, the Obama Treasury Department authorized the sale of more than 200 planes to Iran, the same Iranian airline that was sanctioned in 2011, and the Department also authorized U.banks to finance these transactions. But there is evidence that the carrier has continued its illicit behavior.  According to an April 2017 hearing in our subcommittee, Emanuele Ottolenghi, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, testified that Iran Air operated at least 114 flights to Syria between January 16, 2016, which was Implementation Day of the JCPOA, and March 30, 2017. These flights are known as weapons resupply routes and stopovers in Iran with a suspected IRGC logistical hub that supports airlifts to the Assad regime.  In communications with the committee, Ottolenghi later confirmed that Iran Air had run at least 134 such flights between Implementation Day and May 4, 2017, which means the Iran nuclear agreement facilitated Iran helping the brutal murderous regime of  In exchange, what did the United States get out of this?  Only managed access to suspect nuclear sites in which international inspectors must appeal to Iran, Russia, and China in a bureaucratic process that takes at least 24 days, during which Iran can remove anything covert and in violation of the agreement.  International inspectors have also been denied access to military sites, the most likely places in Iran where illicit nuclear activity is occurring. But even if the JCPOA was delivering on its core promise of a denuclearized Iran, the agreement was sold with specific assurance that the JCPOA would not limit the United States' ability to stop Iran's nonnuclear activities and their support of terror activities.  Then Secretary of State John Kerry, in defense of the agreement, selling the[[Page H9885]]agreement to Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, testified that: ``If we catch them funding terrorism, they are going to have a problem with the U.Congress.''  Mr.Speaker, apparently not, because Members of Congress don't have a problem with this evidence that Iran is funding terrorist proxies and the Assad regime.  For these reasons, it is imperative that Congress pass the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act, which would require the Treasury to provide a report to Congress describing these connections. This is a reporting bill. Even if you support the JCPOA, you should support congressional oversight.

713,topic-id,1380,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about the tax relief and tax reduction legislation that the conference committee is currently working on. To me and to all Americans, this is a very important piece of legislation. I think it is going to get even better as the House and the Senate work to hammer out the differences to help lower the tax rates for American families.  When you look at this legislation, there are so many policies that will help to make America's economy grow. Families across the country will get a tax break. It is what they need. It is what they have been looking for, for a long time. Main Street businesses will also get a tax break. When people get a raise like that, they invest in their families, and they invest in their communities. They create jobs. Wages go up. The economy grows, and our Nation gets stronger.  You don't have to take my word for it. Respected mainstream economists are saying exactly the same thing. They agree that our economy needs to grow. They agree that the legislation we are working on--which passed the Senate, passed the House, and is being joined together--will deliver the growth that our Nation needs.  In October the Council of Economic Advisers put out a report looking at some of the ideas for tax relief. This is a group that advises the President on economic issues. Their report found that the tax plan, like the one Republicans wrote, will grow the economy between 3 percent and 5 percent. That is real growth. It is strong growth, and it is good news for  There was another study that came out in That was by a group of[[Page S7993]]economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston They did their own calculations and used their own numbers, and they found the exact same good news for the American economy. Just like the other report, this one said that the Republican tax plan would grow the economy by between 3 percent and 5 percent.  A third study was released in It was by the Tax Again, it is a respected group of economists who study this kind of issue for a living. They looked specifically at the legislation as it was introduced in the Senate Finance Committee and, then, passing the This group found that the plan would increase the size of the economy by 3.7 percent. That is the same range, between 3 and 5 percent, but more specifically, 3.7 percent.  Then, there was a fourth analysis by one more group of nine respected independent economists. This group wrote about their conclusions in a letter to the Treasury Secretary on November 26. They wrote that they expect this tax relief plan to boost the economy by 3 percent over the next 10 years.  We have four different entities, four different estimates, four different groups of prominent economists. They looked at the tax relief plan. They looked at it in different ways and used different analyses, and they all found that it would grow the American economy by very similar amounts, all by at least 3 percent.  There was one other study that some people have been talking about. This was an estimate by a group called the Joint Committee on This group predicts that growth under the Republican plan will increase, but by just 0.8 percent over those next 10 years. That works out, roughly, to eight one-hundredths of 1 percent a year. All of these other groups say at least 3 percent, maybe 5 percent, and this other group says less than 1 percent over a decade. It is hard to believe.  Why is this one group, which is being quoted often by the Democrats, so far out of line, out of the mainstream, with what other economists are saying? The reason they reached such a different conclusion is that they did their analysis very differently from all the other groups. This committee combines a few different economic models into their estimate. That is reasonable. When we look closely at the models they combined, we found that they counted the most pessimistic models much more heavily than they did the more realistic models. So, of course, they are going to come up with an overly pessimistic conclusion.  I think it can be useful to take these more negative views into account. Nobody thinks we should just pick from the rosiest scenario or base our policies on one prediction. That is not what is happening here. We have four different groups of economists that predict strong economic growth of at least 3 percent. The one outlier is much more pessimistic, much more cautious.  Another thing to remember is that even this very cautious estimate says that the economy will get bigger because of the Republican plan than if we did nothing at all. Even the pessimistic group is saying: Oh, yes, the economy will grow under the Republican plan. They say it will reduce deficits by an additional $400 billion over the next 10 years.  I think we are going to do a whole lot better than that because our economy is going to grow much faster. Under President Obama and Washington Democrats, we had 8 years of policies that held back our economy and caused it to grow at a very tepid, slow pace. Economists looked at these policies, and they said that if things continue on that path, we can expect the economy to grow by about the 1.8 percent we have been seeing through the Obama administration.  With Republicans setting the agenda, those policies are history and so is this slow economic growth that had been created during the Obama years. Look what just happened in the last two economic quarters of this year. Over these 6 months, our economy grew at a pace of more than 3 percent. The economy has created more than 2 million jobs since President Trump was elected a little over a year ago. The economy is responding--responding to policies that Republicans have been talking about and to what we have been doing in terms of eliminating so many punishing, burdensome, expensive regulations that have caused such a drag on our economy.  When we pass legislation like this tax relief act, it will give businesses confidence that we are keeping our promises. It gives them confidence that they can keep hiring, keep investing, and keep creating more jobs.  Take a look at the fact that there are 2 million more new jobs since election day of last year. Someone said: Oh, no, you have to wait until Inauguration Day to start counting. I disagree. I will tell you that in my home State of Wyoming, on election night, when the results were in and it was known that Donald Trump had been elected President of the United States, there was immediate optimism, immediate confidence, and an immediate positive spring in people's steps. The decision at that point by the American electorate said: Yes, it is time for this economy to take off. And it has.  When someone comes out with an estimate about economic growth and they don't take into account all of these different things, I think, maybe, they are living in the past, when they were looking at an economic growth model of 1.8 percent. I think, maybe, they got so used to the anemic growth we had in the Obama years that they are still expecting that to continue into the future. They are not taking into account that things are different now, that Republicans are passing our economic plans, and that the burdensome regulations and the redtape has been cut. They are not taking into account that President Trump is in the White  Those things make a very big difference when it comes to sustaining this progress that we have seen over the past year. Four out of five studies agree that the Republican tax plan will deliver the kind of economic growth that the American people want and the American economy needs--a strong, healthy, and growing economy.

Congresswoman Kelly is a stalwart leader against gun violence and serves as a visible, out-front advocate for putting an end to the gun violence epidemic.  Far too many children, families, and communities have been devastated and destroyed by a gun inappropriately in the hands of a shooter.

Mr.Speaker, I will never forget the Sandy Hook tragedy that happened 5 years ago tomorrow. It was like yesterday.  I was at Harvard I was seated next to Congresswoman Esty when the news broke about the shooting in the district she had just been elected to serve.  The more we learned that day, the more devastating and heartbreaking the news became. Innocent children were taken away from their parents, from their brothers and sisters, and from their community.  I hoped and prayed that day that we would never see a tragedy like Sandy But, of course, our country continues to be unique in the number of people we have lost to mass shootings and gun violence.  As a Member of Congress, I cannot stand by and allow our communities to continue to be upturned by the loss of innocent lives. There are too many things we can do to address this epidemic.  We should allow Federal agencies to study gun violence as a public health crisis, because it is. We should keep guns out of the hands of individuals on the terrorist watch list and those convicted of hate crimes. We should close the gun show loopholes, Mr.Speaker, and reinstate the assault weapons ban.  You will note that none of the proposals I just mentioned would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment or limit the ability of Americans to protect themselves or their families. So there should be no reason why our Republican colleagues can't join us and pass sensible reforms that will save lives, like the lives we could have saved at Sandy  I hope and pray that this Congress has the courage to curb this epidemic of gun violence, because I don't want to continue to see the Sandy Hooks, the Charleston Nines, the Orlandos, or what we saw this year in cities like Las Vegas or small towns like Sutherland  One of the things we can do to honor the memory of the victims of those tragedies and all victims of gun violence is to make sure that no more families have to experience the same senseless loss.

789,topic-id,3795,"Mr.President, I come to the floor tonight, once again, to talk about this tax bill being rushed through the House and the This is the first time in 31 years that a tax bill of this magnitude has been considered. I don't refer to this as tax reform because it is barely reforming anything.  It seems a shame that we didn't follow in the footsteps of what then-President Reagan chose to do when he had the opportunity to reform the Tax The bill he worked on, which was every bit as consequential as the one in front of us, commanded the vast majority of votes in this Chamber--Democrats and Republicans voting together--after years of process, years of committee hearings, years of hearings even out in the country, listening to business owners, economists, and citizens talk about what they thought our[[Page S8065]]Tax Code needed to be competitive and to be fair to the American people.  I would say through the Chair to the pages that I was in college when the last bill was passed. Now, 31 years later, we are on the verge of passing a bill in the Senate without one Democratic vote--not a single one--and without a single hearing in the Senate Finance Committee, on which I serve--not a single hearing about the text of this bill, not a single hearing to tell the American people that, on the individual side of this bill, we are borrowing $34 billion from our kids to give a tax cut to the 572,000 taxpayers who are fortunate enough to make more than $1 million a year. That is 572,000 taxpayers who are fortunate enough to make $1 million a year. We think it is so essential that each one of them get a $59,000 tax cut that we are willing to borrow that money from our children to do it. We can't think of a better use than that.  A better use is not to give a tax cut to the middle class, because we know what those numbers look like in this bill. There are not a half million people who make $50,000 and less in this economy. There are 90 million people. Those people are not getting $34 billion. Those people are getting $13 billion. If we do the math, it adds up to about $160, on average, per taxpayer making $50,000 or less, in the first year. That is the best year. So 2019 is the best year. That $160 per taxpayer works out to about $7.50 a paycheck.  So we are justifying $34 billion going to 572,000 families because we say at the essence of this is a tax cut for the middle class that is worth $7.50. I think it is disgraceful to call this a middle-class tax cut. What is as disgraceful is the fact that we are blowing a $1.4 trillion hole in our deficit.  There are people on the other side--and I grant them this--who say we will grow out of this and that the tax cut will pay for itself. This is exactly what President Bush said in 2001, when he cut taxes. It is exactly what he said in 2003, when he cut taxes. Remember that when George Bush became President of this country, he inherited a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. Then, he cut taxes and said it would pay for itself, in 2001. He cut taxes and said it would pay for itself, in 2003. We invaded We invaded Not only did he not ask the American people to pay for those wars, but the 2003 tax cut actually came after the invasion of  Today we have massive readiness problems with our military. Today we confront the potential for conflict on the Korean Today we confront uncertainties in the Middle East and behavior by Russia that we need to worry about. Are we going to go in debt to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut they are not asking for?  I am more sympathetic on the corporate side. I believe our corporate rate is too high. If we had worked in a bipartisan way, I think we could have gotten to a deal that 75 or 80 people would have voted for. That would have been beneficial for two reasons. It would have represented more widely the American people's view of what we ought to do here. I have heard the majority leader on the floor talking about partisan efforts like this, and how they are doomed to fail because most of the American people will not support it. We can see that in the polling numbers on this bill. But we could have cut a deal that said: Let's bring our corporate rate down to 25 percent. By the way, let's get rid of some of those loopholes. As for all of the stuff we said over the years about lowering the rate and broadening the base, let's actually do that.  That is not what this bill does. This bill cuts the corporate rate to 20 percent and leaves all of the loopholes in place. There is no broadening of the base. So if the effective rate today is actually in the low twenties, even though the published rate is 35 percent, the effective rate is going to be far below 20 percent if we don't actually reform the Tax  I think there would have been bipartisan agreement about doing something with the earned income tax credit or the child tax credit, as my colleague from Florida has tried to do to a degree. I think there would have been bipartisan support for the idea that we ought to do something to repatriate the money stuck overseas and invest it here in the United States in infrastructure. But there was no effort to make a bipartisan effort here--none.  There have certainly been cases where Democrats have been guilty of that. This is a profound case of the Republicans being guilty of that, and the result is that they have a lousy bill that speaks to the extreme wing of their party rather than to the middle of America, because only in that way could you end up with a piece of legislation that the President is describing as a middle-class tax cut that is not one. Nothing about the math in this tax bill suggests it is.  By the way, the $34 billion I talked about does not include the estate tax. When we include the increase of the estates not subject to the estate tax in this bill, it adds, on average, another $10,000. Now we are talking about borrowing $69,000. So we are now borrowing an additional $10,000 from the sons and daughters of police officers, firefighters, and teachers in order to finance an estate tax cut that we will not pay for.  Pay for it. Don't borrow the money.  I got here 9 years ago at the depth of the worst recession since the Great Our economy had locked up. Because of the two tax cuts under President Bush, because of the two wars we didn't have the decency to pay for, and because President Bush passed so-called Medicare Part D--which is a prescription drug program for seniors that he didn't pay for--and then with the supply-side economics, they drove our economy into the worst ditch since the Great  When President Obama showed up, the surplus was not a surplus. It was a $1.5 trillion deficit. I was here when we tried to work in a bipartisan way to figure out how to respond to a terrifying circumstance--not for the Senate but for our country.  A woman who came to a townhall told me that her plan was to die sooner because overnight she had lost half of her net worth, and she didn't know how to make it through because the stock market had cratered and her pension was cut in half.  We had more than a 10-percent unemployment rate in the United States of America, and we couldn't get a single person to lift their finger on the other side of the aisle because they said that the deficit was too big. They said that President Obama was pursuing what the pollsters told them was ``job-killing government spending.'' Those were the words. It wasn't his $1.5 trillion deficit; that is what he inherited. He left with about a $550 billion deficit. It was cut by two-thirds.  Today, we stand here talking about this absolutely irresponsible tax bill. It is already at $666 billion. We have a government where we are collecting 18 percent of the GDP in revenue. It is actually about 17.9 percent before this tax cut goes through. We are spending more than 21 percent, and our answer is: Let's cut some more taxes, so we will be spending 17 and change. That is a big delta--17 to 21. That is a conversation we should be having together, not in pieces.  All of these people who say: Don't worry about it; it will pay for itself--remember what they said in 2001 and 2003. They said the same thing. They are going to show up here after this Christmas season has passed, and they are going to say: That is why we need to cut Medicaid and  There is no doubt we have to have a conversation about the sustainability of these programs, and there is no doubt we have to have a discussion about how we are going to get out of the fiscal issues we confront. I have no doubt that the moment we face the next crisis, whether it is a national security crisis or an economic crisis, we are going to wish we hadn't passed this tax bill. We are going to wish that when this economy was at full employment, when interest rates are what they are, that we had thought about how to come together in a bipartisan way and actually do something responsible for once.  There is a mayor in Indiana who sent an op-ed piece to the Washington Post last week. He said: Let me break this down for you in terms of my local community. The equivalent of what the Republican tax bill is for my community would be that we would go out and borrow $400 million, which is a staggering sum, not billions and billions of dollars but, on the basis of the size of their government, $400 million--four or five times what our indebtedness is today.[[Page S8066]]  Then, what I would do is say: We didn't borrow this money to build infrastructure. We didn't borrow this money to make sure we end poverty in my community or to make sure the water is clean. We gave it to the people in the biggest houses, the richest neighborhoods in our community, hoping that somehow the benefits would trickle down to everybody else.  He said that they would be run out on the rail--and they should be.  There are some politicians who say that it will pay for itself. There is no economist who has said that this is not going to create a deficit. There is probably a consensus, around $1.4 trillion--I have seen some math that says $1 trillion, and others that say $2.5 trillion. Let's take the $1.4 trillion and consider, as an order of magnitude, if we didn't care about our deficit--which apparently we don't anymore--what else we could spend the money on besides giving this tax cut to the very wealthiest Americans in our country.  In the 9 years I have been here, we have gone from no opioid crisis to an opioid crisis that is killing 50,000 There are communities all over our States, especially in rural parts of the States, where we have no answer. We have provided no additional treatment, even though we have an emergency today that we didn't have before. That is not the America I grew up in. That is not the America our parents and grandparents set up for us. Look at what you can do to create treatment in every United States county for 10 years. That is this $60 billion. That is this little orange part of a $1.4 trillion hole in our deficit. That is one thing you could do.  Another thing you could do would be to provide universal pre-K for low-income children for a decade. That might be worth borrowing from the next generation for because they would actually be getting a benefit. They are not getting any benefit from this $59,000 that we are giving to people who make more than $1 million a year.  You could double Federal funding for research and development on clean energy for over a decade. You could maintain our technological advantage over China in emerging industries for a decade. That is a huge concern. That would be $50 billion, just this little slice--a foregone priority if we pass this bill, just like the response to opioids. You could fund a 20-man mission to Because of our fecklessness, we can't even put an astronaut into space without putting them on a Russian rocket. That has nothing to do with our lacking the engineering talent. That has nothing to do with our lacking imagination or, for some of us, a sense of mission. It has to do with the fecklessness of this Congress and the inability of it to walk and chew gum at the same time.  We could repair all of America's aging dams, which our parents and grandparents were thoughtful enough to build for us but which we feel we don't need to maintain for the next generation of We would rather give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in  You could end the backlog of infrastructure repairs in America's airports--end it. Five years of funding, that is only $100 billion. I say ``only.'' That is a huge number, but not compared to $1.4 trillion.  You could end the U.Air Force pilot shortage. Why do we have a shortage of Air Force pilots? Because this place, for 9 years, has run itself on continuing resolutions. The military can't plan, so we have airplanes that are being scavenged for parts and cannot fly. If they can't fly, the pilots can't get the training hours. If they can't get the training hours, they can't move ahead in their careers, and they can't be ready when the battle comes. You could easily pay for that here.  You could fund the first 5 years of the Navy's plan to build a 355-ship fleet. Everyone around here walks around saying: We don't have any money; we are broke. It is matter of choices and priorities. I cannot think of a set of priorities less out of whack with what Republicans think of in Colorado, much less our Democrats and  Here is one we really do care about in Colorado and all across the country. You could pay for all deferred maintenance at our national parks and other land management agencies. That is right here, this tiny purple square--$19 billion. If you look at the bottom right, that includes over a dozen priorities for rural communities that have been kicked around by this Congress and our CRs year after year.  Here are a few things that fit in there. Extend high-speed internet to every rural community in That might be a good use of money or a good reason to borrow money--to extend high-speed internet to people who don't have it. This is a world where telling a kid in a rural school that they don't have access to high-speed internet is no different than telling them: Sorry, you are not getting textbooks, but these other kids do.  We could reimburse rural areas with significant public lands for lost tax revenue, the PILT payment.  I promise my colleague from Pennsylvania I am coming to the end. I know he doesn't believe it.  These PILT payments are a pain point for my rural counties. Every year we go through the same nonsense at the end of the year. Every single year they say: Is it going to be funded in the CR? They are using it to pay for something else. Yet it would cost a tiny fraction of just the rural priorities part of it. That is $111 billion for all the rural priorities. Eliminating the national backlog for the USDA rural water program--can you imagine what that would mean for rural America and economic development in rural America? They wouldn't have to wait for someone in New York to trickle down to them because they would have an investment in their community. It would create jobs. It would allow them to do economic development and keep their children in their communities and their schools open and their banks open. That is not a priority for the people writing and voting for this bill.  President Trump cut Essential Air Service in his budget--zeroed it out. We could fund Essential Air Service for 10 years, providing a critical economic lifeline to small towns across America and in my  We could fund the U.Forest Service fires suppression for a decade, so they wouldn't have to keep cannibalizing other parts of the budget. This year, for the first year, they spent more than half of their budget fighting fires because we don't have the sense to budget them so that they can do fire mitigation. Talk about penny wise and pound foolish.  In Colorado, we could clean up the Gold King Mine spill, fund the Arkansas Valley Conduit to provide drinking water to some of the poorest areas in Southeastern Colorado, which we have been promised since John Kennedy was President of the United  We could do everything I just mentioned, all of these investments--infrastructure, research, public health, housing, national security, and rural communities--for the cost of this tax plan. This is yet another illustration of how profoundly Washington's priorities have decoupled from the priorities of the American people. Beyond that, this bill confirms every other suspicion about how Washington operates.  President Trump ran for office saying that he would drain the swamp. This tax plan is a creature of the swamp. It was jammed through with last-minute changes, scribbled by hand in the dark of the night, with 2 a.m. votes--shameful, 2 a.m. votes on legislation that no one had a chance to fully understand. There was input from lobbyists on K Street but not a single hearing where the American people could express their view.  Given the process, it should surprise no one that the bill substituted the priorities of the American people with a litany of carve-outs and loopholes that powerful special interests have gotten into this bill.  I am going to skip this part because I want to yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, but let me just finish by saying that today, incredibly in America, the top 10 percent of earners take home more than half of America's income. We have not seen that since 1928, the year before the Great I know the President knows these folks as well as I do. Everybody on this chart is working hard, whether it is the top 10 percent or the bottom 90 percent, but this is not the way our economy ought to work. For almost all of our history, this is not the way it did work.  I was a businessperson before I came to Congress, before I was a school superintendent. I have nothing against[[Page S8067]]anyone who has done well, but it is preposterous to suggest that the real problem in our economy, when we have a record stock market and record income inequality, is that wealthy individuals and businesses don't have enough.  My final chart is this chart, which shows median household income. Since 1980 until now, the cost of housing, cost of higher education, and cost of healthcare--we have done nothing to address or help this. We have turned our back on this.  I think we could have written a bill, as I said at the outset, that had a real middle-class tax cut in it, but we chose not to do it.  Last year, I met a mom in Rifle, CO, at an early childhood center. In the course of our conversation, she said to me: ``I've got a job so I can have health insurance, and every single dollar I earn goes to pay for this early childhood center, so I can work.''  That is the story of too many people in my My State has one of the most dynamic economies in the United States of America, and still too many people whom I represent are middle-class families whose incomes haven't really gone up, not over 10 years but since 1980, for whom the cost of housing, cost of healthcare, cost of higher education, and the cost of early childhood education have conspired to create for them impossible choices that their parents and grandparents never had to make.  Tax reform should have been the opportunity to have addressed that. It should have been a chance to remind that mom in Rifle that our government or at least someone in our government understands the struggles she faces and has the capacity and the will to help to do something about it. This bill squanders that opportunity. This tax bill squanders it. Worse than that, it reminds Americans of the vast space between their lives and the priorities in It reminds them of the yawning gap between their voices and the voices of powerful special interests.  We should reject this bill. It fails on the merits. We should reject it because the bill makes a mockery of how our government should work. There is still time to set aside this legislation and do bipartisan tax reform. I know the other side may believe that it has to forge ahead for a political win, but I would ask, at what cost?  As with so many actions around here, we have put it on the next generation of We have kicked all the hard choices to them ever since I have been here. We have told them that we are going to continue to live in the house of our democratic Republic but that they are going to pay the mortgage. We are so fortunate that our parents and grandparents didn't behave the way we have--they had the decency to look ahead and think of those to come. We have enjoyed years of peace and prosperity in this incredible country. I think, tonight and this week, it is worth all of our asking, will our children be able to say the same of us?

116,topic-id,799,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Gaetz) for leading this Special Order tonight, and I am grateful for his work on this very important issue.  Mr.Speaker, I will tell you that I am very appreciative of my colleagues who also continue to work on this very important task, because this reminds me of playing a basketball game where you get there and there is a five-on-five game, except for it is not really five-on-five because the other team has got the referees on their side, they have got the scorekeeper on their side, they have got the statistics on their side, they have got the person that runs the clock on their side.  That is really what has happened here. We know that is what has happened here because of the conflict of interest and bias that has taken over and controls the Robert Mueller special investigations team. That is a team that is biased. He has got conflict of interest. Nobody is going to get a fair shake from that team.  Why is that?  Well, let's just think about this. A couple of weeks ago, we had the FBI--excuse me--Attorney General Jeff Sessions come in. He is a great guy. I asked him specifically: Do you have any procedure to vet conflict of interest or bias on Mueller's special team or in the Department of Justice?  He said: No, we don't. We don't have that.  He doesn't have a question there. He doesn't have a process. He says: It is up to each individual to determine if they have got that conflict of interest or bias.  Well, we had Director Wray in last week. I asked him the same question. He said basically the same thing: No, we don't have a process.  Mueller doesn't have a process. In fact, it is as if the process is you need to have a conflict or bias in order to get on Mueller's special counsel team. That is what this is stacked up to be.  Well, that is where we are today. And tomorrow, when Deputy Rosenstein comes in, I am looking forward to asking him the same questions because there is conflict and there is bias. My colleagues have all iterated that tonight. It just happens over and over and over again. To get on that team, you have to have a conflict or bias.  Well, so what else is important? What else has come out of these hearings?  Well, I tell you what else has come out. I said to Director Wray: Look, we know there is a problem here. Attorney General Sessions told us that the responsibility of the person involved is to make sure they don't have a conflict. We know that there is a huge cloud that sits right there.  Well, this is outrageous. No firm in the private sector would ever allow that to go on. But here we have this--it is like a drip, drip, drip from a faucet. Every day or two, here is another conflict of interest that comes out. Maybe Mr.Strzok, maybe Mr.Ohr, maybe Mr.Ohr's wife, maybe Mr.Weissmann, maybe Mr.Zebley, maybe Mr.Cooper, maybe Jeannie It just goes on and on.  You know what? This is ridiculous. So I asked Director Wray: Look, you have got the inspector general looking at the Hillary Clinton investigation right now and all these other investigations. What will you do if he says there was irregularities in the Hillary Clinton investigation?  He said: I would try to ``unring the bell.''  Think about that. He says he is willing to unring the bell. I asked him what he meant. So he talked about personnel decisions. Maybe someone needs to be let go, disciplined, retrained, whatever. Maybe they will come up with a process to vet conflicts of interest and bias investigations.  But I pressed him a little bit harder. I asked him: When you get to unring the bell, if you have irregularities in the Hillary Clinton investigation, will you commit to reopen the investigation?  Now, he didn't commit, but he indicated very strongly he would reopen that Hillary Clinton investigation.  That is what needs to happen now. We know that there were irregularities. We know that that is what the inspector general is going to find. And I tell you this: We have got to stop making this administration play a stacked team when the other team has nothing but biased and conflicted investigators who control the clock, who control the score, who control the statistics, who control the referees. That is what you have going on here, and it must stop, and it must stop now.  With that in mind, if Attorney General Sessions, if Director Wray, and if Mr.Rosenstein do not provide the information Congress has asked, they should be held in contempt.

510,topic-id,658,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy, and I appreciate her advocacy on this.  This is serious business. There are people--no secret--in the administration and there are people in Congress who would like to undermine this agreement. The mixed signals that have been sent by the administration are truly disturbing.  One has to wonder what North Korea is thinking about, that there are people who suggest that we ought to go ahead and blow it up when, in fact, they are abiding by the terms of the agreement, and officials in the administration agree with this. What sort of deterrent is that to North Korea in terms of its reckless action with nuclear weapons? It seems to reinforce that behavior.  But there are also elements in Iran, hardliners who didn't agree with this agreement, who felt that it was too evenhanded, who felt that the leadership gave up too much, and who don't want closer relationships with the United States or the other Western powers that worked with us--including China and Russia--to enact this historic agreement, which, as I pointed out, was agreed to even by officials in the Trump administration that Iran has abided by.  Are they a nation of bad actors? There are forces within the government that are very destructive. But the point is we focused on something that all of us agree is absolutely critical, and that is not having Iran rushing forward to become another nuclear state. We have seen that the breakout time under this agreement has lengthened. It is acting as we intended.  It was also one of those rare areas where we actually had Germany, Great Britain, France, Russia, and China working with us to negotiate an agreement.  Now, this is going to be perceived as an effort by the United States to undermine the agreement. Should we give them and the hardliners in Iran an excuse to walk away because we violated it? What is going to be the assessment of our allies who are deeply committed to this and have resisted efforts to unravel it?  We need all the help we can get in the international arena. We have watched this administration systematically isolate us, this last week with the reckless decision to go ahead and relocate the Embassy--or at least claim we are going to relocate the Embassy--condemned by virtually everybody else in the world. We are standing alone with an action to destabilize a very volatile situation.  This comes forward at a time when Iran is abiding by it, to go ahead and crank up the report on the assets of a variety of Iran's senior political, religious, and military leaders, including people who aren't subject to the sanctions.  It is placing, it has been mentioned, strain on the Department that has finite resources--it needs to focus on things--taking away resources from efforts to target on actual sanctionability. It seems to be decidedly wrongheaded.  It is interesting that Congress had until this week to reimpose the sanction lifted under the agreement per Trump's decertification in Congress chose not to. I think that was a wise decision. To me, it indicates, at least, that the agreement has been largely successful.  But, if we are going to jeopardize the framework, giving the hardline elements an opportunity to claim that we are repudiating, while giving a green light to some of the folks there who have no intention of being able to work on a cooperative basis, we ought not to fan the flames. We ought to be trying to nurture opportunities for cooperation.  We should focus on areas where they are doing things we don't agree with. If you want to target some specific sanctions that we somehow haven't imposed that are within the purview of the framework and wouldn't violate it, go ahead. But having these actions, I think, sends the wrong signal. It is the wrong resource.  Mr.Chairman, I think it is important to reject this legislation.

746,topic-id,673,"Mr.Speaker, by now, enough of the harsh reality of the Republican tax plan has been discovered by That is why most are opposed. They oppose a huge transfer of wealth to those who don't need it from the majority of middle class Americans who do need help.  They are against giving hundreds of billions of dollars to the largest corporations and the richest Americans with increased borrowing on our children and grandchildren. Their proposal would cost about $2.3 trillion in increased debt and interest.  They are raising taxes on almost 9 million middle-income people with very high medical bills. The Alzheimer's tax is a bad idea and people hate it.  People noticed that the huge permanent tax breaks for businesses and the wealthy--they have got theirs--but the tax relief for middle-income Americans is temporary and will disappear over time.  By 2023, the average American who makes $30,000 a year or less will see a tax increase. By 2027, all tax brackets under $75,000 are going to see a tax increase. Because the Republicans will change the way that tax brackets are adjusted for inflation, we are going to see people pulled up into ever higher tax rates--a stealth tax increase. For middle class Americans, their tax relief is a political football while the rich and the powerful are protected.  Of course, there are other strange things that are going to come out on an ongoing basis because of the crazy way this has been put together, and it is still being massaged behind the scenes. For example, we found just last weekend that some professionals who make between $500,000 and $650,000 a year are going to pay a marginal tax rate of over 100 percent. For that extra $100 they make, they are going to pay $107 in taxes. Absolutely insane.  People are noticing that this proposal is triggering spending cuts for Medicare--$25 billion scheduled for next year--and Medicaid cuts for the elderly and disabled are on the horizon.  There are more reasons to oppose this proposal than I have time to list here this morning, but perhaps the most fundamental flaw has not been given nearly enough attention. The Republicans would change taxation based on how you make your money, not how much you make.  The very highest taxes will be on the way that 80 percent of Americans make their income. W-2 salary and wages are going to pay the highest rate. It is going to be collected on each paycheck and very hard to cut corners.  This is going to open a whole new industry when people find that a CPA who works for a corporation making exactly the same money as somebody who is an independent professional doing exactly the same job but pays far more in taxes, people are going to cash in on a whole new industry in terms of how people can change how their income is characterized.  There will be a professional corporation, a passthrough business, a proprietor, partnerships, and closely held corporations. They will all be treated differently based on ownership, the day-to-day level of involvement, and the organizational structure. In short, all the people who employ lobbyists are going to be able to find a way to pay a lower tax rate than people who just get a paycheck for salary and wages.  Since when does reform of the tax system take this perverted form?  In fact, those people who are going to be changing the form to those other structures will be able to deduct, as corporations will, their State and local property taxes, but individuals will not. It is unfair and it is unwise. This massive transfer of wealth to the people who need it the least, financed by our children and grandchildren with higher debt, and creating a different class of taxpayer based not on how much you make but how clever you are to be able to utilize differences that are created by the army of lobbyists who are at work here on Capitol It should be rejected.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgH9792.txt,99,PROMOTING CLOSED-LOOP PUMPED STORAGE HYDROPOWER ACT,2017.0,12.0,December

715,topic-id,1177,"Mr.President, I am willing to wager that the term ``net neutrality'' has no meaning to many It is a term that refers to a practice and a set of rules that are likely a total mystery to the vast majority of the people who are affected by them. As often happens in Washington, DC, the terms of art are highly technical and obtuse and obscure, but the effects of these rules matter to almost every American, openly, and they will be of increasing importance to Americans if the current net neutrality rules are reversed tomorrow.  That is why I am here. The Federal Communications Commission, under the leadership of its new Chairman, Ajit Pai, has a reckless and needless plan to repeal those rules that are vital to a level playing field and fair access to consumers of the internet content that they value and need. To put it very simply, Chairman Pai's plan would disastrously disadvantage small businesses. It would harm our economy. It would threaten the internet's incredible success, including innovation. It would harm consumers by giving them higher prices and possibly lower speeds in accessing what they want from the internet.  The background here is pretty simple. In 2015, the FCC adopted its open internet order to preserve the open nature of the internet. The internet has thrived on its openness. That is, in a sense, its spirit and its great advantage. It is uniquely American in that way--open and accessible.  The order created three very bright line rules: no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization. Nobody could stop access or block it. Nobody could diminish the availability--no throttling and no paid authorization. That is to say that nobody is to get a benefit from faster speeds simply because he is paying more. Those rules really put the internet at stake--the vitality and innovative energy is at stake here.  Blocked sites, slower speeds, fast lanes and slow lanes, and more fees will[[Page S7994]]be our future on the internet if these rules are revoked, as Chairman Pai says they will be tomorrow. Some of today's internet service providers will benefit. They already have clear conflicts of interest. They own content companies. They want their customers to spend more time on their content. Comcast, for example, owns the media giant Verizon owns Yahoo and  We are having a hearing this afternoon that involves Comcast and NBCUniversal, and I am deeply troubled by the expiration of the conditions that have been put on the merger. Those conditions help to protect competition and consumers. They have a questionable effect in that purpose, but even the modest comfort or protection they provide will completely evaporate as the conditions expire. So I will ask today that there be an investigation by the Department of Justice to sustain and continue those conditions and ask that the court that approved them actually extend them to meet the needs of competition and consumers.  Our current net neutrality rules prevent companies from becoming gatekeepers, toll takers, in a way that favors their own content. If they are the gatekeepers and the toll takers, they are the ones who block, and they are the ones who collect the fees. If they have the ability to pick and choose between the content providers that belong to their competitors or the content providers that are independent, they are going to choose their own content providers. They are going to favor their own over the others. Gutting the net neutrality rules, in effect, gives them free rein to favor their own content and their own political views.  If the internet service providers are able to block content or charge higher fees for access, eventually the ones who will suffer will be the consumers. They will pay higher prices, or the content will be slowed in reaching them. Make no mistake. Companies that are willing to pay the toll for fast lanes will transfer those costs to consumers. They are not going to just absorb the additional expense. The folks who have no idea what the term ``net neutrality'' means--who may have never heard it--are the ones who are going to pay the freight. They are going to be the ones who suffer the consequences.  These rules are for a reason. They were not simply picked out of the air. They are not some product of some overactive regulatory imagination. They have meaning and consequence for ordinary people who use the internet, which is one of the economic giants of our generation. We are, in effect, throttling, blocking, and raising prices for the people who depend on innovation and access and openness.  The right thing for Chairman Pai to do is to cancel tomorrow's party-line vote and abandon this misguided plan to destroy the free and open internet. He is acting, in essence, at the behest of the economic giants--the cable companies--that stand to benefit because they will raise prices and favor their own content.  No matter what he decides, the fight is only really beginning. We will no doubt bring legislation to the U.Senate--not an easy task to pass it. Any final action in the FCC unquestionably, undoubtedly, will be challenged in the courts. I am actually hopeful that we can avoid litigation. Litigation is always a last resort. But there will be litigation because the 2015 open internet order was actually based on 10 years of evidence in a fact-based docket. Again, it was not pulled out of the air; it was based on factfinding and thought and redrafting that then, in fact, resulted in litigation that was upheld in the courts. In fact, in the court of appeals, it was judged to be legal and rationally rooted in real fact. That is the internet order that should be sustained.  I hope that Chairman Pai will postpone this misguided plan. I hope that he will abandon it. There is no need to recklessly repeal the net neutrality rules without demonstrating a significant and substantial change in factual circumstances. That is what is required statutorily--a significant and substantial change in factual circumstances to justify revoking and repealing a rule that was based on circumstance and fact.  In the meantime, millions of Americans have already given their opinions. They have weighed in. They have said to the FCC: Stop playing with the internet in a way that favors the big guys--the cable companies--the ones who will block or throttle and raise prices.  We should not allow Chairman Pai to silence their comments, to ignore them, or disregard them.  The FCC has a responsibility here. It is a public trust. It matters to the millions of Americans who have never heard and will probably never hear that term ``net neutrality'' and who will never understand what its consequences are until they see them personally, up close, firsthand--higher prices, blocking, throttling. That is the evil we can and must avoid.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

871,topic-id,1898,"Mr.President, I am honored to join my colleagues on the floor today, and I want to thank our great and distinguished leader on this issue, Senator Durbin, who has devoted so many years and so much energy and has been a model for me personally of what an advocate should be in the Senate and most especially on this issue, which has been preeminently important to me since my arrival here almost 7 years ago.  For a time, I was on the floor almost every week, periodically, with a photo of another Dreamer, and the reason was to make this issue real in the hearts of the American people, to bring their voices and faces to this body.  Today, I am joined in spirit by Alejandra She is one of 8,000 Dreamers in I am proud of each and every one of them. She is one of 700,000 Dreamers in the United States of America, and I hope that my colleagues are proud of them in their States, as well, because they are absolutely incredible people. Nobody's perfect, but in many ways, they embody the spirit and values of They work hard. They go to school. They are future engineers, scientists, nurses, and doctors. They are of immense value to our economy because they work and contribute, and they will better themselves through education, through their values. And they know what it means to be an American citizen. Even though they are not, they know the value of citizenship.  Alejandra came to this country when she was 1 year old. She was brought here by her parents, across the border from Her family lived in a cramped, small house with her two uncles. They had very little money. She and her sister were bullied by students in elementary school because, of course, they had to learn They spoke with an accent. She told me: ``My mother told me not to give up.'' That is what she wrote me a couple of days after the President of the United States announced that he would end the DACA She wrote me 5 days after the Trump administration rescinded DACA, and her story has stuck with me, haunted me over these months, just as when I have met with Dreamers--as I did just this past Monday in Hartford, CT--to reassure them that I was going to fight every day that we have remaining in this session, their stories have haunted and moved and inspired me.  Alejandra was bullied, but even as she was bullied for speaking a different language--her native language--and learning English, even as her father was deported, even as her family was left without him and with even less support, they persevered.  She wrote to me: ``I made it my mission to prove that I was worthy of being considered an American.'' How many of us, growing up, made it our mission to prove ourselves worthy of being an American? I daresay few of us considered that mission. Most of us take for granted that we are Americans, that we are citizens of the greatest country in the history of the world.  Slowly but surely she learned English, and it became her primary language. In 2012, she got a break: The Obama administration enacted She could come out of the shadows. She could have a place, some security. That step unlocked for her--literally unlocked for her--the American dream.  For all of us who take for granted what it means to be an American, who have never made it a mission to become an American, we often take for granted the American dream. Well, we belong here. No one is going to send us away. No one is going to deport us to a land we have no knowledge of, to a place away from our friends and our families. But DACA meant something else as well, more than just emotional; it meant that she could go to college, and she did. She went to Wesley, where she is now a student. For once, she had the immense luxury of not being afraid. She could go to college and study--as she is now studying--film and international relations. She felt empowered to speak up and participate in her community.  She worked at Delaware Goes to College Academy and the Summer Learning They both promote education for disadvantaged youth. She was now not only learning and studying at one of the great universities in our country but giving back to others, enabling others to climb that same ladder, young people with disadvantages like hers to make the most of themselves and to achieve that American dream.  When Attorney General Sessions, with the President's approval, rescinded DACA in September, Alejandra wrote to me:       I wanted this to be my country so badly. One thing that I      knew from the bottom of my heart was that I wanted to stay      here, and that I was an  Anyone who looks at Alejandra, knows her story, and hears her words has to be heartbroken that a young woman seeking so deeply to be an American, to live the American dream and American values, to give back to this country that she loves, and never to take for granted what so many of us do--we have to be heartbroken to hear those words and her story.  I have heard my colleagues say: Well, why now? Why not wait until after the new year? Why not wait until March? Why not wait? Waiting until March would mean an extension of her anxiety, apprehension, and fear. It would also mean the extension of a humanitarian crisis.  Make no mistake, for 8,000 young people in Connecticut and 700,000 in the United States of America, threatening deportation to them is an unprecedented message to the world and to ourselves. It says something about who we are. To leave them hanging is not only unfair, it is unworthy of us as  More practically speaking, tens of thousands of DACA recipients are estimated to have already lost their protection from removal. Kicking the can down the road would mean continued anguish for those 700,000 young people, and it would mean breaking a promise. They came forward. They provided their addresses, their cell phone numbers, their tax information on the promise that it would not be used against them.  It would mean instability in the job market, and it would hurt our economy. That is why employers are coming forward and urging us to act now. Companies have been forced to consider whether they should fire DACA recipients and train new employees in anticipation of the March deadline. It would churn and create turmoil if we fail to act. In fact, it already is creating chaos and confusion because[[Page S7972]]looming on the horizon ominously, inextricably, is the threat of mass deportation.  It would be a humanitarian nightmare, and it is a bureaucratic nightmare, as well, to wait. If the Dream Act is passed, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has work to do. They need to develop new regulations, process applications. This involves conducting security checks, biometric screening, notifying the applicants, and doing the paperwork. Experts say that this process could take up to 7 months in total. So we are already late. We are already late in beginning and accomplishing this task.  If we delay our action, thousands of Dreamers will lose their protections before the law is fully implemented. Young, contributing members of our society--like Alejandra--who have done nothing wrong will be dragged back into the shadows, to lose their drivers licenses, to lose their jobs, to lose their sense of security, to fear every day the sound of police sirens, as so many do right now.  The administration has literally thrown a timebomb to this body, and it is ticking. We have the power to diffuse it. We have the power to do the right thing. We have the power and we have the obligation to truly give those 700,000 Dreamers the ability to make the most of themselves and make the most of this country.  Often, when I think of the Dreamers, I think of my father, who came to this country in 1935. He was 17 years old. He knew virtually no one. He spoke almost no He had not much more than the shirt on his back, and he was a Dreamer, although he came here legally. He became a U.citizen. Nobody loved this country more than my dad.  I sometimes think how sad and ashamed he would be about the way we have denied Dreamers the opportunity and security that he felt coming here, escaping persecution in This country has never been perfect, but we are the greatest country in the history of the world because we are a nation of immigrants.  If you are ever discouraged or down about your lives or about the country, you may want to try going to the immigration naturalization ceremonies in your They happen in Connecticut every week in courthouses. I go as often as I can on Fridays, when they usually occur, in Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport, because it is so uplifting. It is so very inspiring to see people who are moved and grateful beyond words--moved to tears--in becoming citizens of the United  The judges usually give me an opportunity to say a few words, and I thank them for wanting to become citizens. I tell them ``You passed a test that most Americans couldn't pass,'' and they laugh, as perhaps some who are listening now would laugh because they know it is true.  They wanted to become American citizens, so they studied and they prepared. Many of them came long distances, escaping persecution--just as my dad did--and left behind families, loved ones, jobs, careers. They wanted to be citizens. They will never take it for granted, nor will Alejandra if she is given that opportunity. She wants it too. She is a Dreamer, not only in name but in spirit. I hope all of us keep her in mind and in heart when we think about what we are going to do in the next couple of weeks.  As for me, I am determined that we should not leave here for our holiday without acting on this measure. I know we can do it if both sides of the aisle are reasonable, responsible, and responsive. The vast majority of the American people are with They know her as a neighbor; they know her as a friend. Even though they may never have met her, they know people like her who are in their communities, and they know the immense contribution that she and others like her can make.  I know so many of them who share that simple goal to become a U.citizen, and it begins with permanent status, a path--a path to earn citizenship. Whatever it may be called, it begins with a sense of security and belonging.  I hope this body will pass the Dream Act and give Alejandra and so many like her that opportunity to accomplish the American dream.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1053,topic-id,2083,"Mr.President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from New York, our minority leader, for his very powerful and eloquent remarks on net neutrality. He has been a leader in protecting consumers in so many areas, and this one is preeminently important.  We are here on a day when the FCC may well repeal the net neutrality order. I spoke at length about it yesterday, and I am struck by the mockery that the FCC will make of consumer protection if it proceeds with this very misguided and mistaken course. It is a course that will be reversed, I believe, in the courts if it is followed, and it should be reversed in this body as well. It is profoundly important to the future of the internet to have access and affordability to innovation, to our economy, and to job creation. The open and accessible internet is part of our lifeblood economically and culturally in this country. Part of what makes America great is the freedom of access and innovation.           Fifth Anniversary of the Sandy Hook Mass Shooting  Mr.President, I want to talk today on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre in my State of It was one of the saddest days of my life and one of the worst days of my public career when I went to the elementary school in Newtown, CT, along with a number of my colleagues who will be speaking today as well, Congresswoman Esty and Senator  In the Judiciary Committee, just moments ago, Senator Feinstein circulated a framed copy of the front page of the Daily News of Wednesday, December 15, 2012--5 years ago, almost to the day. That front page has photographs of the 20 beautiful children who were lost in that unspeakable act of terror and horror. They are 20 wonderful human beings who would be 11 years old today. Their great teachers were killed as well.  Having valued and known their parents as friends and fellow advocates in the effort to achieve commonsense legislation against gun violence, I know how deeply that pain is still felt. The healing is far from over. The grief never ends. The prayers and thoughts of mine go every day to the loved ones who lost those children and educators.  Prayers and thoughts are not enough. It never has been after any of these massacres, and it never will be after the mass killings or for the one-by-one deaths in our communities--90 every day in this great country. Gun violence kills 90 people every day, and 150,000 have perished since Sandy  So as we commemorate this awful day, 5 years ago, let us rededicate ourselves to act to honor those victims with action, to honor all those with action. It is never too soon to honor the victims with action.  On that front page of the Daily News, there is a line that says ``New York's Hometown Newspaper.'' New York wasn't the hometown to those Sandy Hook victims, but America felt that Sandy Hook was every town in America, and it is indeed quintessentially an American town, filled with wonderful people who hugged and grieved together that day.  That night, in the Rose of Lima Church, and in the days following, when there were calling hours and funerals, one after the other, it seemed like they would never end. In some ways they have never ended, because those families' losses are still real and urgent. For us the task of honoring those 20 beautiful children and the 6 educators ought to be real and urgent, even more so today than it was then.  That day we prayed in the Rose of Lima I said to the congregation that the whole world is watching. The whole world was watching. The world is watching America to see whether we will act.  We are not the only country with mental health problems. Our rate of mental illness is no greater than any other developed industrial country, but our rate of gun violence is off the charts compared to other countries. There is no excuse for it. There is no rational explanation for it.  As we prayed and grieved then, in the wake of that senseless, horrific tragedy, Congress turned its back. It turned its back on those courageous and strong families who came here in[[Page S8021]]the weeks following, talking to our colleagues, across the aisle and on this side, asking for commonsense measures, background checks. There was a bipartisan measure then to extend background checks and achieve other gun violence prevention measures, which unfortunately failed on this floor to gain enough votes. We had 55, but we needed 60. From the Gallery on that day, someone shouted: ``Shame.''  December 14, 2012, will be forever a stain on our Nation's history. That day will forever be a black mark on the United States of America, but so will the day that those commonsense measures were rejected in this That shame was richly deserved on that day.  Congress saw the photos of those innocent babies, those wonderful children. It saw their grieving parents. It saw the lines of terrified and traumatized children that day being led to safety out of their elementary school. It saw the war zone that the school became when that mass killing turned it into something that no teacher, no educator ever could have foreseen. Those educators helped save lives.  Congress saw and heard the stories of how brave educators sought to shield their children from the bullets coming from that assault weapon on that day. Unfortunately, the vice-like grip of the gun lobby and, principally, the NRA--let's be blunt about who is leading that lobby--prevailed. In the 1,825 days since the Sandy Hook tragedy, despite the 150,000 people who have perished from gun violence since then, Congress has chosen inaction. It has disregarded public safety and the clear will of the American people. It has heeded instead the campaign contributions of the gun lobby, and it has failed to act. It has been complicit in the continuing scourge of gun violence by its inaction. It has been complicit in those deaths. It has been an aider and abettor, in fact, to the 90 killings each day as a result of gun violence. Shame on Congress if it fails to act now.  Today I am not just heartbroken; I am furious. I am angry beyond words about Congress's complicity, about the inaction we have seen, about Congress's abject failure to take commonsense steps that will protect the American people, about its failure to meet this public health crisis with the kind of action that the American people deserve and need. If 90 people every day were perishing from Ebola or some contagious disease--even the flu--there would be an outcry, an outrage, and we would be clamoring to do something.  Here, the solutions are self-evident. None of them is a panacea. None is a single, magic solution to this problem. The trap raised by the gun lobby that none will necessarily deal with the mass killing that just happened is, indeed, a trap we should reject.  The ban on bump stocks might have prevented Las Vegas but not The closing of the 72-hour loophole that permits purchasers to buy a gun if the background check has not been completed in 72 hours might not have prevented Las Vegas, but it would have prevented Dylann Roof purchased the gun only because he was able to circumvent the background check as a result of that 72-hour loophole.  The ban on certain kinds of high capacity magazines might not have prevented San Bernardino or Orlando, but it would have helped to prevent Sandy  We will never know whether any of these measures would prevent every one of the killings that we cite, but each of them can save lives, and if we save one life, we will have saved the world.  Shame on Congress for allowing this tragic anniversary to be followed by so many more--Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, Orlando, Charleston, and each and every day in the news. Every day, none of our communities is immune from this scourge. It is truly a public health crisis.  I am hopeful that there may well be a crack in the united partisan front emerging. I am proud to be part of a very powerful bipartisan alliance involving our colleagues, Senators Scott and Cornyn, across the aisle, as well as Senator Murphy and other Senators on this side of the aisle. I hope we can make modest and crucial improvements to the National Instant Criminal Background Check system.  The NICS system should be fixed. The Fix NICS Act will provide incentives and encourage States to do better reporting. Right now there are immense gaps in reporting in the States and even in the Federal Government, which is why, in fact, perhaps, Sutherland Springs occurred, because of a failure to report by the Air Force a domestic violence conviction by court-martial that would have barred the shooter from lawfully obtaining a weapon, had it been reported accurately.  The Fix NICS bill would ensure that Federal and State authorities comply with existing law and accurately report relevant criminal history records to the background check system. This step is the least we can do, not the most, but it is the bare minimum.  While there is broad support for this modest but significant measure, the Republican leadership in the House is already attempting to sabotage it by linking it and pairing it with the truly dangerous Concealed Carry Reciprocity That act would sabotage the laws of States like Connecticut that seek to protect our citizens. It would, in effect, provide that permits from other States be treated like driver's licenses, no matter how lenient or even nonexistent the provisions may be for obtaining permits in those other It would eviscerate rights of States like Connecticut to protect our citizens with higher standards.  These basic measures to prevent gun violence have no threat whatsoever to gun ownership. They ensure that people who are a danger to themselves or others and convicted criminals and others already barred from buying weapons will not be permitted to carry a lethal firearm.  I respect the Second It is the law of the land. No firearm should be taken away from law-abiding citizens. But the idea that there is nothing Congress can do to make a difference and save American lives is unacceptable and false. It is a political copout resoundingly rejected by the vast majority of  Ninety-five percent of Americans want background checks applied to all purchases. They overwhelmingly favor fixes to the present background check system that make the oversight of purchases more accurate, and they favor commonsense measures that will protect innocent human beings like the 20 beautiful children and sixth grade educators lost that day in Sandy  When I feel most discouraged and disgusted, I think of those families. I think of the parents of Olivia Engel, and I think of the parents of all of those beautiful children and wonder, as I am sure they often do, what lives they would be leading today. What would Olivia Engel be doing on this day filled with Sun and beauty? In Connecticut, this morning, it snowed. At 6 or 11, snow would still be a wonderful thing, never to be taken for granted by any child. This holiday--all of the wonder and beauty of this holiday--is never taken for granted by a 6-year-old or an 11-year old. The possibilities, opportunities, dreams, and hopes were shattered on that day and lost forever.  I was at the calling hours for one of the children killed at Sandy Hook, and it was a gut-wrenching moment--every one of them. I spoke to the mother of one of those children, and I said: When you are ready, we should do something about gun violence.  She said, without hesitation, through reddened eyes and cracking voice: I am ready now. I am ready now.  America should be ready. America is ready. This body should follow America's lead--honor with action. If nothing else is remembered of that day 5 years ago, let us honor with action those strong and courageous families who have suffered this unspeakable horror, this unimaginable grief, and who have come here in years past to ask us to honor with action the victims, survivors, and loved ones of Sandy Hook and of all gun violence horrors in this country.

711,topic-id,1506,"Mr.President, the good news about the tax bill that I believe we will pass over the next few days is that it will go into effect on the first day of January and people will quickly see, no matter how loud others are talking, the exact facts. For work done in January, people who get that check in January or February or whenever they get paid for their January work--there is going to be a substantial tax decrease for working families at all levels. Our friends want to talk about what happens after 2025 or 2027, but surely the Congress can do its job between now and then.  This is a pro-growth policy. There are two ways to increase people's take-home pay, and we are going to pursue both of them. One is to take less out of your pay right now. That will happen not a year from now and not a year and a half from now; that will happen next month. So next month, when people get their paychecks, it will be clear to them who had the facts and who didn't have the facts on this. The second way it will increase people's pay is by having better jobs to start with. Hundreds of economists who have looked at this bill say that it will make the United States of America the best place to invest money and create jobs, and I think we will know sooner rather than later that that happens.  So good tax policy, commonsense regulation, and judges--another thing we are working on this week--make a difference in how people look at the economy that they want to invest in and an economy that they want to grow. Why would judges make a difference? Judges make a difference because judges create a sense of fairness in the court. They create a sense of an ability to get your case heard. And they create a sense that what the law says hopefully is what the judge will decide rather than what the judge thinks the law should say.  We are making great progress in all of those areas if we add good tax policy to what has been happening.  Right now, Mr.President, we are talking about judges, and President Trump has a unique opportunity to shape the long-term view of the judiciary. This week we are going to confirm three circuit judges, and I wish to speak in just a little while about what that means.  At the start of President Trump's term, 12 percent of all of the Federal judiciary seats were vacant. No President has had that kind of opportunity[[Page S7991]]since President Clinton had that opportunity now almost 25 years ago when he started his first year. And the President will have the opportunity--and is making the most of it--to fill those vacancies.  I believe President Trump made the right choice when he selected Justice Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme There was a record as a circuit judge; you can look at what he had decided. The Presiding Officer and I and other Members of the Senate can look at what he has decided and anticipate, after 10 years of that record, what his record would look like. It makes a difference. I have no doubt that President Trump will continue to nominate judges who will rule as did Justice Scalia, whose unfortunate death created the most recent vacancy.  Justice Scalia, by the way, served on the Supreme Court for 26 years after the person who nominated him left the White House and 13 years after President Reagan died. So the legacy of what happens here is important.  Justice Scalia was profound in his sense that the work of the Court was not to decide what the legislature should have done; the work of the Court was to decide what the law and the Constitution said. There are ways to change the law, and there are ways to amend the Constitution, but a person on the Court needs to look at what the Constitution and the laws say.  While Supreme Court vacancies tend to get a lot of attention, it is just as important that the Senate nominate and confirm the jobs the President and the Senate share. It is our responsibility too.  The Constitution could have said: Will report to the Senate, and, unless there is some big objection, that person becomes a judge. That is not what it says. It says: The Senate will confirm.  As of this morning, there are slightly more than 140 lifetime vacancies on the courts to be filled. So far this year, we have confirmed 10 circuit court judges. By the time we leave this week, I think we will have confirmed 12 circuit judges this year. That will be close to a post-World War II record. It has been a long time since World War II, and it has been a long time since a President has had the opportunity to do that.  Why do we need to do that? First of all, the people of this country have a right to seek justice and to believe that the rule of law will prevail. The Supreme Court hears about 100 to maybe 150 cases in a year, but the 12 circuit courts--where you appeal a lower Federal court ruling to--hear many cases, and about 7,000 of those cases are appealed to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court deals with 100 to 150 of them. So the judges in the 12 circuits often write what, in our structure, is essentially final law; the final rule of any court is at the circuit level.  The Federal Bar Association says that the ``number of federal judicial vacancies throughout the federal court system is straining the capacity of the federal courts to [do their job].''  In cooperation with the President, we have a job to do here. The capacity to hear these cases is important. Justice delayed is justice denied.  Filling these vacancies is also critical to ensuring that the balance of the Constitution is in place. This was a brandnew idea when James Madison and others thought of putting a machine together. They sometimes referred to the Constitution as the instrument that would be the guideline for a machine--a machine that was so finely balanced that it would govern itself.  The courts--the judiciary--the legislative branch, and the executive branch all have unique powers, and those unique powers were designed to keep the government in check. This concept, new in 1787, has worked well for us, but it doesn't work if one of the groups is allowed to become out of balance. So filling these vacancies matters.  The leadership of the majority leader and the leadership of Chairman Grassley in his committee make a difference. As we move forward with the confirmation process for three more nominees this week, we are advancing our goal of restoring the courts to judges who will determine what the law says, not what they think it should say.  I urge my colleagues to support these well-qualified nominees. But I also urge my colleagues on the other side to stop using the process to frustrate the other work of the government. There is a right to 30 hours of debate, which is what we are in right now; we are in 30 hours of debate on a circuit judge, but nobody is talking about that circuit judge. Other bills could have been brought to the floor, and other issues that could have been dealt with aren't being dealt with because the minority has decided to abuse their power--to say that we are going to have 30 hours of debate about this judicial nominee, and then have no debate about the judicial nominee.  It doesn't mean we don't need to confirm the judges, but it does mean, if we did so in a way that made sense for the people we work for, we would be doing other business now, and these three judges would have already been confirmed. They will be confirmed this week.  My belief is that if the rules designed to protect the minority in the Senate are abused, they will not last forever. Eventually, you have to say: OK, facts are facts. This rule isn't being used this way, and the Senate has to do the people's work. If rules have to be changed to do that, I am for changing those rules.

870,topic-id,1500,"Mr.President, I want to thank all my colleagues who have spoken today. I really want to thank Senator Durbin, who has been a friend and a mentor of mine since I came to the Senate almost exactly 4 years ago. I thank him for his leadership right now--really leading us on both sides of the aisle, as a central focal point for the Dreamers--and for his words. I thank him for his leadership today and throughout this effort, making sure we don't leave for the holidays, leaving thousands of children in our country who know no other country--young adults--in a purgatory where they are anxiously waiting to see if this body will act.  This is a time where we have seen incredible activism. I cannot tell you how many times I have been stopped by Dreamers who drove for over 24 hours--drove across this country to come to the Capitol to make their case known. They love this country. They serve this country. They only know this country. They were here before they could even speak. They and their fellow American allies have been struggling and toiling and fighting for recognition. It reminds me of generations of Americans in the past who were fighting and toiling and struggling for recognition as citizens when citizenship was denied them.  I know stories from my own family, African Americans, who, literally, like many of these Dreamers--900 of these Dreamers--have served in the military. I know these stories from my family--people who served in war, served in World War II, served in Korea, like my father, and came back to a country that did not recognize their citizenship rights.  Women, Jews, Irish--so much of the story of America is Americans struggling and toiling and fighting, often coming to the Capital of the United States of America, fighting for recognition of their citizenship rights. They are patriots.  The young people I have encountered in my home State and the young people I have encountered here in the Capitol are patriots. Patriotism is love of country. I am one of these folks who believe that love of country is better seen than heard. I am telling you right now, the Dreamers I have encountered, their service, their sacrifice, their contributions to this country should resonate.  We know the data. Billions of dollars of our economy is being fueled by Dreamers who are here serving in every imaginable capacity--there for their neighbors, there for their community, there for other children, there for  I sat across from Dreamers in New Jersey who now, because of the inaction here in Washington, because of the uncertainty, these folks--for whom we have collectively contributed to their education, contributed to their success, and are enjoying the fruits of their success--are now suddenly withdrawing from schools. They are feeling nervous that they are going to be ripped away from family members--younger siblings who are already recognized citizens--as they fight for their citizenship rights. I have seen the pain. I have seen the anxiety. I have shared the tears as they continue this fight, hoping this body will act.  There are folks like She is a Dreamer from Ridgefield, She literally created a startup business that employs over 800 people. She is a job creator, an entrepreneur, an innovator whom people rely on for their jobs, and we are going to turn around and say to Liz: You have to leave the United States of America, the only country you know.  What about people like Jesus Contreras? He was the paramedic from Houston who worked for 6 straight days, pulling all-nighter after all-nighter after Hurricane Harvey hit. Here is a guy who, when we faced a crisis and people's lives were on the line, stepped up. That is patriotism. That is love of country. You can't love your country unless you love your country men and women. The way you show you love your country men and women isn't just through the songs you sing and the pledges you make, it is the actions you take. In a crisis, he was there reaching out to American hands with his hand that is worthy.  Dreamers have been a gift to this They are hard-working patriots deserving of our respect. They come from a long tradition of people who have served this country, fought for this country, struggled for this country, who battled for respect from this country. They look up and say: I, too, am an Don't judge me by a piece of paper that says so. Look at my deeds. Look at my actions. Look at my life.  This, our wealth; this, our natural resource; the genius created in the image of God; we are going to cast these folks out of our Nation, and for what?  I believe that the opposite of justice is not injustice; it is inaction. It is indifference. It is apathy. This body has not acted. It has not shown a level of compassion to patriots. It has rewarded the service of these Dreamers and the sacrifice of these Dreamers with nothing but silence and inaction.  As other days before it, today I am glad that I stand with colleagues who will not be silent. This tradition in our country of solid citizens, of patriots who fought, who loved, who contributed to this country, this tradition that runs deep in my family, that runs deep in the families of so many here--when they were told they were not citizens, did not have equal rights--from suffragettes to civil rights activists--this body finally got it right and finally responded.  This is the dream of These young people are called This is the dream of  There was a man who talked about being denied his citizenship rights and who wrote a powerful poem that is as appropriate today as it was when he wrote it. His name is Langston As these Dreamers struggle to be recognized for what they are--citizens of this country--as they put forth a dream that is no more precious or no more worthy than the dreams of my family, of your family, may the words of Langston Hughes speak to our spirits and our souls and motivate us. Langston said:     There is a dream in the land     With its back against the wall     By muddled names and strange     Sometimes the dream is called.     There are those who claim     This dream for theirs alone--     A sin for which we know     They must atone.     Unless shared in common     Like sunlight and like air,     The dream will die for lack     Of substance anywhere.     The dream knows no frontier or tongue,     The dream, no class or race.     The dream cannot be kept secure     In any one locked place.     This dream today embattled,     With its back against the wall--     To save the dream for one     It must be saved for all.  Mr.President, I tell you this with all of my heart: I have met these young[[Page S7971]]I have seen their service. I know their sacrifice. They have worn our uniforms, from our military uniforms to the uniforms of first responders. They have taught our children. They have benefited from our public schools--from our kindergartens, to our eighth grades, to our high schools, to our colleges, and to our universities. We have invested in them, and that investment is paying dividends. They are the American dream. They represent the best of who we are and who we aspire to be.  They collectively, with the other young people of this Nation, are our greatest hope for the future. If we cast them out, if we send them into the wildernesses of lands that are strange to them, to places where some of them don't even speak the tongue, it will be a sad day, a tragic day for them but even more so for us.  What does it say about a nation that turns its children away for no other reason than they came here when they were 2 or 3 and weren't born here? We are better than this. We are greater than this. Our Nation's ideals are loftier than this.  So in the same spirit that this body was slow to move to grant full citizenship rights to enslaved people, in the same way that this body was slow to move to finally grant citizenship rights to every woman in our country, and in the same spirit that this body was slow to move to grant full citizenship rights and voting rights and civil rights to African Americans, I hope we may summon in this generation, in a cause that is noble, the courage to do the right thing and not be stuck in inaction.  It is time for us to act as a body. It is time for us to recognize the full citizenship rights of those who have proven themselves already through the greatest actions one can do--service to another, service to our country, service to the ideals that we have.

You know, we had three State capitals: Kaskaskia, Vandalia, and We have three State seals. A lot of people don't know that.  If you know Illinois well, you know that there is three distinct parts of Illinois involved. Whether you are in politics or business, it is always referred to as Cook County, the Collar counties, and southern In southern Illinois, we like to capitalize the ``S'' on ``southern.''  There is one other thing that is in threes.

Also, it has John Logan in that mentioning of those three names.  John Logan, if you heard that name before, if you are in D.C., there are many things that are named after Logan, including ``Logan Circle.'' Logan was actually the gentleman who was laid in state--the eighth person laid in state here in this Capitol, and that was because he had established himself from deep southern As a matter of fact, his hometown was--my hometown was his farm, which was subdivided to make that hometown.                              {time}  1945  As a matter of fact, the deed in abstract of the home that I was born and raised in and the house that I later bought from my parents and raised my children for the first 10 years of my marriage in that home, my great-grandmother actually bought that property from his father.

He then became a State representative, then a State senator, then went on to be a Member of the U.Congress and later a U.

They lost, he and He then was running for president and gave a long speech, actually, in the gentleman's hometown who is hosting this tonight, for about 8 hours in the rain, got on a train, came back to the capital here, and passed away with pneumonia.  Another great thing that happened in deep southern Illinois in the Illinois 12th is the Lincoln-Douglas debates. I am blessed to have the only district in the State of Illinois that has two Lincoln-Douglas debate sites.  I am being questioned here that maybe there is one other.

How many of you, as children, remember the cartoon ``Popeye'', who came from Chester, Illinois, in the Illinois 12th?  I am sure many of the other people who speak here tonight, Mr.Speaker, are also proud of their home districts in the State of Illinois, and should be, because I am going to tell you, whether it is from Cairo, to Galena, to Chicago, to Mulkeytown, from Danville, to East Louis, the State of Illinois is a great We love it.  We have good things and bad things that happen, but it has been a great State that has helped this Nation, provided great leaders, provided great people involved in all kinds of fields throughout this Nation and this world.  I have no reservations in saying, and I am sure others would say this about theirs, but I am so blessed, because I live in the most beautiful part of Illinois, the most beautiful part of Illinois where it starts out as the flatlands, what is commonly known as the prairies of Illinois up around Louis and Alton, and it comes south.

32,topic-id,1245,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Paul Compton, which came out of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs I might add that he is President Trump's nominee to serve as general counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban  Mr.Compton is a longtime affordable housing and financial services attorney in the State of Mr.Compton, if confirmed, would bring a deep familiarity with affordable housing to the Office of General That part I like. With 11 million families paying over half their income for rent and with homelessness on the rise for the first time in years, a nominee who appreciates the importance of affordable housing could be a positive addition at Think about that. There are 11 million families who pay more than half their income on rent.  In a book written by Matthew Desmond called ``Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,'' the author said of the people at that income level: When your paycheck comes, the rent eats first. Everything depends on being able to stay in your home and not being foreclosed on. When 11 million people pay over half their income on rent, homelessness is going to be on the rise.  I appreciate Mr.Compton's commitment to me during our Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing that he would look out for the interests of renters and homeowners if confirmed, but I am voting against him because I am concerned about the administration's approach to fair housing protections and the role that he will likely play in helping to carry that out.  I was troubled to learn that Secretary Carson had said that he plans to ``reinterpret'' HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing--or AFFH--rule. Since 1968, the Fair Housing Act has required HUD and its grantees to affirmatively further fair housing. Unfortunately, in the 50 years since our country passed the Fair Housing Act, HUD has not provided enough direction to help communities meet this goal.  A 2010 General Accountability Office report recommended that HUD improve its processes for meeting its obligations to affirmatively further fair housing. In response, HUD developed a revised rule to finally help local governments across the country support and foster fair housing policies throughout their communities.  The rule gives clearer guidance to communities to help them think in new ways about how to create housing opportunities for all of their residents regardless of race or religion or disability or the size of their family. The rule helps them to assess their own fair housing needs, and it provides them publicly available data with which to inform their decisions while they set their own goals and timelines.  Since its adoption 2-plus years ago, HUD has been working with communities to implement the new guidelines. That is the good news. The bad news is that the Secretary has said that he wants to reinterpret, but he is not elaborating on what he meant by his plan to reinterpret the rule. If the Secretary intends to reinterpret the rule in a way that undermines HUD's efforts to help communities fulfill their longstanding obligations under this 50-year-old law, Mr.Compton will be called upon to carry out this vision.  I voted against his nomination in committee because of my concern that he could help guide administration efforts to reverse progress on this fair housing rule. More recent activities by administration officials have only heightened the concerns that many of us have about their approaches to fair housing.  In 2013, HUD issued its discriminatory effects rule. This rule formalized HUD's longstanding prohibition against practices with discriminatory effects under the Fair Housing Act and provided uniform guidance for applying standards across the country.  Because homeowners' insurance is central to the ability to obtain housing, HUD and the courts have held for decades that the Fair Housing Act applies to discriminatory practices in insurance--a very easy-to-understand, logical step. Nevertheless, insurance industry representatives sued to block HUD's application of the discriminatory effects rule--also known as disparate impact--to their industry. HUD and the Department of Justice have been fighting this suit ever since. As general counsel, Mr.Compton would guide HUD's enforcement and litigation strategy.  In response to a written question, Mr.Compton declined to provide his views on the discriminatory effects rule and whether it should apply to the insurance industry. He noted that ``it would be inappropriate'' for him to comment on the matter given the pending litigation.  The administration, it seems, does not share his reluctance to comment on pending litigation. A month and a half ago, the Treasury Department issued a report entitled ``A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities--Asset Management and Insurance.'' In this report, Treasury recommends that HUD reconsider the use of the disparate impact rule.  It is not that this administration decides to support the side of big insurance companies every time--maybe it doesn't every time--but it seems like it almost always does. It did it in this case. Yet Mr.Compton thinks that he shouldn't comment when other already confirmed Trump appointees have. The Treasury's report sides with arguments that have been made by the insurance industry despite the fact that litigation is pending, and HUD and the Department of Justice, at least until now, have been defending the rule. The next court date for the suit is scheduled for later this week.  If the administration continues its drive to reconsider fair housing protections that are opposed to by industry, Mr.Compton will likely be called upon to help the administration in its efforts. Because he declined to answer my question, we don't know what his thinking will be.  While I might be inclined to give Mr.Compton the benefit of the doubt, we have seen too many officials in this administration who are working against the missions of the agencies to which they have been appointed. Financial regulators so often come from Wall Environmental regulators so often come from the chemical industry and the oil industry. We have seen it time and again.  This is happening at a time when we see the administration taking steps to remove protections for average Americans and consumers in order to carry out the bidding of its supporters on Wall These include sending in Mick Mulvaney, who once called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a ``sick, sad joke.'' He is now serving as its It is his moonlighting job, as he is also the Director of the Office of Management and His first act as Director of the CFPB was to block the payments of funds that were owed to consumers--consumers who were cheated or wronged by Wells Fargo and other big banks or big financial institutions. The consumers, in many cases, were servicemembers who had been cheated by these financial institutions. On Mulvaney's first day on the job, he said: No, we are not going to move forward in collecting those penalties and in paying those consumers and those servicemembers and those seniors and those families.  I am concerned about this emerging effort to roll back protections for consumers. I hope that Mr.Compton proves me wrong. I hope that he is a strong advocate within the agency and the administration for fair housing, for consumer protection, and for affordable housing. When given the chance to demonstrate his commitment to fair housing, he took a pass. These matters are too important to far too many Americans for us to leave their futures to chance. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing Mr.Compton's nomination.  I yield the floor.

72,topic-id,3588,"Mr.President, this month, this body has spent much of its time pushing a tax bill that rewards corporations that ship jobs overseas while doing nothing for hard-working families. It has spent time cutting taxes on the wealthiest people in the country--cutting taxes for corporations that ship jobs overseas and giving them more incentives to do it by the way they have actually constructed the bill and rewarding their largest billionaire contributors. At the same time, they have ignored the Children's Health Insurance  Letters are going out to families. There are 200,000 children in my State who are enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Parents in many States are getting letters from[[Page S8014]]the government that read: Sorry, your insurance is going away. Because of the inaction of this body--of Senators and House Members who have insurance provided for by taxpayers--we are not doing our jobs. We get insurance paid for by taxpayers while 200,000 children in Ohio and 60,000, 70,000, 80,000, 90,000, 100,000 families are going to lose theirs. That is it.  We are giving tax cuts to the richest people in the country and tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas instead of fixing the healthcare law, instead of doing the Children's Health Insurance Program--instead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing the things that we should be doing. Forget about what we are not doing to serve the public; the priorities reflected in this tax bill are completely backward, which has become pretty standard in this  Time and again, our economy, our leaders, our politics reward Wall Street, not just instead of workers; we reward Wall Street at the expense of workers. The people of Ohio and people around the country are working harder than ever and working longer than ever, but they have less and less to show for it.  Imagine this: 44 percent of Americans who have an emergency--that would be four out of nine Americans--cannot afford that emergency expense of $400. Four out of every nine Americans cannot come up with $400 to pay for an emergency, but Wall Street is doing just fine. It is getting richer. So what do we do? We give more tax cuts and more tax breaks to corporations that outsource jobs, and we give more help in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee for some of the most profitable banks in Yet we can't do anything for workers, and we can't do anything for families.  The wealth held on Wall Street has gone up. Corporate profits have gone up. CEO salaries have gone up. CEO salaries are 271 times greater than workers' pay. For a worker who makes $20,000--I almost can't even do the math--it is 271 times that. Imagine that. For every $1 a worker makes in the country, the average CEO makes $271. How much do they need? Do you know what the answer to that is? Let's give tax cuts to the people making $271 and maybe a few crumbs for the workers making $1. Is that fair?  Over the next few months, I am going to lay out the case for how Wall Street undermines American workers and lay out some of the changes that we need to make in this country to grow our middle class and make hard work pay off. Each installment of this series, which we are calling Wall Street's War on Workers, will be posted on my medium page. You can follow along at www.medium.com/@ Today, I want to talk about workers' paychecks. It is pretty simple. It is really simple. Wall Street doesn't want you to get a raise. It doesn't sound plausible. You heard that right. Wall Street doesn't want you to get a raise. Let me explain. Wall Street tries to convince us that when the stock market does well, the economy does well and vice versa.  Well, look around. Visit the town where I grew up, Visit Chillicothe, visit Dover, New Philly, visit Lima, Middletown or Visit a community in my State that was once a proud industrial town that has been hit by globalization. Talk to the workers.  Stock prices are still going up. Yes, they are, and the President of the United States likes to take credit for that as if that is the only story. Talk to workers who haven't had a meaningful raise in years. Talk to workers who have seen their retirement cut. Talk to workers who have watched their healthcare premiums rise. Talk to workers who have seen the cost of childcare and saving for their kids' college and paying off their student loans go up and up and up. That is what happened.  For most Americans, the idea that a stock market rally means more money in their pocket is laughable. That is why, when the President--even today, when he was talking about this tax cut, he was promising that we are doing all these tax cuts for middle-class Well, if you want to give tax cuts to middle-class Americans, give tax cuts to middle-class Don't cut taxes on corporations, cutting them 43 percent--that is what the bill does--if they would let us read it. The last time I read it, that is what it said. They cut the corporate tax rate by 43 percent. They say that money will trickle down, you will get a raise, there will be more jobs. It has never really worked that way. It didn't work in North Carolina that way. It hasn't worked in Ohio that way. It simply doesn't happen.  The President stands there and says: We are going to give the best tax cuts for Christmas you ever saw. He brags about the stock market going up. One of the reasons two-thirds of Americans don't much like this President is because they heard him brag about the stock market and how great that is, but there is nothing in their own pockets when he does that. The money is not trickling down. Workers aren't seeing a $4,000 raise. Nobody really believes that.  The White House made up some phony study that said all this money is going to workers' pockets. It never works that way. It didn't work that way when President Bush--in 2001, 2003, President Bush did a big tax cut bill. Let me give you one statistic about that tax cut bill in 2001 and 2003, those two bills. In that tax cut bill, 27 percent of the benefits went to the richest 1 percent--27 percent.  The pages are pretty good in math because they are still taking math class--27 percent of the benefits of that tax bill went to the richest 1 percent. That sounds pretty outrageous, because the richest 1 percent didn't really need it. Now, in this tax bill, 62 percent of the benefits in this tax bill go to the richest 1 percent--62 percent of the benefits in this tax bill go to the 1 percent. Why is that? Well, one reason is that a number of Members of Congress have said this. When they go across the street to Republican headquarters to make their fundraising calls, their contributors say: Don't call me back for campaign money until you give me and my friends a tax cut.  Get that. Don't call me for campaign money until you go back across the street and give me and my rich friends a tax cut. How corrupt is that? How awful is that? How unfeeling is that? How counterproductive is that for our economy?  The data backs that up. Workers' share of income has fallen over the last four decades. Wage inequality has risen, especially at the largest companies. Some may argue that workers who have retirement accounts share in the benefits when the stock market does well. Only 50 percent of private sector workers have these types of accounts at all, and they use them to make long-term investments for their retirement. The short-term profits that drive so much of corporate decision making have little effect on accounts workers will not touch for several decades. Just because workers have retirement accounts doesn't mean they are able to save. In fact, 70 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in retirement savings.  Remember I said four out of nine or 44 percent of Americans couldn't come up with $400 in emergency spending for a trip to the dentist or $400 to fix a car? Four out of nine Americans couldn't come up with that. Well, it is even worse because 70 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in retirement savings. Do you know why they have less than $1,000 in retirement savings? Because their wages haven't gone up for a decade or so.  The fact is, a paycheck is how most workers pay their bills every month and put food on the table each night. Wall Street has a lot to say about how much should be in that paycheck.  Remember, at the beginning of this speech, I stated that Wall Street doesn't want you to get a raise. Some of my colleagues--particularly those who get a lot of money from Wall Street and think Wall Street should run the country even more than they do--but when I said Wall Street doesn't want people to have a raise, here is how that works.  Last month, Bank of America downgraded Chipotle's stock because an analyst decided the company employees were working too many hours and getting paid too much. Wall Street downgraded their stock because the analyst said their workers were making too much.  Do you remember what happened when American Airlines gave their employees a raise? They were punished in[[Page S8015]]the stock exchange. They were getting paid too much. The banks decided that Chipotle employees worked too many hours and earned too much money. The stock declined by 3 percent. It didn't matter that they were profitable, employees were happy. It didn't matter that their employees were productive. It didn't matter that they were a good company. Their stock price went down because the analyst said they were paying their workers too much. Some of you have been to I am guessing their workers are not making $100,000 a year. I guess they are making $10, $12 an hour.  I went to my high school reunion a couple of years ago. I sat across from a woman who worked at a major national bank, a well-known bank. I don't need to cite the name. When I worked at my family farm growing up, I used to put my $120-every-2-week paycheck in that bank. It has been sold several times and is now part of a major Wall Street bank. She has worked there 30 years. She has been a teller in that bank for 30 years. She makes $30,000 a year. She has 30 years of service in this bank and makes $30,000 a year. Do you want me to list what the top management of that bank makes? Tens of millions of dollars in compensation, stock options, and stock buybacks, huge dividends because they own so much of the bank. This woman makes $30,000 a year. What is right about an economy like that?  The entry level wage at Chipotle is between $9 and $10 an hour. It is typical for fast food. It is clearly not enough to lift a family of three out of poverty. So Chipotle wanted to give raises to their workers, and Wall Street slapped them for doing it. Wall Street's attacks on workers' wages have not been limited to  I mentioned American They announced pay raises for their pilots and flight attendants earlier this year. Wall Street punished the company, dropping its stock by 5 percent.  Citibank, one of the Wall Street firms we sometimes talk about, is a $2 trillion bank--somewhere close to that. I may be wrong about that, but there are six banks in the country whose assets are over $1 trillion, as high as--I think JPMorgan Chase is higher. Citibank analysts actually wrote this about American Airlines:       This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again.      Shareholders get leftovers.  Think of that. So they gave their workers, their pilots--I assume the Senator from North Carolina and Leigh and all the people at the desk there--I think that probably you want airline pilots to be paid pretty well. I think you do. Flight attendants make all the flying we do a little bit easier. This company wanted to pay them more and Wall Street says:       This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again.      Shareholders get leftovers.  Really? Think about this. Companies are more profitable, CEOs are getting paid more and more, and executive compensation is up, stock prices are up, and workers are getting paid less. Then, when they want to pay the flight attendants and the pilots a little more, they complain because labor is being paid first again. Never mind that the labor in question simply pushed to get paid the same as their counterparts at United and Think about that.  American Airlines decided they should pay their workers who do roughly the same job the same as United and They thought that would be a good thing for competition reasons, for hiring workers, and maybe even for Wall Wall Street said: No, really, we don't want that to happen.  I wonder how much that analyst at Citibank is paid. Some of you would call that class warfare, but I would call it an interesting fact if I knew what it was, but imagine the nerve of saying that shareholders get the leftovers. When is the last time Wall Street got the leftovers?  By ``labor,'' what we are talking about is people who create wealth for the company. It is the workers who create wealth. Management is important, of course, setting the direction of the company and doing all that management does in most corporations and does well, but rank-and-file workers--whether it is the woman who cleans the floor or the food service people in the basement, or whether it is the data entry person or whether it is the mid-level management person, whether it is the sales force, whether it is the CFO, workers create wealth for their companies, and shouldn't they share in some of that wealth? Don't you think pilots provide a lot of productivity and wealth to that company?  A JPMorgan analyst described the raises to the American Airlines pilots a different way. He said it is a ``wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups.'' Think about that.  One of the things that amuses me--except it bothers me more--whenever we talk about a wage increase, do you know what companies always say? They say: If we raise the minimum wage for these $7 or $8 or $9 workers, we are going to have to raise prices and lay people off, but they never say that when a top management employee gets a $1 million raise. You only have to lay people off and raise the price of the product if you raise the minimum wage, but if you give somebody a six- or seven-figure bonus, you don't have to worry, that is not going to cause anything. That is how phony these arguments are that they make and frankly how revolting these arguments are.  Wall Street didn't call it a wealth transfer of $1 billion to its labor group. Wall Street didn't call it a wealth transfer when the CEO of JPMorgan got a 4-percent raise and was paid--anybody want to guess? Do any of the pages want to guess? Does any of the staff want to guess? Their CEO is paid $28 million a year, but that happens to be the same company where the woman I sat across from at a high school reunion makes $30,000 a year after 30 years of service. I don't wish him any ill will, certainly, for the $28 million he makes. The people who work directly with the public, who have to listen directly to the complaints, who have to spend money coming to work and wearing nice clothes because they are a bank teller, making $30,000 a year? What is fair about that? None of the banks complained about that being a wealth transfer.  Remember that line, a wealth transfer of $1 billion to its labor group? None of the banks complained about a wealth transfer when Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was allowed to retire with tens of millions of dollars in compensation after overseeing a massive scandal that caused the bank's stock to tank.  Do you know what I hear in the Banking Committee from time to time? These CEOs, if their company has cheated people, their company has made a huge mistake that caused problems for the company, they often come in and say: You know, we are sorry--we are kind of sorry--and we are going to give up our bonus. They say they are going to give up their bonus. They are already making $8 or $10 or $12 or $15 million. Now they are going to give up their bonus. How generous of them.  If paying employees is a wealth transfer, as the JPMorgan analyst said, but CEO bonuses are not a wealth transfer, it raises the question: Who exactly does Wall Street think the wealth belongs to? Who does it think is creating the wealth for these companies? Companies can't be profitable without the workers. Wall Street seems to think the whole cake belongs to the CEOs and stockholders while workers only deserve crumbs.  It has not always been like this.  In the past, banks actually invested in businesses and the workers on Main Street, but the corporate business models have changed. According to a recent analysis, only 15 percent of Wall Street funds are invested in businesses, down from the majority of funds several decades ago. Instead of investing in real businesses, in real towns that create real jobs and build real communities, they spend billions buying back stock and handing out CEO bonuses. This change has worked out pretty well for Wall  Even though Wall Street has 4 percent of all U.jobs, it accounts for 25 percent of all corporate profits. Pretty good, huh? It is not for that teller who works at the bank in Mansfield, OH, but for the stockholders and the As anyone can tell you, it hasn't worked out that well for most people.  CEOs are evaluated on the quarterly performance of their company's stock. They are compensated, in large part, with company shares, but most Americans don't think in terms of 3-month earnings quarters. They think in terms of school years, they think in terms of 30-year mortgages, and they think in[[Page S8016]]terms of how many years before I retire and how much money do I have to save to be able to.  Main Street investors and workers only make a profit when a company's stock market value continues to rise over time. Wall Street and Main Street's interests no longer match up. That is the problem with our economy today. Wall Street's interest are not the same as Main Street's interests. Wall Street does well, Wall Street gets bigger and bigger compensation, and workers see their wages stagnate. Folks in the corporate boardroom are not forced to consider what is in the long-term interest of workers, what is in the long-term interest of small-time investors, what is in the long-term interest of the communities that have helped them grow and made them rich. For them, workers are nothing more than a line item in a budget that ought to be minimized. It is why they have no problem taking pay out of the pockets of workers--pay that would otherwise drive innovation and productivity--all to boost short-term profits for CEOs and speculators.  When you get short-term profits, you are going to get more money in your bonus, you are going to get more money in your stock buybacks, and you are going to get more money in your executive compensation. All of it is set up and all of it is aimed at helping top management and top stockholders enrich themselves. It is not giving back to the community, not creating workers' wealth, and not investing in the future. It is all about short-term profits because that means huge compensation for the CEOs of Nothing in their business model forces these executives to view the workers making burritos at Chipotle as real people with real families.  I will go back to that. Chipotle did the right thing, and they gave raises to their employees. American Airlines did the right thing, and they gave raises to their employees. But the stock market, Wall Street crushed them for it, and that is what has to change.  Until the banks and Wall Street respect a hard day's work and understand that work must have a value for the economy to grow, we will continue to see the consequences. The gap between Wall Street and Main Street will keep growing. Workers' wages will decline. Our middle class will shrink. Wall Street executives and CEOs will get bigger and bigger bonuses.  We will continue here to give tax cuts to the richest people in the country, and our economy and our economic growth will continue to lag. The rich get richer and the middle class shrinks. That is the formula. The rich get richer and the middle class shrinks. Haven't we had enough of that? Why should we still be doing that?  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgS8013.txt,2106,COMMUNITY INSTITUTION MORTGAGE RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,13.0,December
869,topic-id,858,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Hawaii and Senator Durbin for his work and Senator Cortez Masto, who is off to a really good start in her first year in the I thank them for their work on this issue that is personal to Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Hirono because they are not that far removed from coming to this country.  My family has been here longer, but this issue is personal to me because of the people I met whom I will mention in my relatively short remarks. I want to tell some stories about people I have met.  Immigrants in my State and across this country make vital contributions to our economy and local communities. They are business owners and entrepreneurs. They are educators and students. They are workers and leaders in the community. They serve our Nation in the military.  For many immigrants brought here as children--and this is the key point--this is the only country they have ever known. They may speak Spanish at home or speak Arabic at home or they may speak Bengali at home or they may speak Urdu at home, but they don't know those countries they came from because they were small children when they came.  President Trump promised to go after violent criminals, not innocent children. Unfortunately, his efforts have been aimed not at violent criminals who should, in fact, be removed from our country, but he has gone after so many innocent families and innocent children.  My daughter Emily is a legal aid lawyer for immigration in She has told me stories of families who have played by the rules, they worked hard, they are active in their church, they hold full-time jobs, and they are raising their kids. Their kids are doing well in school, and the mother and father get deported, not because they have ever committed a crime but because they came here a number of years ago to escape violence in the countries they came from.  Those are not the same situations exactly as these DACA kids, but we know who these DACA children are--these We shouldn't be targeting young people who are contributing to this country--the country they grew up in, and the only home they have ever known. They are working, going to school, paying taxes, and serving in our military.  Ariel was brought to the United States as a baby when he needed medical treatment for a rare condition. He has lived here ever since. He attends Cuyahoga Community College, a few hours from my home. He is working toward a degree in business administration. He wants to be an entrepreneur who will create jobs in his community and my community. Other Dreamers have jobs, and they are contributing already to our community.  I heard from Elvis, who grew up in Northwest He graduated from Ohio State and works at He told us:       The contributions of DACA recipients are not only present      in metropolitan areas but also in rural ones. This is evident      to me, someone who grew up in rural Ohio, and whose family      continues to live there, every day.  Nathali in Columbus works as a product development and design engineer at She has lived here since she was 9. Her DACA status expires this summer. If she isn't protected, she will probably have to give up her job. She is contributing to America's economy, to Ohio's auto industry, and she pays taxes.[[Page S7970]]  I heard from Vania in Delta, OH, a suburban farm community west of She oversees the entire human resources department in her company, one of the largest bell pepper growers in the country. She said:       I was raised in this community, graduated high school and      college here, and am currently giving back to it in my role.      I have established myself as a contributing member of this      community and for this reason, among many others, I deserve a      chance to continue my work.  All she says is: I want to continue my work. I want to continue raising a family. I want to continue contributing to this country. I want to continue to work in my community. I want to continue to be a good citizen. She is not asking for a handout. She wants what most Americans want, to be able to keep doing her work.  There is no question our immigration system is broken, but we don't fix it by kicking out these contributing members of our communities who grew up here--underscore that. They may not have been born here, but they grew up here. They know our country. They live in Toledo and Dayton and Xenia, and they live in Those are their lives, as it was my life growing up in  We don't fix our immigration system by kicking out these contributing members who grew up here and made their home here--who are American in every sense except the paperwork.

446,topic-id,1054,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  This rule provides for consideration of two bills dealing with Iran and its continued support of international terrorism. In addition, the rule makes in order all submitted amendments.  These bills were the subject of hearings in the Financial Services Committee and were marked up and reported favorably to the Both[[Page H9855]]bills received bipartisan support in the committee, and I would expect that we will see significant bipartisan support on the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, it is no secret that Iran's leaders have a threat to our way of life. We don't have to look any further than Iranian support for lethal attacks on U.troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly through IEDs, to witness Iran's hostility toward us. Going back several decades, Iran has routinely terrorized the Middle East and has sought to export terror worldwide.  Iran's numerous threats to annihilate our friend and ally, Israel, are a steady drumbeat that should continuously remind us of Iran's threat.  In 2001, the Ayatollah Khamenei is quoted as saying: ``It is the mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to erase Israel from the map of the region.''  In 2002, a leader of Hezbollah, which is a known extension of the Iranian regime, said: ``If Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide.''  But lest we think these are the views of the past, the Ayatollah was quoted in 2014 saying that ``this . . . regime of Israel . . . has no cure but to be annihilated.''  And we could go on. The evidence of Iran's intent on the destruction of Israel is nearly endless. Just yesterday, the commander of Iran's revolutionary guards offered to support Palestinians if they choose to stage an armed uprising to take by force Israel's newly recognized capital:  Any country whose leaders actively support terrorism against Israel and whose leaders take an official position that the nation of Israel should be eliminated from the Earth are, and always must be, a sworn enemy of the United  But it is not just Other Middle Eastern allies in the United States have been the target of Iran's hostility as well. Namely, Saudi Arabia has been increasingly threatened by the Iranian regime.  In 2011, our FBI and DEA agents successfully disrupted a plot by Iran to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the U.here in Washington, D.The uncovered plot included bombing a restaurant in D.at which the Saudi Arabian Ambassador was planning to eat. The bombing would almost certainly have killed innocent Americans as well.  The list could go on.  Iran has fomented unrest in Iraq, has sought to subject Sunni Muslims to Shiite militias, has supplied the Syrian regime in its years-long civil war, has supported Hezbollah and Hamas, has flagrantly disregarded international law by building a nuclear program, and has taunted the United                              {time}  1230  Who can forget the image of U.Navy sailors, hands behind their heads, forced to kneel under gunpoint on an Iranian military vessel? Or the thinly veiled attacks on U.troops in Iraq using proxy militant groups? Or the numerous incidents in the Persian Gulf involving harassment of the U.Navy?  Yet, against this backdrop, the United States entered into an agreement with The agreement, commonly referred to as the ``Iran deal,'' was opposed by a bipartisan majority in the It relaxed sanctions on Iran, opened channels for business investment, and allowed Iran a pathway forward on a nuclear bomb.  Further, while having the impact of a treaty between two nations, the Obama administration chose to call the agreement by another name and, in so doing, bypassed the United States This political commitment by President Obama to Iran is the reason for these two bills today.  The first bill, H.1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, targets the finances of Iran's ruling class. Its goal is threefold: One, aid U.authorities in their efforts to eliminate money laundering by the Iranian regime; two, expose the sectors of the Iranian economy that are controlled by Iran's rulers; and three, show the Iranian people how their corrupt government accumulates wealth for itself at the expense of the people.  The Iran deal removes sanctions on many of the known corrupt government entities.

Mr.Speaker, as my family and I sit around the dinner table, my wife, Perry, and my two children, we talk politics, not surprisingly, and there are times where we distinguish good from bad, and we know that Iran is an enemy of the good in this world. It terrorizes the Middle It seeks to eliminate It pursues the destruction of the United And yet, for some reason, the prior administration struck a deal with the Iranian regime, the same regime that has American blood on its hands.

I thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing these bills forward and for my colleagues from the Financial Services Committee who have joined me on the floor today to make the case for this effort. I thank Chairman Sessions for his leadership on the Rules Committee and for providing the debate on this issue today.

The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived.

The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.[[Page H9859]]                                       ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Whether it is turning on the light above the kitchen table in a home or powering heavy machinery in a factory, the American people expect there to be reliable and affordable energy to power their lives and our economy. That is why it is important that we take advantage of all forms of American-made energy.  According to Department of Energy estimates, there are more than 50,000 suitable nonpowered dams across the country that collectively have the technical potential to add 12 gigawatts of hydropower capacity. To put that in context, that is the same potential capacity as two dozen coal-fired power plants.  Back home in Indiana, there are six nonpowered dams located in the Eighth District that could benefit from an expedited permitting process that promotes hydropower generation and provides quality Hoosier jobs.  Unfortunately, unnecessary government red tape is preventing us from taking advantage of clean, renewable energy from hydropower at existing nonpowered dams. The current regulatory process simply takes too long, taking up to a decade to approve a project, which stifles the investment needed to bring additional capacity at existing dams online.  We have the opportunity to change this with H.2872, the Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Specifically, this legislation cuts through the red tape and instructs FERC to create an expedited permitting process that will result in a final decision on an application in just 2 years or less.  Streamlining the permitting process for qualifying nonpowered dam projects represents an important first step in modernizing our existing infrastructure. Additionally, it will incentivize investments in clean hydropower development, allowing us to take advantage of an American source of energy.  I applaud both sides of the aisle for their work to reach a bipartisan solution, and I ask my colleagues to support H.2872.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the gentlewoman from New York's legislation, H.3971, and I thank her for her leadership on this very important issue.  As many of my friends here today know, Dodd-Frank and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have made life very difficult for many. Luckily, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act will, once again, solve a problem that they created, this time regarding escrow and mortgage servicing requirements.  The CFPB rule regarding these accounts has done nothing more than accelerate industry consolidation in this space, particularly causing harm to rural consumers, leaving them with even less financing options.  This bill reverses that problem, though, and will help bring local banks and financial institutions back into the picture. This bill simply lets them reenter the mortgage market and directs the CFPB to exempt them from the escrow account requirement of Dodd- Now, though this is a bipartisan bill, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle may claim that this bill removes consumer safeguards, but I would argue that this CFPB rule that they support creates an unnecessary burden on local banks and credit unions, which, in the end, hurts local communities and people that they claim to protect with this very rule.  Mr.Speaker, I am glad this bill remains largely bipartisan and, as I said, returns power back to the community financial institutions and ensures that consumers have credit through various credit choices.

Luckily, Mr.Poliquin's bill helps us to achieve this goal by requiring that the Treasury Department provide a report to Congress on the financial assets of these senior Iranian officials involved in corruption and illicit finance.

This is a key aspect of the bill, since most news is disseminated through government-controlled outlets. True information is hard to come by.

We have corn and soybean farms all across Illinois that have been worked by generations of farm families. And they even go through the rolling hills of the Driftless Area in the Galena What the Driftless Area means is that this is a gorgeous stretch of land where the last ice age actually didn't flatten, and so we have wonderful farmland in that region as well.  A little bit to the east of the Galena Territory, we have a town called Freeport, which is also known as Pretzel City, USA, and it is home to the Union Dairy, which recently celebrated its centennial birthday.

Senator Everett Dirksen, a Senate office building right down the road here is named after Senator He came from Pekin, Illinois, which is in my congressional district. If you don't know the history of Everett Dirksen, he was actually one of the authors of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1968.  Let's go to where I live, Rock Island It was the location of the very first railroad bridge over the Mississippi River, built in 1856. And since we are all getting into this Abraham Lincoln part of our State's history, Abraham Lincoln was the attorney for the bridge company that I just mentioned. Then, 2 years after that bridge was built, our region was the host--I know Congressman Bost said that his district was the only district that had two Lincoln-Douglas debates. Well, there is actually another congressional district that had two debates. One was in Freeport in 1858, in August of that year, and then another was in Galesburg in October of 1858.

701,topic-id,869,"Madam President, today we are closing in on a critical decision that will have a lasting impact on the innovation-driven economy of the United The Chairman of the FCC has decided to repeal a critical consumer protection known as net neutrality. This is a wrongheaded move. It is misguided. It is being driven by big cable interests that want to continue to gouge consumers and charge them more, making sure that consumers either pay or have their internet lines slowed down.  This decision turns the success of what has been an essential 21st-century innovation over to those in big corporations, instead of making sure that Main Street innovators continue to do what they do best. I don't think the American people want cable companies to be the gatekeeper on the internet. They want to have the FCC continue to play a role in making sure that an open internet is there for all, so that small businesses, entrepreneurs, and innovators can continue to build on the success of communicating with their consumers and their business partners without having artificially slowed-down lines.  Who would this impact if the FCC moves forward?  You could say that seniors would be impacted with regard to receiving their telehealth medicine and that students would be impacted in the slowing down of their education. Families who access educational tools for their children could also see charges, and the open highway that has been so important in making sure that new internet businesses are started could be impacted.  The 1 reason we have to fight this decision--making sure that we do everything we can to stop the FCC from implementing this rule and giving consumers the protection of net neutrality--is that it will harm our internet economy. Last summer we had a townhall meeting about this, where I heard from many of my constituents. I then sent in many business cases to Chairman Pai so that he would understand why this impacts us so much.  Let's make sure that we understand what is happening. The FCC had rules that had prevented companies from throttling, or blocking, and it had paved the way for many great successes. In the United States, we have Fortune 500 companies and a tech industry that is responsible for 7 percent of our Nation's GDP and 6.9 million jobs in the United States of  Why would you change the rules now? Why would you leave after having made sure critical protections were in place and, instead, replace them with the ability for certain companies--cable, specifically--to wreak havoc on this economy?  Thirteen percent of Washington State's economy depends on a healthy internet sector. The internet economy for our State supports 250,000 jobs, and at a time when the Nation has not had enough wage growth, these tech jobs have been a bedrock for the middle class.  Chairman Pai is clearly not focused on the 250,000 jobs and the 13 percent of our State's economy. Just this past weekend, I and my colleague, Congresswoman DelBene, met with many of these small businesses. Their message was loud and clear: Please stop Chairman Pai from ruining the internet by taking away key protections that make sure our businesses run successfully.  Chairman Pai is abdicating his role. He is abandoning the consumers whom he has sworn an oath to serve, and he is turning his back on innovators. He has really changed the direction for us and our innovation economy. I know that he thinks this is a light touch, but I guarantee you that it is a ``no touch'' regulation. What we need is to make sure that these companies do not artificially charge consumers, small businesses, and Main Street more for what they already are doing now and doing successfully. Obviously, an open internet rule and the rules that we are living under now have fueled an innovation economy. Every business plan of every startup relies on the company's ability to be able to contact its consumers.  With this much of our economy at stake, let's not continue to make mistakes. Let's continue to fight here in the Senate and make sure that we stop Chairman Pai and the FCC from having the resources to implement this rule. It is so important now that we continue to fight for small businesses, for Main Street entrepreneurs, and for the innovation economy.  We deserve to have an open internet. As the small businesses and innovators just said to me this past weekend in Seattle, this is really like siding with the big companies and saying that they are going to make all of the decisions, that they are the ones that are going to be in control. They are not going to be for competition, and they are not going to be for this level of innovation. They are going to slow down what is one of the best parts of our economy.  I hope that our colleagues will join the fight and stop the FCC, in any manner possible, from implementing what is, literally, a very, very anticompetitive strategy and one that is very, very focused on big corporations, instead of the innovation economy of the future.

1066,topic-id,1109,"Madam President, I come here today to again speak in support of comprehensive tax reform. For weeks, I have worked to highlight the enormous benefits that our tax reform efforts will have for the economy. I am very excited about the point where I think we are now because I know this will help our middle-income families, workers, and businesses of all sizes.  I think it should not be lost that the tax reform bill doubles the standard deduction. In my small State of West Virginia, 83 percent of the people living there don't itemize. They are going to use the standard deduction, and that is going to be doubled. It also significantly increases the child tax credit, which is great for families and great for young families with children trying to make ends meet.  It will make America's businesses more competitive around the world, which I think will lead to higher wages and more opportunities for our workers.  I encouraged my colleagues to join these efforts as the Senate proposal worked its way through the Senate Finance Committee and again as it came to the Senate floor for debate. Next week, we hope to see the conference committee report on the Senate floor.  Last week, I explained why I was proud to cast my vote for this critical legislation. I expressed my optimism that the Senate and the House would come together, reconcile the differences between the two bills, and settle on an agreement that would provide real relief and real opportunity for the American people.  Today, we are closer than ever to getting comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform across the finish line, and that is why I am standing here to explain why it is so important that we move it all the way through this process and pass these reforms.  I asked you to take my word, and I have for the last several weeks and months, but now, today, I ask you to not simply take my word on this. Throughout the process, when I have been back at home in West Virginia, I have heard from constituents, friends, and even strangers who are really rooting for this effort. They are rooting for it because they understand what a difference it will make in their lives. Whether I am at a roundtable discussion or at the grocery store, so many West Virginians have shared with me what tax reform would mean for them and their families. They have encouraged me and they have encouraged us to get this done because they know what tax reform would do for our State in terms of jump-starting the economy.  One West Virginian I recently heard from, Donald from Beckley, recently wrote to me on behalf of his sons and grandchildren, who he said will ``reap the rewards'' of the tax reform bill. He wrote:       There are too many minimum wage jobs in West Virginia and      not enough higher-paying jobs for advancement. There is no      ladder for the young people to climb anymore.  Donald added that he would be very surprised if the tax bill doesn't help solve this problem. If we don't see higher wages, which we believe we will, Donald said that he would be surprised. I know we are going to see higher wages. He said: ``I really hope that the Senate and House get this bill to the President's desk before Christmas so he can sign it.''  This week, similar support was echoed by a number of groups and organizations in West The National Federation of Independent Business said that both the House- and Senate-passed tax reform proposals ``recognize the need for small business tax relief, which means businesses could reinvest in their businesses and employees, create local jobs in rural and urban areas of West Virginia.''  I had to kind of laugh when they said ``urban'' areas in West I am not sure we truly have urban areas. We have many rural areas. But we have great towns in West  The NFIB went on to say: ``We can't afford to miss this once-in-a-generation opportunity to help Main Street businesses grow and create jobs.''  The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which represents businesses small and large in the State, also expressed support for the tax reform effort this week by calling it a ``real win-win'' and noting that ``by making tax rates more competitive, small businesses will be able to reinvest in growing their operations and creating more[[Page S8030]]jobs, and individuals will be able to determine how best to spend their hard-earned money, further stimulating economic growth.'' The chamber also pointed out that this effort is expected to grow jobs in our State by roughly 5,000 new jobs. To some States, 5,000 might not sound like a lot, but in a State such as ours, 5,000 jobs would be welcomed and welcomed heartily. They also highlighted that West Virginians are expected to see an average reduction of nearly $2,000 in their Federal taxes that they pay. That is a significant amount of money for hard-working families across our State, to be able to determine how they want to spend their money.  Additionally, the State director of the West Virginia chapter of Americans for Prosperity recently said:       This is a huge step for taxpayers. This is going to make      American businesses competitive again. It's going to put more      money in the pockets of West  Finally, our West Virginia manufacturers--we have a great manufacturing sector--weighed in by saying:       Manufacturers large and small know this reform will mean      more jobs in America, more investment in America, and more      men and women making things in . . . Our elected      leaders now need to seize this opportunity, get tax reform      across the finish line, and send it to President Donald      Trump's desk.  I couldn't agree more.  Many of the folks I have quoted represent numerous businesses and numerous people who work in and for those businesses.  To get this economy growing is incredibly important, and that is what we are going to do. It is time to seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity. It is time to get tax reform across the finish line. It is time to send this pro-growth legislation to President Trump's desk. Families, workers, and small businesses in West Virginia and across this country are counting on us. They are counting on us to do the right thing, to be big and bold, to get this economy moving. That will result in more jobs, higher wages, more investment, and more opportunity and optimism about the future of our country.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I look forward to voting for this bill.

31,topic-id,1935,"Mr.President, first, I want to thank my friend Senator Nelson for his comments from the floor in regard to the tax bill that we will be voting on later this week. The experience I had this morning underscores the issues that Senator Nelson has brought to the floor. I had a meeting with the Greater Baltimore We had business leaders, labor leaders; we had advocates from different segments of our community; and we had graduate students there. They all expressed concern about our voting this week on a tax bill that we first saw on Friday evening--the latest version.  It is still fundamentally flawed, as Senator Nelson has pointed out. I say that it is fundamentally flawed because it gives significant, big tax cuts to corporations and high-income taxpayers and leaves middle-income taxpayers footing the bill.  The conference report makes it worse because they lower the highest tax rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent--another advantage for high-income taxpayers. In addition, the estate tax is doubled, which affects 0.2 percent of the wealthiest people in this country. Corporations not only get the lower tax rates cut from 35 percent to 21 percent, but they also get relief from the alternative minimum tax. To make matters even worse, the tax relief for middle-income families is temporary, whereas the tax relief for businesses is made permanent.  It is definitely a tax bill that is going to hurt middle-income taxpayers. In my own State, independent analysis shows that 800,000 Marylanders will end up paying more in taxes. Guess who is going to foot the bill, who is going to pay for the big deficit.  If you look at the corporate tax cut alone, that is somewhere close to the $1.15 trillion we have been talking about, which is baked into the bill to increase the national debt by $1.5 trillion. I think that is unconscionable; I think it is unconscionable to say that we can afford tax cuts when we already have these large deficits that are going to make us borrow more money and make our economy more dependent.  The truth is, even the Republicans are telling us, even with dynamic scoring, we are going to have a $1 trillion tax gap in the deficit. In reality, the $1.5 trillion is conservative. When you look at the individual tax relief, it is temporary; it expires. Some expire in 2 years.  Most of my Republican friends have said: Just extend it. If you extend it,[[Page S8062]]there will be even a deeper hole in the deficit--closer to $2 trillion. Who is going to pay for that? Middle-income families are going to pay for it. They are not just being left out as far as tax relief is concerned; they are being asked to foot the bill for the tax cuts for corporations and high-income taxpayers.  In addition, it will affect other elements that middle-income taxpayers depend upon. This is a direct attack on Medicaid and We see that. We saw that in the budget instructions, where we had to cut Medicare and We see that in the pay-go rules. We see that the next chapter of this tax reform bill will be, well, now we have these deficits, and we have to pay for it. Who is going to be held responsible for paying for it?  We know that it is going to affect our own budgets. I am now hearing that we are going to take it out on our own Federal workforce, deny them a pay raise for next year or have fewer Federal workers to carry out their mission or make them pay more for benefits. We know that is going to come. The argument is going to be that we have these large deficits now, and we have to do this.  How are we going to respond to the issues Senator Nelson talked about on disaster relief when we have these large deficits? We know that we are going to be asking middle-income families not only to make a sacrifice on the tax cut, not only to pay for the deficit created directly by this but, also, in the future, to pay with cuts in government spending.  In addition to that, we have 13 million Americans who will lose their health coverage under this bill because of the elimination of the individual mandate--13 million. That is going to affect 13 million families. It is going to affect more than that. Guess what these families do. They use emergency rooms rather than going to their family doctors. They enter the healthcare system in a more expensive way. They don't have the money to pay for the visits, and it becomes part of uncompensated care. All of us pay higher premiums, and our healthcare system becomes more expensive.  That has been one of the bright spots of the Affordable Care Act--reducing the number of uninsured. Now we are going to be moving in the opposite direction. The Affordable Care Act has worked. The Republicans tried to dismantle it, and they couldn't succeed. The worst part is, you are counting the loss of insurance of 13 million as a revenue gain for the Treasury and then spending that money. That is unconscionable.  In Maryland, we have particular problems with this bill. Not only will we see a problem for the Federal workforce--a large number who live in Maryland--but also the State and local tax deductions. Maryland has the largest number of taxpayers who take advantage of State and local tax deductions on their Federal tax returns. In other words, you don't have to pay a tax on a tax. That makes sense. It has been in our Tax Code since its beginning because we recognize federalism, and it is morally wrong to pay tax on tax.  Maryland has the most taxpayers who take advantage of State and local tax deductions, close to 50 percent. The average for Maryland--this is the average--is $12,900 that they deduct for State and local taxes. Under the conference report, that is going to be limited to $10,000. That means the average Maryland taxpayer will have to pay taxes on $2,900 more, but think about all those who have a lot more in State and local taxes who are going to be denied that help.  I was talking to some of our local government officials over the weekend. They are going to be disadvantaged by it. It was an interesting analysis. We don't think about what this bill is going to do and all the consequences, but if you are in a State that has its own itemized deductions, like Maryland--we have itemized deductions on our State income tax return, and our standard deduction will be significantly lower than the standard deduction under this conference report.  You are going to have Marylanders who are not going to be able to take their State deductions because you can't take State deductions unless you use the Federal itemized deductions. It is estimated that nationwide only 5 percent of the taxpayers will be using itemized deductions. Guess what. If you don't use the itemized deduction at the Federal level, you can't take the State itemized deductions. This is going to have a direct impact on our State and local governments. Yet that hasn't been considered.  Quite frankly, the consequences of this bill haven't been debated. We haven't gone through public hearings because of the process that was used--the partisan process, called reconciliation. We haven't seen daylight. We haven't had a chance to know what the impact will be. What impact will it have on property values? We now limit property tax deductions, and we have a further limit on interest deductions on mortgages. What impact does it have on property values? What impact does the reduction of property values have on our economy, have on the individual values for people who have loans on their homes? Are we going to be creating a problem? We don't know because we haven't had any hearings on it.  On Friday, I was with a group of nonprofits that do very valuable work. They are worried about what impact this tax bill will have on charitable giving. When only 5 percent of the taxpayers in this country use itemized deductions, it means a great number of people who were able to take advantage of charitable deductions on their tax returns no longer will have that ability. Does that change their charitable giving? If it changes their charitable giving pattern, what does it do for nonprofits? If our nonprofits can't do that, there is additional pressure on governmental services. Have we thought that out? I doubt we know the consequences. Yet we are not prepared to have hearings on this.  One of the major issues that has had very little discussion is the passthrough. You have heard a lot about it. The reason for this is that 95 percent of American businesses don't use corporate tax returns. They use passthroughs, S corporations, individual proprietorships, partnerships, et cetera. This bill provides a lower tax rate for their passthrough business income at 20 percent. Here is the problem. In an effort to make sure that this isn't a way of getting around paying taxes on salaries, there are certain guardrails that have been put into this bill based upon a person's income, based upon the type of business they are in, based upon the assets of the business, based upon the amount of salaries that are paid in the business. And you are trying to tell me that can't be manipulated in order to shelter income? We are creating a whole new industry in sheltering income under this bill.  I have heard so many of my colleagues talk about the fact that we don't want to outsource jobs. None of us want to outsource jobs. Having competitive rates helps us in that regard, but moving toward a territorial tax structure rewards companies for doing their business offshore. Even if tax rates might be the same, they can use labor costs, or some other costs, to outsource jobs.  Have we thought about that under a territorial tax? Do we know what impact it will have? There are a lot of issues we don't fully understand. We do know there are individual provisions put in here--for example, drilling in the That, to me, should not be part of this bill. I worry about that being expanded to the Atlantic coast and other areas. I think we all should be concerned about it.  The bottom line is this. When you do tax reform, you would hope you would simplify the Tax Code and make it predictable. That is what I hear the most: Let's simplify the Tax Code, and let's make it predictable. Neither will be accomplished with this conference report. With all these temporary tax provisions, you know that we are going to have to deal with extenders. You are not going to be able to plan as to whether this Tax Code will stand the test of time. If you think this is simplification, try to figure out whether you are eligible for the passthrough 20 percent on your business taxes. It is anything but simple.  This bill fails in its principle test of helping middle-income families, which it does not do. It is for corporations, big corporations, and high-income people. It is fiscally irresponsible to add to the debt. It makes our Tax Code more[[Page S8063]]complicated and doesn't give us the predictability we need in the Tax Code, and it should be rejected.

723,topic-id,1584,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to share my deep concern over the current state of America's global diplomacy. A multitude of decisions made by this administration in the last year have caused me to pause and repeatedly ask why, but in no area have I been more perplexed than the actions that have taken place at the State  Ever since the Secretary of State took the helm, there has been a slow, unexplained erosion of the Department and, along with it, the values that it promotes and the vital role it plays around the world. By now, many are familiar with the list of concerns that seasoned diplomats, national security officials, and Members of this body have been raising with increasing alarm over the last weeks and months.  More than 30 key ambassadorships remain without named nominees. Dozens of important senior-level posts remain vacant. Career officials are being cut out of important policy decisions or overruled by leadership, including, sometimes, even on legal issues. The Foreign Service is being hollowed out, with a significantly lower number in the incoming classes, putting at risk the next generation of leaders. Opportunities for midlevel employees are extremely limited, with a freeze on most transfers and promotions. Our most experienced officials--the Department's equivalent of 2-, 3-, and 4-star generals--have been departing or, effectively, forced out and not replaced at the same rate.  I honor the experienced career officials who are stepping in to fill vacancies and are carrying out the Department's important work, but there are limits to what officials can accomplish in an acting role. It is now We cannot afford to have a Department that remains hamstrung because of rudderless stagnation at the top.  Let's be clear. This is not just about numbers or unfilled positions. The numbers do not tell the full story. While the employees at the State Department and USAID can and have been carrying on, it is not an easy task when employees feel that the message they receive from the top is that they and their work are not valued. Understandably, this has an impact on morale, which is now devastatingly low.  In embarking on what has been dubbed a ``redesign'' of the Department, the leadership at State has regrettably left the men and women who so capably and loyally serve it behind. I have heard from many employees who are not just concerned about their own future or careers but who are concerned about the direction of the Department itself and the viability of its legacy. The State Department's leadership has had more than enough time to assess what can be improved. It is beyond time to show the men and women serving at State and USAID that they are not only a valued but a vital part of our national diplomacy and national security strategy.  For weeks, Secretary Tillerson has promised to announce significant progress on his plan to move the Department forward. Tuesday, in a speech to the State Department and USAID personnel, the message was once again underwhelming. Secretary Tillerson continues to tinker around the edges while the Department's core functions are deliberately hollowed out.  While I am encouraged to see him announce a few small but important steps in the right direction, I am worried that he still has not gotten the overall message. Despite calls from me and others on the Foreign Relations Committee and pleas from current and former employees, diplomats, and military leaders, Secretary Tillerson has yet to lift the hiring freeze that remains in place. He announced it would be lifted for the family members of employees--a welcome step but not enough. Freezing or limiting opportunities for family members to join their spouses who are serving abroad never made sense in the first place.  I am, therefore, still left wondering why the hiring freeze has been in place at all, when nearly every other Federal agency lifted it earlier this year. I cannot understand how it has benefited our foreign and civil service. So again I am left asking: Why? Why should we tolerate a massive exodus of diplomatic and development expertise at the State Department and USAID? Our President said recently that we do not need to worry about the fact that many of the senior-level positions at the State Department remain unfilled because when it comes to foreign policy, his opinion is the only one that matters. Why on Earth would he say that? For the thousands of Foreign Service officers around the world working to advance the ideals of the United States, this was a horrible and offensive message.  I am concerned that this administration does not understand how critical a role the State Department and USAID play in our national security policy. They are every bit as vital and critical an element of our national security as the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, our law enforcement, or the countless others in the Federal Government who work tirelessly every day to protect our security, extend our prosperity, and promote our values.  We put our country in danger when we do not give adequate voice and resources to all of our country's national security tools. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said: ``In a turbulent and perilous world, the men and women of the Foreign Service are on the front lines every day, on every continent for us.''  Diplomacy is an investment we make so that we don't have to go to war. Nickel-and-diming it is not in our national security interest.  I made no secret about my deep concerns regarding the current management practices of the Department's leadership, the reorganization and budget debacles, the current senior-level vacancies, and the deep costs that our Foreign Service and development professionals are paying. The United States' foreign policy leadership around the world is also paying the price, and we will continue to pay the price if things aren't turned around quickly.  Even with the few changes Secretary Tillerson announced this week, I believe there are still multiple issues that need to be addressed. I raised many of them recently in a letter to the Secretary with my fellow Democratic colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations If the Secretary truly wishes for the State Department and our country to succeed, he will seriously consider the following concerns:  First, improve transparency. All Senators on the Senate Foreign Relations[[Page S7998]]Committee should receive regular briefings that thoroughly address proposed reorganization plans and decisions.  Second, we need to know the details and timeline for reorganization. The Department must provide a clear timeline--something it has failed to do to date--and provide details about what it is planning.  While there are some parts of the reorganization that we find to be positive, such as improving information technology, I remain concerned that the reorganization may be marginalizing or eliminating critical bureaus and offices that help to inform U.foreign policy. I understand that many of these ideals may not come to fruition, but it is essential for us to receive details in a timely way so that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can carry out its critical oversight function. Again, we are now in the eleventh month of this administration, and we don't yet know when they are going to be submitting their plans for reorganization, and we have not been kept adequately informed.  Third, I would mention filling senior vacancies. The Department must prioritize key senior vacancies and work with the White House to swiftly move forward qualified nominees. The significant vacancies for senior-level management and policy positions in such critical bureaus as Counterterrorism and Political-Military Affairs are deeply troubling. Approximately 30 countries still do not have named Ambassador nominees, including South Korea, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Despite claims that the Senate's slow pace is to blame for the lack of confirmed nominees, the fact is that the Foreign Relations Committee has promptly processed the vast majority of nominees, and only a handful are currently awaiting a Senate vote. We cannot confirm nominees who have not been nominated.  Finally, let me talk about the need to uphold the mission of the The Department's mission statement must continue to reflect the values we hold as Proposed changes send a troubling signal about the administration's vision for the Department and its role in foreign policy. The promotion of democracy and respect for human rights around the world must remain a central part of the State Department's overall mission.  I agree that improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department is critical to our national security given the countless challenges we face as a nation. Reforms to information technology, human resources, and procurement systems are long overdue, and I support the efforts of the Department to streamline special envoys and special representative positions.  I hope, moving forward, the Department will consider Congress as a partner in these endeavors, as well as broader efforts to strengthen America's diplomatic capabilities. However, if the Department continues down its current path, I can assure you that my colleagues and I will use every legislative option we have to address these concerns.  My goal is to ensure that the employees in the State Department have all the resources and support they require to complete their tasks and ensure that the United States remains a global diplomatic leader. I will do everything in my power to guarantee that this goal is accomplished.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

956,topic-id,1956,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about this so-called DACA Program for the Dreamers, the young people whom we have heard so much about, especially in the last couple of months.  As many people across the country know, in September, President Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as This decision and, so far, congressional refusal to pass the Dream Act have created both fear and uncertainty for nearly 800,000 young people across our country, so-called DACA recipients.  I know that a lot of Americans have met these young people over the course of not just the last couple of months but maybe over the course of many years. I had that chance most recently, at least on two occasions, when we set up time to sit with young people who were Once was in the city of Philadelphia, where I sat with young people from both Philadelphia and Lancaster, which is not too far of a drive from Philadelphia--about an hour or so. They came to Philadelphia to sit with us. Then a couple of months later, it was in the Lehigh Valley, which is about an hour just north of The first group was a larger group of maybe 15 young people, and the second group was a group of 3 individuals.  In both of those meetings, I was struck by not just how concerned and worried these young people were about what would happen to them and happen to their friends and, in a larger sense, happen to their families, but I was impressed by their stories--what they had achieved in their young lives. I was also moved by the commitment that they have had to hard work, to being part of the fabric of America, and the real concern that they have had about and the love they have for their own parents. They worried about how this might affect their parents but also had love for the commitment that their parents had made and their family members had made to allow them to succeed in coming here, in some cases as babies or as very young children, and to live in America for all of these years, not technically as citizens but to live full lives.  They were made a promise by the President of the United States that if they were to come forward and make certain disclosures, this program would protect them. I think that promise is inviolate and should not be broken by any administration. Congress certainly has work to do to enforce the promise and to give the promise an even stronger foundation.  You don't have to be on one side of the aisle or the other to be moved by these stories, and I will get to some of the details later. One of the young women was in the first group that I mentioned when we were sitting around a big conference table. Of course, these individuals don't have to sit with me, and they don't have to travel to tell their stories, but they are worried. They are concerned about the policy and how it might affect their lives.  One young woman said to me: The only country I have ever known doesn't seem to want us--or at least that was her impression. She has lived nowhere else.  If you go person after person after person, these are young people who have lived here virtually their whole lives even though they technically were not born here. They have achieved so much and have gone through our schools. Our Nation has invested in them, and they have succeeded in holding down jobs and getting educations and getting higher educations. All they ask is that we set up a process so that they will not be deported.  It doesn't make a lot of sense, the direction in which we seem to be heading. Rescinding the DACA Program will cost the United States of America jobs. I think it will hurt our security over time.  As I said before, it is a broken promise--a promise that was made to young people by our government. It was not just a casual promise but, I would argue, a commitment, a bond, an agreement that should be honored. As I have said so many times before--and I will keep saying it--why would other countries believe us when we make a commitment if we cannot keep our commitment to these young people? Something on the order of 800,000 young people who live in the United States of America were promised that if they came forward, they would be protected. Why would any country believe us after that if we were to break that promise? Why would they believe Republicans or Democrats? Why would they believe the administration--this administration or future administrations--or this Congress or future Congresses down the road, the House and Senate? If we were to break that promise, would our word be good around the world?  These Dreamers are young people who have lived in this country since[[Page S8068]]they were children. They have been law-abiding residents. They have learned They pay taxes. They have secured jobs that have supported themselves and their families. They were made a promise.  What are some of the numbers? Here is the economic impact in the context of one State in our country. In Pennsylvania alone, estimates say that ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program would cost the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania nearly $357 million per year in GDP losses. This is according to the Center for American So, for one State, it is $357 million. How about for the Nation? The comparable number for the Nation is about $460 billion. The first number was with an ``m''--millions--in the context of the The second number is $460 billion, with a ``b''--almost half a trillion dollars--from the GDP over the next decade. Roughly, in the context of a yearly number, it is $46 billion a year.  Even if you don't think that we have to honor the promise, even if you don't believe in the program, why would we want to take a step that would hurt our economy in our losing about $46 billion every year for 10 years, adding up to $460 billion over 10 years?  According to FWD.us, 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed, and repealing DACA could result in an average of 8,500 DACA recipients--young people--losing their jobs each week as a result of that. There are 91 percent of them who are employed--working--in the United States of It is the country that promised them that if they came forward, we would give them protection. They are working every day, following the law, loving this country.  We have told them, at best, that their status or their fate is uncertain. That is the best that we can say about what has happened between the administration's making the announcement a number of months ago and Congress's doing nothing to address this problem.  DACA recipients have jobs in sectors that are critical to our economy, such as healthcare, science and technology, and engineering and math--so-called STEM jobs. Additionally, more than one out of every seven DACA-eligible immigrants has language skills that are currently in short supply in the U.military, according to the New American The U.military benefits when we have individuals residing in our country who have that skill in languages. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that the 1.3 million young people who are enrolled in or who are eligible for DACA pay $2 billion each year in State and local taxes. So they are working, and they are paying taxes.  Dreamers across Pennsylvania and the Nation represent the America that we should all be proud of. I think everyone could agree to that in the work that they are doing and their commitment to our country. We should be proud of that. This is a country in which hard-working young people who are working to better themselves and their communities are given a chance to do just that. That is the kind of country we all profess to believe in. That is the kind of Nation that we want to be.  Another estimate is that between September 5, 2017, when the program was terminated, and March 5, 2018, which is the deadline that is coming up, 122 DACA recipients will lose their protection every day. That means that by March 5 of 2018, 22,000 Dreamers will have lost their DACA protection.  Congress should move immediately--the U.Senate should move immediately--to make sure that we protect these Dreamers and pass the so-called bipartisan Dream Here is what the bill would do in short form. It would allow the Dreamers to become permanent residents if they meet the very stringent qualifications outlined in the bill. We aren't talking about any kind of a free pass. These are young people who have worked so hard to become the very sort of Americans we want: employed, law-abiding, and paying taxes. The numbers of Dreamers in Pennsylvania are about 5,900 individuals who have been given DACA status. Passing the Dream Act would give these young people some security and a future they can count on.  I was proud to support a version of the Dream Act back in 2007 and 2010. We should have an up-or-down vote on the floor of the U.Senate that is a clean version of the Dream Act--not embedded in some other legislation--but an up-or-down vote on the Dream Let's see where people stand. I would hope it would be an overwhelming vote. I think it probably would be. Let's have an up-or-down vote for these young people.  Let's keep the promise to these Dreamers so our promise is good here at home, and our promise and our word and our credibility will be good the world over because if we break that promise, it is going to be pretty difficult for people around the world to believe us on a whole host of fronts. I know that may offend somebody, but that is the way I see it.  Keeping a promise is the principal reason to pass the Dream Act, but we should also try to help our economy, not allow our economy to lose hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years, tens of billions each and every year because we are deporting people who have offered so much to the country, who have worked so hard, who have become part of the fabric of American life, part of the fabric of the American family. These are folks who live in every community, who are part of the fabric of a neighborhood, part of the fabric of a community, part of the fabric of a school, part of the fabric of a State, and the fabric of a nation.  The third reason we should pass the Dream Act is to unite our country. This is one area where we can all come together. We might have a lot of disagreements, and they will be played out this week on the tax bill, on this issue or that issue, but we can bring the country together. Most people in both parties understand what this is all about. They understand the promise, they understand the impact on our economy, and they also understand that a great country can make the right decision on this issue.  By uniting our country on the Dream Act, we can make a downpayment on a bright future for these young people who love the United States of America and who have demonstrated that by their commitment to the country, by their work ethic, and by the commitment they have made to their communities. Let's pass the Dream  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-18-pt1-PgS8067.txt,1828,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,18.0,December

1068,topic-id,1208,"Madam President, I want to cover two topics. There is so much to cover between now and the end of the year, but I want to focus today on two issues. One is the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the second is the so-called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the so-called DACA Program, and in particular the individuals affected by this policy, the I will start with that issue.  The Dreamers, of course, are something on the order of 800,000 young people who were promised that if they came forward and made disclosures, their government would protect them. That is the basic promise that our government made. This is a significant moment in their lives and in the life of the Nation as to whether we are going to keep what I would argue is a sacred promise to 800,000 young people and in my home State of Pennsylvania, at last count, thousands, as many as 5,900, approximately.  In this case, we are talking about this issue because a promise was made, and then in the transition from one administration to the other, a different approach was taken. In September, President Trump decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals This announcement required those whose DACA waivers would expire within 6 months to submit a renewal application in just 1 month--not a lot of time to get that done.  Unfortunately, many DACA recipients were unable to meet this short deadline, and others who managed to get their applications in time were still rejected due to postal delays--not because of something that young person did but due to postal delays. While the administration has said these individuals may be able to resubmit, many are immediately at risk of deportation.  Just imagine that. In fact, it is impossible for me to imagine it, and maybe it is impossible for anyone in this building to imagine that you are an individual who came forward because of this program, because of a promise your government made to you that you would be protected if you came forward. You came forward after years of living in this country--many years wouldn't add up to a long life because these individuals are obviously very young. Some of them came when they were just a couple years old or a couple of months old, and they know no other country. In fact, one individual whom I met with around a big conference table of about 15 to 20 DACA recipients said to me in this meeting a couple of months ago, she said: The only country that I know, doesn't want us. That was her assessment of what the ending of this program should mean to her.  So that is what they are at risk of. They are not just at risk of some theoretical consequence. They are literally at risk of deportation after living here all these years and not knowing any other country because of their circumstances.  It is estimated that 12,000 DACA recipients have already lost their protection--12,000 young people--and that number will grow to some 20,000 by Why would our country break a promise to 12,000 individuals and then 20,000 and then potentially much, much higher numbers? So we can't wait one more day, in my judgment, to help these  Dreamers across Pennsylvania and the Nation already are living in fear and feeling the consequences of this horrific decision.  ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has already picked up a young Dreamer during a routine traffic stop whose DACA waiver had expired. This Dreamer had been waiting to reapply for protection after his initial application was rejected due to--I will say it again--postal delays. While the administration has said they would allow these applications that were rejected due to postal delays the chance to reapply, the administration has been silent on what these individuals should do in the interim. For many Dreamers, this means they must choose between risking deportation and continuing to work and provide for their children and their families, depending on the circumstance.  These Dreamers have done everything right, and their applications were rejected, not due to any action they did not take, but they were rejected for other reasons--due to a failure of our government. Yet, now, they are paying the price.  Risking ICE detention and deportation to countries within which they have never lived as adults is totally contrary to our values. Dreamers are young people who have lived in this country since they were children. They are law-abiding residents who have learned English, paid taxes, gone to school, secured jobs that support themselves and their families.  This program has enabled almost 800,000 young people to grow and thrive in These impressive young people provide enormous contributions to our society, including paying an estimated $2 billion every year in State and local taxes. The economic loss to Pennsylvania is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions. To be exact, by one estimate, it is a $357.1 million loss to the State's How about the Nation overall? By one estimate, if this were to go forward and these young people were to be deported in the numbers some are talking about, it is a national number that is in the hundreds of billions of dollars--by one estimate, north of $400 billion. That is the impact.  So we have to get this done one way or the other. It would be a terrible failure of our government; worse than that, it would be an insult to our country, and it would be breaking a sacred promise.                  Children's Health Insurance Program  Madam President, just a few remarks rather quickly about a major program we are also debating; that is, the Children's Health Insurance We know CHIP expired on September 30. It is a total failure of the government to allow that to happen. It is hard to comprehend that even as some are debating about the size of a corporate tax break, which will be permanent, there is uncertainty, and any uncertainty about the Children's Health Insurance Program is also an insult to the country. Nine million children and their[[Page S8031]]healthcare and the security of their families is on the line. So we need to get the Children's Health Insurance Program passed.  The tragic irony is, the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, passed a bipartisan bill: The Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, the so-called KIDS Act of 2017, reauthorizes the CHIP program for 5 years. There is no reason why--no reason whatsoever--that KIDS Act could not be voted on and passed on the floor of the Senate this afternoon or tomorrow or Monday without any impediment to getting that done, but it is being held up, I guess, as a negotiation tactic or as a way to get a deal on something else.  Children's healthcare should not be subject to any deal or any leverage or any engagement on other issues. We should get it done. If people can spend hours and hours and days and now weeks giving big corporations a permanent tax cut that exceeds $1 trillion, we ought to make sure an existing, effective, bipartisan program for children gets reauthorized.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange). The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgS8017-6.txt,1828,ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION,2017.0,14.0,December
349,topic-id,1126,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from California for not only organizing this evening's Special Order hour, but for his long-term advocacy for working people in this country and for his extraordinary advocacy for the people of the State of  As my colleague described what the Republicans are attempting to do in this tax proposal, it is very clear to me that this isn't tax reform. It is not a tax bill. It is a tax scam. It is a scam in that the American people are being sold a bill of goods.  All across this country tonight, there are millions of Americans who will go to sleep tonight worrying about whether or not they are going to be able to make it through the next week, whether they have enough to pay their bills, to take care of their family, to set aside a little for their retirement. The reason that they are worried about this is they are not making enough money.  So what the Republicans propose to do in this tax bill will make that problem worse. We have spoken over the last several months about an agenda that is really at the heart of this problem, that raises incomes for families, that reduces the costs in people's lives, and that ensures that they have the tools to be successful in the 21st century.  It is an agenda that really focuses on addressing the fundamental and economic anxiety facing millions of American families all across our country. We know it is because people are struggling. They are just not making enough money.  The same can't be said of the biggest corporations in this country, where we are seeing record profits, Wall Street through the roof. So people understand something is not working right in our economy. They are struggling. They haven't seen their wages go up for a very long time. America hasn't had a raise in a long time, yet corporate profits are through the roof and the stock market is through the roof, and people are saying: This isn't working.  So what we should be doing is investing in the creation of good-paying jobs that will result in better jobs, better wages, and a better future. But what this Republican proposal does is it relies on this old Republican theory of trickle-down economics: if we just let people at the very top have more money, it is going to trickle down to the rest of us and we will all benefit.  We know this doesn't work. We have seen time and time again this doesn't work. And part of the reason it doesn't work is because people at the top can only buy so much stuff. The way you really grow the economy is you grow the middle class. Make sure people have a job, have money in their pockets to buy the goods and services that business produces.  If you go to any small business in my State of Rhode Island and you ask small-business owners, ``What do you need to add an employee, to add jobs to your company,'' they will give you the same answer, ``I need customers. I need people to buy what I make and I sell.''  That is why growing the middle class and focusing on raising incomes of working people is actually how you create jobs. Those are the job creators: working people, the middle class of this country who are creating the demand that leads to job growth.  But what this tax scam does is it gives 67 percent of the tax cuts to the top 1 percent, huge benefits for the biggest corporations in this country, further incentivizes companies to ship American jobs overseas, and to realize profits from doing that. It cuts important deductions, in the House bill at least, for student loan interest, medical expenses, State and local taxes. It is going to raise taxes on 87 million Americans, middle class folks, working people.  In order to finance this tax cut for the richest people in this country and the biggest corporations that don't need it, the middle class and working people are going to pay for it and the next generation is going to be burdened with $1.5 trillion in debt over the next 10 years.  We are borrowing money to give tax cuts to big corporations, the wealthiest people in this country, and we are going to shoulder the next generation with that burden?  Shame on them.  So this conference committee is meeting and going to come up with some proposal that apparently is going to be pleasing to their donors.  We know in the Senate some of the donors had the provisions of the bill before Members of the Senate had them. They came out with handwritten notes in the margins because they were so desperate to get this done for the moneyed class. In fact, some of our colleagues admitted it and said something like: Look, if we don't pass this, our donors said, Don't bother calling us.  What we need is tax reform that provides a tax cut to working people and the middle class. We could have done that in a bipartisan way. The last time there was tax reform, there were hundreds of witnesses, months of testimony. This stuff is complicated.  What happened in the House?  Not one hearing, not one witness. Jammed through, as Congressman Raskin said, in the dark of night, at the speed of light. Because the more the American people hear about this tax scam, they know it is not for them. They know they are not going to benefit. They know the same old corporate special interests that have so much influence in this town helped write this bill, and that they are going to benefit from it and they are determined to jam this through, regardless of the public sentiment.  The American people are against this bill 2-1. That number is going to grow the more people learn about it. That doesn't seem to matter.  So I thank the gentleman for inviting me tonight and allowing me to speak. He has been here longer than I have. I can say with all honesty that the day that bill passed the House was one of the worst days I have ever been in this Chamber because I know how this tax scam, this effort by the Republicans in the House is really going to hurt the American people. I have never seen a situation in which public sentiment was so strongly opposed to this measure. Despite that, our colleagues are moving forward with it.  I don't know that my colleague has seen an occasion like this before, but I would like to hear Mr.Garamendi's thoughts on that.

352,topic-id,381,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I think the other thing that is very important to acknowledge here, and I think we have heard the Speaker say this--we have heard Senator Rubio make reference to this--is that the American people, I hope, understand that this is part one of a multipart story. Our Republican colleagues have made it very clear that this tax scam, this sort of giveaway to corporate[[Page H9838]]America and the richest people in this country, is just part one.  Next year, after you give away $1.5 trillion, unpaid for, you come back next year and you say: We have no money. We are going to have to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut Pell grants, cut investments in healthcare, and cut investments in rebuilding the infrastructure of our country.  So our Republican colleagues are setting this up as an effort to gut Medicare and Let's be clear about that. You can't give away $1.5 trillion that you don't have.  And next year they are going to be heard to say: Geez, we have no money. We have to cut all of these programs that middle class Americans and working families rely on to survive and to prosper and to get a shot. And their answer is going to be: There is no money.  And why isn't there any money? Because we gave it away to millionaires and billionaires and corporations and people who didn't need it. As a result of it, you are going to pay for it by cutting Medicare and cutting Social Security and cutting Pell grants.  The immorality of this is stunning.  So I think we have to not only defeat this tax scam, but call it out for what it is. This is an effort by our Republican colleagues to finally get what they want. I think our Speaker has said: I dreamed about it, or, I drank beer thinking about cuts to Medicare and  They call them entitlements. They are not entitlements. These are earned benefits that people get after a lifetime of hard work, of playing by the rules, of doing what is right.  This is phase one of a multiphase plan which will hurt working people in this country, and we have to call them out on it.

356,topic-id,102,"Mr.Speaker, it is important to note here--I think my memory is correct on this--that the $1.5 trillion in debt which will be generated by this tax giveaway is exactly the same number that they cut from Medicare and Medicaid in the budget they just voted on. So we don't have to wonder whether that is the plan. They have already done it in the budget that they have proposed. And as you said, the Speaker, Senator Rubio, and others have already acknowledged this.  So this should be clear.

358,topic-id,318,"The gentleman is correct. They have already voted to cut $1.5 trillion to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, to the biggest corporations; and in order to pay for that, they intend to gut Medicare and Medicaid and a whole range of other very important investments we make, that our country makes, in supporting and strengthening the middle class.  It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone when, next year, as the gentleman said, the deficit hawks return in the warm weather to say: Oh, my goodness, there is no money. We are going to have to end the guarantee of We are going to have to cut Social We are going to have to eliminate or cut Pell grants. We are going to reduce all of these investments which matter so much to working families in this country.  They are intent on doing that. They have tried to do it for the last several years, but not to the magnitude of success that they expect when they drain the coffers by giving away the money, which is exactly their strategy. And it is why we have to fight hard against this tax scam because it is not just a tax giveaway to people who don't need it. It is what it will do to the economy.  I think there was a New York Times analysis of 38 economists. Not one, not any economist I have ever heard of yet, has said that this tax cut will pay for itself.  We keep hearing our Republican colleagues: Oh, this is going to pay for itself. The economy is going to grow, and jobs are going to. It is a pipe dream. There is not a single economist, Republican, Democrat, Independent, who says these tax cuts will pay for themselves because, of course, they won't.  Who will pay for them?

I was just going to say that, for young people, what this tax scam does is particularly damaging because it not only saddles the next generation with $1.5 trillion of debt, but in addition to that, it makes their cost of pursuing higher education more expensive.  Who in their right mind thinks it is a good idea to make it harder or more expensive for young people to go to college? We ought to be making it easier and more affordable, less difficult. Young people are already graduating with enormous debt, going to a tough job market in terms of what they can earn, and the Republicans are taking away the deduction so they can finance a tax debt for the richest people in this country.

And the last thing families need, because the focus has to be on raising family incomes, is a tax scam that is going to raise their taxes.  That is exactly the reverse of what most middle class and working families need. They need more money in their pockets, not less.  And when I hear my Republican colleagues say: This is a tax cut for middle class, that is not true. For 87 million Americans, their taxes will go up. For many Americans, the deductions that they take will be eliminated, and 67 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent.  So it is important, again, that they are trying to jam this through quickly because I think they understand that, if they don't, the more the American people learn about it, the less they like it, and the more they are going to attempt to stop it.

In the fall of 2014, the CFPB finalized a rule allowing financial institutions to post their annual privacy notices online instead of delivering them individually if they met a series of conditions, including not sharing the customer's nonpublic information with unaffiliated third parties.  In December of 2015, Congress went further by enacting an outright exemption from the mailing requirement for financial institutions that, one, do not share nonpublic personal information about a consumer with unaffiliated third parties; and, two, have not changed its disclosure policy and practices since the most recent disclosure was sent to consumers.                              {time}  1030  Institutions that provide financing for vehicle purchases or leases do not meet the criteria set forth by Congress and are, therefore, required to continue issuing paper privacy notices to consumers.

490,topic-id,1129,"Mr.Speaker, I am a little late and I don't know exactly what has been discussed. I serve on the Judiciary Committee with the gentleman, and what we have seen in the Judiciary Committee is scary.  I am honored to be a Member of the United States I am honored to be an American citizen. I see a threat to the independence of the United States Congress in upholding its oath and looking out for the best interests of its people and to our country.  I have Republican friends, as the gentleman does, on the other side of the aisle, and I know that they, in representing their constituents, are not fond of the totalitarian Russian Government and philosophy that threatens NATO countries like Lithuania, and Estonia, and Latvia, and Ukraine, and Georgia, with the power of the Russian military.  They do not like democracy. They do not like America, and they do not like what we represent. They don't like freedom of the press. They don't like freedom of religion. They don't like freedoms of elections. They don't have really free elections. They say they do, but they kill their opponents or they put them in jail on trumped-up charges, and they count the votes. There is nothing good about Russia in regards of democracy, and even within their constitution after they formed a country after the Soviet Union fell apart.  Our Republican colleagues are like sheep, following the President in attacking the FBI; in attacking the Justice Department; in attacking heroic Americans who have risked their lives in the FBI, and heroic Americans like Robert Mueller, who served in Vietnam and risked his life and was wounded there, I believe. And they threaten them and talk to them as if they are complicit with the Clinton campaign and trying to do something to harm President  Mr.Mueller is a Republican, appointed first by a Republican, Bush, and then later by a Democrat, He is as fine a human being as I have come in contact with in my 11 years in Congress, and maybe as fine a human being as I have come in contact with in my 68 years on                              {time}  1345  Mr.Rosenstein said glowing things about him yesterday and how heroic he is and how strong he is, how dedicated he is, how patriotic he is, and how honest he is.  For the Republicans to be trying to take this man down and to take down others who serve in the FBI, the only reason they are doing this is because they are finding information in their charge that implicates the President of the United States in activities that are questionable as far as his oath of office and border on treason. Because of that, they attack the FBI, which is the top layer or the cream of the crop of law enforcement.  And the President goes out and talks about our wonderful first responders, but the top of the line he is against because they question him.  That is when your country no longer exists, when it is all about the leader, not about institutions, and not about other individuals who are doing their jobs in a proper manner.  FBI Director Wray said nothing but good things about Robert I think Robert Mueller's job is in jeopardy from this President, who likes to fire people, which is what he did on television, and he still thinks he is on television. It is a big performance art. It is all about performance art, and the star is Donald He acts and he is the show; and the show goes on, and there is nothing else.  To fire Mueller is part of the show, to question what he has done in arresting Manafort and Gates, guilty pleas, I think, from one of the gentlemen he arrested--was it Papadopoulos?--and then a guilty plea from They don't plead guilty unless they are guilty.  Mueller is doing his job. He is trying to protect I think he is the man of the year and will be the man of the year next year. He is the one person between us and a kleptocracy and group of oligarchs, but kleptocrats who are using their positions in government to benefit themselves financially and to build up their wealth.  This tax bill we are talking about is part of the same thing. It is oligarchs. No inheritance tax, meaning they get hundreds of millions of dollars--hundreds of millions of dollars--and the President goes and says to a middle class family earning $75,000: You will have $2,000 that you can spend any way you want, or you can even save it.  $2,000 is tip change at Orange Julius to those people, the big money, hundreds of millions and hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars as the inheritance tax being repealed and the AMT being repealed and other changes.  And then they said: Oh, well, we only reduced the tax on the wealthiest from 39 percent to 37 because they weren't going to get to deduct as much of their State and local taxes, and it was going to hurt them more.  Well, there are people who aren't in the top bracket who aren't going to get to reduce their State and local taxes, and they gave them nada. They gave all of it to the wealthiest.  And that is what this is about. This is about the wealthiest people taking this country over and an oligarchy, and Trump is representative of them. It is about him. It is not about institutions. It is not about the It is not about people.

26,topic-id,3170,"Madam President, I rise to express my support for the conference agreement on the Tax Cuts and Job Act, the first major overhaul of our Tax Code since 1986. This legislation will provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here in America, and spur economic growth that will benefit all  Let me start by discussing the effects of this bill on individuals and families. Throughout this debate, I have emphasized that reforms to our outdated Tax Code must help working families. I, therefore, authored three key amendments that were retained in the final package.  My amendments allow families to deduct up to $10,000 in State and local taxes, increase the deduction for medical expenses, and protect tax-free contributions for retirement savings.  The original Senate bill would have eliminated the deduction known as SALT that allows taxpayers to avoid paying a Federal tax on State and local taxes that they have already paid. This provision has been in the Tax Code since 1913, when the income tax was first established. It is intended to prevent double taxation. My amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, restored the deduction for property taxes up to $10,000. I am pleased that the final bill goes a step further by allowing the deduction of property and income or sales taxes up to this level, which will assist even more  My work to restore this deduction is especially important to families living in high-tax States like Maine, which has one of our Nation's highest tax burdens; yet Maine's per capita income ranks only 31st, which is nearly $5,200 below the U.average. Maintaining this deduction therefore provides important tax relief for those Mainers who itemize.  My second amendment included in the conference agreement is a very important one. It is aimed at helping Americans struggling with high, unreimbursed healthcare costs, including seniors paying for long-term care for a loved one and those with expensive chronic healthcare conditions. My amendment lowers the threshold for claiming this deduction for these unreimbursed expenses from 10 percent to 7.5 percent of income for 2017 and 2018.  The House bill would have eliminated this longstanding deduction used by approximately 8.8 million Americans annually, nearly half of whom make less than $50,000 per year. Retaining this important deduction and lowering the threshold will provide relief for those experiencing particularly high healthcare costs. That is why AARP and 44 other consumer groups strongly endorsed my amendments, stating: ``It provides important tax relief which helps offset the costs of acute and chronic medical conditions for older Americans, children, pregnant women, disabled individuals and other adults, as well as the costs associated with long-term care and assisted living.''  At a time when we need to be encouraging Americans to save more for their retirement, I am encouraged that the final agreement preserves the pretax contribution limits for retirement savings plans. We are in the midst of a silent but looming retirement security crisis in this country. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research, there is a $7.7 trillion gap between the savings that American households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement and what they actually have saved.  We should be doing everything we can to encourage more saving, not less. For this reason, I am pleased that the final bill will include my third amendment, which struck the original Senate language eliminating the ability of public employees, such as firefighters, schoolteachers, and police officers, as well as clergy and those employed by charities and nonprofit organizations, to make what are called catch-up contributions to their retirement accounts. These employees are generally paid less than their counterparts employed by for-profit companies and thus are less able to save for their retirement. My provision would allow them to continue making these important extra investments toward a secure retirement.  The conference agreement benefits lower and middle-income taxpayers significantly, while simplifying the tasks that no one relishes of completing their tax returns.  Significantly, this bill nearly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for those filing jointly. The child tax credit will be doubled from $1,000 to $2,000. Thanks to Senator Rubio's efforts, which I strongly supported, up to $1,400 of that tax credit will be refundable in order to benefit low-income families.  Let's be more concrete. What do these reforms mean to families across our country? The 72 percent of Mainers who already use the standard deduction will have their taxes reduced. A family with $24,000 in income will pay no Federal income tax. A single mom earning $35,000 a year with one child will see her taxes drop by nearly 4,000 percent. Instead of paying money back to Washington, she will be getting back nearly $1,100 to help her make ends meet. A couple with no children earning $60,000 will see their taxes fall by more than $900. A couple with two children earning $60,000 will get a tax cut of about $1,700. That is a reduction of more than 100 percent. The bottom line is that most Maine households will see their taxes go down.  I was very concerned about a number of important deductions for individuals that would have been eliminated under the House bill.  Having worked at Husson University in Bangor before my election to the Senate, I am well aware of how critical education deductions and credits are to our students and their families; therefore, I had several fruitful discussions with a key conferee, Senator Rob Portman, about preserving those deductions that help students afford higher education. I appreciate his strong advocacy for these provisions that I care so much about as a result of[[Page S8059]]my direct experience working with college students. In fact, one of the very first bills that I introduced in the Senate as a new Senator in 1997 was to provide a deduction for interest paid on student loans. The conference agreement maintains that deductibility of interest on student loans, as well as the tax exemption for employer-provided tuition assistance and for graduate student tuition waivers. All of those important deductions are maintained in this bill and will help Americans improve their earnings because of the increased education they will have.  The bill also maintains a $250 deduction--a provision I authored some 15 years ago--that allows teachers to deduct the costs of classroom supplies they purchase with their own money. Having visited more than 200 schools in the State of Maine, I know firsthand how dedicated teachers dig deep into their own pockets to buy supplies to enhance the education of their students.  In addition, this bill would modernize the ABLE accounts, which are tax-preferred savings accounts essential for providing long-term support for individuals with disabilities and their families.  The bill also continues the tax credit to encourage adoptions.  The final agreement also preserves a number of deductions and credits that are so important to our communities. I worked hard to preserve the historic tax credit so businesses rehabilitating older buildings in communities like Lewiston, ME, will continue to do so.  I am also pleased that private activity bonds, which are vital to many hospitals and institutions of higher education, are continued, as are the affordable housing and new markets tax credits. We have found proven ways to encourage public-private partnerships, and we ought to continue to incentivize these important partnerships.  How this legislation treats employers has also been the subject of much debate, but the reality is the United States cannot continue to have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world at 35 percent. We are losing jobs as businesses make the calculation to invest overseas.  I have talked to the executives of General Dynamics, which owns Bath Iron Works in Maine and employs more than 5,000 Mainers; to United Technology, which employs more than 1,900 people in North Berwick at its Pratt & Whitney plant; to General Electric, which has a major plant in Bangor; to Proctor & Gamble, which employs 400 workers in Auburn; and to Idexx, which is such an important high-tech employer in Westbrook, about the positive difference this legislation will make in their ability to create jobs in  New Balance, which has about 900 workers in Maine manufacturing footwear, describes the tax reforms as follows: ``New Balance will be more competitive and manufacture more footwear in Maine that we can export across the globe.''  This significant Maine employer went on to say: ``Companies like New Balance, which already has a strong domestic manufacturing presence, will be able to increase investments in their facilities and be more globally competitive while remaining a U.company hiring U.workers.''  These words are echoed by the manager of the Pratt & Whitney plant who wrote to me: ``The reforms . . . will allow companies like ours to bring home earnings from abroad to invest in research and development, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency, and workforce initiatives. . . . Pratt & Whitney plans to hire thousands of people over the next several years across our U.operations, and this tax reform will further support our efforts.''  Isn't that what we seek? Isn't that what tax reform should bring about--more jobs, right here in America?  The bill also includes changes important for our small businesses which employ nearly half of all workers and generate two out of three net new jobs in our country. They are the true engine of our economy, especially in the great State of The bill would provide tax relief that enables them to create more jobs, increase paychecks, and grow our economy.  As the president of the Retail Association of Maine recently commented about this tax reform bill, ``For Maine and its nearly 9,000 retail establishments and the more than 80,000 retail jobs, this is welcome relief for small businesses.''  According to the National Federation of Independent Business, Maine ranks fifth in the Nation for the share of workers employed by passthrough businesses, as most small employers are structured. The NFIB, our Nation's small business advocacy group, has strongly endorsed this final bill.  Small businesses make an outsized contribution to our Nation's economy; yet they face a tax burden that can reach nearly 40 percent at the Federal level and can be significantly higher than the corporate tax rates paid by larger firms. Small businesses are forced to devote more resources to tax payments and fewer resources to creating good jobs and investing in their communities. This bill provides important tax relief to small businesses that are the backbone of our economy.  Let's listen to the words of some of the small businesses from Maine that have written or talked to me. The owner of Windham Millwork, an architectural woodworking company, described the relief for small businesses and how it will help manufacturing workers and families this way: ``Most importantly, it means Windham Millwork will have more money to spend on what matters--our workers and community. With the money we'll save, we can create new jobs or offer better pay to our workforce . . . which helps everyone in our community and contributes to a growing Maine economy.''  The innkeeper of the Nonantum Resort in Kennebunkport noted: ``This tax reform bill helps level the playing field for small businesses not only in the hotel industry, but across the economy. With a lower tax burden, small businesses in all industries can continue to grow, creating more jobs.''  Moreover, a family-owned business in southern Maine described for me how the bill would benefit Maine companies and the people who work for them: ``When [companies] become more profitable, they reinvest faster, grow faster, and increase profit-sharing. Employees benefit when companies grow. There are more jobs, more opportunities, more security, more mobility, more innovation.''  Tax reform should spur this kind of economic growth. The weak growth and stagnant wages we have seen in recent years cannot be accepted as the new normal for our country. It is clear where the current path would lead if we do not act. CBO projects the current slow growth of just 1.9 percent per year will continue throughout the next decade--far below the historic average of 3 percent. This would result in our public debt exceeding 90 percent of GDP by 2027, just as our obligations to the baby boom generation begin to crest.  Surely, we can do better. Tax relief and reform will lift our economy, leading to higher wages for workers and more revenue for government. Extrapolating from a CBO estimate, an increase of just four-tenths of 1 percent in economic growth could produce revenues that are in excess of $1 trillion over the next 10 years.  If we remain on our present trajectory, however, growth will remain stagnant. Continued slow growth will crowd out many funding priorities, harm our national security, place significant strain on Federal programs, and impose a burden on our children and our grandchildren. We must act now to reignite the engine of growth, to provide for the next generation the same promise of a brighter future we received from those who came before us.  Finally, let me discuss the critical issue of healthcare. It has been deeply disturbing to see seniors frightened about the possibility that this tax bill could trigger an automatic 4-percent cut in the vital Medicare Although I knew that the law that could cause this reduction has been waived 16 times, I felt it was essential that our leaders publicly commit that Medicare reductions would not be triggered by this legislation. I don't know of any Senator on either side of the aisle who is seeking to have an automatic 4-percent cut in Medicare go into effect.  I ask unanimous consent that my exchange of correspondence with the Senate majority leader be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.[[Page S8060]]  This pledge is ironclad and, I hope, reassuring to our seniors.  I am also concerned about the inclusion of the repeal of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act as part of this tax bill. I don't think the two issues should have been combined, but let me be very clear: I have never supported the individual mandate. There is a big difference between fining people who choose to go without health insurance versus the bills considered last summer and fall that would have taken away insurance coverage from people who have it and want it. Those bills also would have made sweeping cuts in the Medicaid  The financial penalty under the individual mandate for failing to comply with it falls disproportionately on lower-income Eighty percent of those who pay the fine make under $50,000 a year. For many of these individuals, the cost of insurance under the ACA is simply unaffordable. Individuals making 250 percent of the Federal poverty level--that is just over $30,000--are not eligible for the subsidies to reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that are known as the cost-sharing reductions. So, essentially, the insurance they are being fined for, if they don't buy, is virtually useless to them because the deductibles and the copays are so high, and if they make over 250 percent of the poverty level--over $30,000 a year--they cannot afford it.  I want to make an important point that has been overlooked in this debate. Any Senator, Democratic or Republican, could have offered an amendment on the Senate floor to strike the repeal of the individual mandate. None--not one--chose to do so. That is telling, indeed, and reflects both how unpopular the mandate is and how burdensome its impact is.  Nevertheless, repealing the individual mandate without other healthcare reforms will almost certainly lead to further increases in the costs of health insurance premiums that are already too expensive under the  For these reasons, I have made it a priority to secure passage of two bipartisan bills that will help make health insurance more affordable. Shouldn't that be a goal that all of us can embrace? Both of these bills have the support of the President, the Vice President, and the Senate Republican leaders. In fact, Majority Leader McConnell and I engaged in a colloquy affirming that commitment.  The first bill, the Bipartisan Healthcare Stabilization Act, sponsored by Senators Alexander and Murray, will provide vital funding to help low-income families pay their out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and copays associated with certain ACA health insurance. I am proud to be one of the 22 cosponsors of the bipartisan Alexander-Murray bill.  The second is a bipartisan bill that I introduced with my friend and colleague Senator Bill It would protect people with preexisting conditions while lowering the cost of health insurance through the use of high-risk pools. This plan will provide $5 billion annually for 2 years in seed money for States to establish invisible high-risk pools or traditional reinsurance programs.  We don't have to guess about the impact. I am going to quote some actuarial studies shortly. The fact is that we know from experience in States like Maine and Alaska that high-risk pools can help to lower premiums substantially, by an average of 20 percent.  Analyses show that enactment of these two bills together will reduce the cost of health insurance, thus making it more affordable. According to analysis by experts at Oliver Wyman, the passage of these bills will more than offset the premium increases caused by the repeal of the individual mandate. In fact, Oliver Wyman suggests in its estimate that the $5 billion in funding would be sufficient to allow States to leverage more than $15 billion in reinsurance coverage, and it would result in premiums that were more than 20 percent lower than if the individual mandate were repealed and the package of provisions were not implemented.  Furthermore, analysis by experts at Avalere project that ``in combination, CSR funding and $5B in annual reinsurance could lower 2019 premiums by 18% and increase enrollment by 1.3M people.''  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote that these two bills would significantly reduce health insurance premiums and help promote more stability in insurance markets. The NAIC said: ``Providing reliable federal funding to reimburse health insurance carriers for the Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) program assistance they give to low-income consumers and grants for states to establish invisible high risk pools or reinsurance programs would reduce premium increases as much as 20 percent and could encourage some carriers to stay in the market.''  In evaluating this bill, the question we should ask is not, Does this tax cut make Washington better off? The right question to ask is, Does this tax cut make the American people better off? The answer to that question is yes.  The bill puts money back into the pockets of American taxpayers with tax cuts beginning January 1. As soon as the IRS updates withholding tables this winter, taxpayers will see the benefit of this bill in their paychecks. Over time, Americans will also see more benefit from this legislation in the form of higher wages. Businesses, small and large, will make the investments that will create more jobs.

Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell: I write to express my deep      concerns with the Congressional Budget Office's determination      that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to      be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be      triggered by the passage of tax reform legislation as a      result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though      there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.       Since I do not believe it is anyone's intention to allow      automatic cuts to Medicare to occur, I urge swift action to      waive the PAYGO requirements. Medicare provides essential      benefits to our nation's seniors, and we must remove      immediately the threat that an automatic reduction in the      program's funding could occur.       Since PAYGO was enacted, sixteen laws that would have      otherwise triggered PAYGO's automatic spending cuts have      included provisions to exclude all or part of the law's      budgetary impact, including the American Taxpayer Relief Act      of 2012 that was enacted under the previous       I look forward to working with you to ensure that no      Medicare cuts are triggered under PAYGO, a goal I believe is      supported by members on both sides of the aisle. Thank you      for your attention to this critical issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Susan Collins,     United States                                  ____                                 U.Senate, Majority Leader,                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2017.     Susan Collins,     Washington,       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter expressing      concern about the across-the-board spending cuts. You will be      pleased to know that Speaker Paul Ryan and I issued the      following joint statement earlier today:       ``Critics of tax reform are claiming the legislation would      lead to massive, across-the-board spending cuts in vital      programs--including a 4-percent reduction in Medicare--due to      the Pay-Go law enacted in 2010. This will not happen.      Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,      which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is      no reason to believe that Congress would not act again to      prevent a sequester, and we will work to ensure these      spending cuts are prevented.''       Again, thank you.

964,topic-id,286,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleague from Illinois, Senator Duckworth, in introducing the Promoting Women in the Aviation Workforce Act of 2017. Our bill seeks to encourage and support women pursuing careers in the field of aviation.  As Chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe it is important to help women achieve their professional aspirations across all transportation sectors. Although women make up over 50 percent of our Nation's workforce, they are significantly underrepresented in the aviation industry, representing only two percent of airline mechanics, four percent of flight engineers, five percent of repairmen, six percent of pilots, 18 percent of flight dispatchers, and 26 percent of air traffic controllers.  Our bill expresses the sense of Congress that the aviation industry should explore the possibility of offering opportunities, such as pilot training, STEM education, and mentorship programs, which would help to encourage women to pursue aviation careers from a young age.  In addition, our bill would direct the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to create and manage a Women in Aviation Advisory Board to hold the industry accountable for providing education, training, mentorship, outreach, and recruitment programs that are aimed at women.  Finally, in another effort to improve the availability and quality of educational opportunities for women pursuing careers in aviation, this legislation would require that the FAA submit a report to Congress on current trends concerning women in aviation and the potential for expanding related programming.  Mr.President, I believe this bill will have a positive impact on the workforce supporting one of our country's leading industries. I want to thank Senator Duckworth for partnering with me on this effort, and urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

168,topic-id,1411,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 reflects a bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached between the House and the Senate authorizing committees.  I want to particularly thank our chairman and ranking member and my friend, Senator McCain, for his leadership on this bill in the Senate, in helping us get this agreement today. I note we all appreciate his service as well as his commitment to the service of all those here whom we are working for today.  Fire prevention and safety is literally a matter of life and death. In 2015, there were 1.34 million fires reported in the United States, causing more than 3,000 civilian deaths and 15,000 injuries. In addition to this devastating human loss, fires cost $14.3 billion in property damage.  As I travel throughout my district and visit with firefighters and paramedics, I am constantly reminded of the sacrifices they make to protect our neighbors. Certainly, as we have seen the raging fires in California, that is brought to mind also.  One thing I consistently hear from our volunteer and professional firefighters is how critical these grants are to their stations. Whether they help by providing training for additional firefighters or providing upgraded respirators to ensure their safety, towns and communities around the district are safer as a result of these grants.  Sadly, last year, 69 of our firefighters across the country lost their lives in the line of duty.  Fire prevention has improved dramatically since Congress passed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act in 1974, which created the U.Fire Administration and the National Fire This has certainly professionalized all of this work, but there are still areas for improvement.  Firefighting activities and funding are primarily the responsibility of States and local communities. The USFA and NFA, however, are responsible for national data collection, public education, and research and training programs to reduce fire deaths and make our communities and residents safer, as well as make our firefighters safer.  For the last 15 years, the Federal Government has also awarded competitive grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated emergency medical services, or EMS, organizations to help with a variety of equipment, training, and other needs.  FIRE Act awards provide funding and equipment training to ensure the safety of our Nation's first responders.  SAFER Act awards help local departments to recruit, hire, and retain trained firefighters. Many firefighting departments in my district rely on these grants in order to maintain high-quality fire and emergency services for their communities.  Loudoun County, in particular, received $2 million through this grant program. According to Fire Chief Brower: ``These programs greatly assist localities in the areas of firefighter safety, fire and life safety education, and improved resourcing for tactical fire operations.''  More than 80 people lost their lives in the horrific Grenfell Tower fire in London that occurred earlier this year.  Closer to home, it was just 2 years ago that a Metro fire injured 70 and killed a Virginia resident who was a grandmother of three, who was on her way to work.  California's huge wildfires are in today's headlines and remind us that, as communities continue to expand into wildland areas, wildfires pose growing risk for human life, home and property losses, and entire communities.  When fires occur, first responders run toward the flames and put themselves[[Page H10157]]in danger in order to prevent lives from being lost.  This bill will reauthorize the USFA and the FIRE and SAFER programs for 6 years and ensure that our Nation's firefighters and paramedics have the tools and training they need to fight and prevent devastating fires.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.

950,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.4375, the STEM Research and Education Effectiveness and Transparency Act, contains two provisions aimed at providing better information on how to make taxpayer-funded investments in STEM and research and development more effective, transparent, and fair.  First, the bill requires the National Science Foundation, for the first time, to report and make recommendations to Congress regarding the effectiveness of its research and education programs aimed at broadening the participation of women and historically underrepresented individuals in  This report will give Congress, the National Science Foundation, and other stakeholders objective information about what kinds of interventions and assistance are efficient, scalable, and effective.

According to the Society of Women Engineers, which partnered with the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, women represent only about 15 percent of the engineering workforce.  This is an important issue because studies have found that companies with higher female representation tend to achieve more and have higher profits. According to Catalyst research of Fortune 500 companies, firms with the most female representation showed a 35 percent higher return on equity and 34 percent higher return to shareholders.  Second, the bill requires all Federal science agencies to collect standardized information, including demographics, for each application received for research and development grants. Agencies are to submit the information annually to the National Science Foundation, which is directed to publish an annual statistical summary.  This information will provide better transparency to how taxpayer dollars are spent on research and scientists, who are involved in that research, across the Federal  Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, ",CREC-2017-12-18-pt1-PgH10158.txt,2273,HONORING THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN JOHN YATES,2017.0,18.0,December

547,topic-id,368,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue that is receiving a lot of attention both in the media and in the House Agriculture Committee, and that is our Nation's largest anti-hunger problem, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or  As we approach the upcoming farm bill, I would offer a brief perspective, something that I have been keeping in the front of my mind throughout all of these conversations.  Mr.Speaker, SNAP is about families that are living paycheck to paycheck here in our It is about helping households across this country, not so much worry about where the next meal is coming from, but letting them worry more about their children's education, their own work, and, quite frankly, their own future. It is about helping every citizen realize the American Dream by modernizing a program that helps lift folks out of poverty, rather than trapping them there.  Mr.Speaker, this will not be easy. There will be people who demonize our efforts. Some will even criticize the process. We will have those who paint doomsday scenarios about what we are trying to get done. Some will say it is too much, too soon, and too fast.  Mr.Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Our committee has spent 3 years examining every aspect of this program. We have heard from citizens across this Nation who have been helped by SNAP, and we identified modest improvements that we believe will better serve those in greatest need.[[Page H9851]]  Mr.Speaker, we must get this policy right. As I said, we must get this policy right.  I can tell you, Mr.Speaker, that these reforms are about maintaining the American value of generosity, a generosity that says no American should go to bed hungry each night. But, Mr.Speaker, it also strengthens that great American tradition of self-efficiency that compels us to work to improve our own stations in life.  By doing this, by modernizing SNAP, by making these changes that incentivize work, encouraging collaboration, and promote and improve access, we will be ensuring better nutrition for our American families. And, as budgets tighten in our country and across this government, we will be preserving a program that must be preserved for future generations.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgH9850-3.txt,1805,GUN VIOLENCE,2017.0,13.0,December

717,topic-id,1221,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about the vital importance of the connection between the arts, education, and progress.  I am from a little town in Delaware named Hockessin was not much when I grew up there. We had about 1,500 people, some dairy farms and mushroom farms. Over the last 40 years, it has gradually developed.  A not much widely noted big day happened back in 1994 in Hockessin, DE, when one of America's greatest jazz performers, Cab Calloway, passed away in the little town of Hockessin, Cab Calloway gave his name to a remarkable performing arts school. This is a school that 25 years ago was created dedicated to the idea that if you want to elevate learning, if you want to strengthen education, you should make sure you have a robust range of opportunities to engage with the arts.  I thought I would use that as an example today to talk for a few minutes about why what we do here can be important across our whole country and why a connection between the arts and education can make a lasting difference for families all across our country.  Back in 1965, when I was just 2 years old, a group of Senators, Republican and Democratic, came together to create two things--the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the These two federally funded national programs are absolutely critical educational, economic, and cultural drivers that have impacted thousands of communities across the United  Why is this a subject of any contention or discussion here? Well, because unfortunately our President's budget this year proposed to eliminate funding for both of these organizations--both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities--proposed to be removed, zeroed out, cancelled, despite their almost more than 50-year record of successful impact and service across the country.  In my little State of Delaware, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities funded all sorts of valuable programs with significant impacts. Last year, I invited the head of the National Endowment for the Arts to come and visit us in Delaware and to pull together the whole range of folks who received some grants from them--$681,000 last year. It is about 17 percent of all the funding for arts in my It helped support 100 grants to nonprofits all up and down our  I will give a few examples. The Grand Opera House has a summer in the park series because of the National Endowment for the The University of Delaware Community Music School holds a musical theater camp every summer, serving dozens of kids--about 80 kids. The Christiana Cultural Arts Center in downtown Wilmington brings vibrant, cutting-edge arts programming to a neighborhood that might not otherwise enjoy it. The Creative Vision Factory provides individuals with behavioral health disorders an opportunity for self-expression, empowerment, and recovery through the arts. I[[Page S7995]]can give many more examples, but these are four of the hundreds.  The National Endowment for the Humanities gives a comparable number of grants and supports programs up and down our I will mention one--art conservation at Winterthur, which is a magnificent museum and collection of the American arts, has a partnership with museums in places around the world--from Haiti, to Iraq, to Syria--where, because of conflict, critical pieces of cultural history have been at risk of being lost. Because of these NEH grants to Winterthur, those partnerships have been strengthened.  We have been blessed to have in my friend Governor Jack Markell and his wife Carla, over the last 8 years, strong, longstanding support for the arts in our We have lots of leading individuals in our Tatiana Copeland, for example, helped build the Queen Theater and helped support the Delaware Symphony They work in partnership with the Delaware Division of the A gentleman named Paul Weagraff is now the executive director of the Delaware Division of the Arts under the new administration of Governor  I am hopeful that we here in the Senate can sustain bipartisan support for arts and humanities funding and that the young people of Delaware, our communities, and our families will continue to enjoy the blessings that these investments in creativity bring. How much are we talking about? It is about $150 million--$149.8 million, to be specific--this fiscal year for each of these two endowments. That is a tiny percentage of the total Federal budget. Now, $150 million may sound like a lot, and $680,000 of grants for my whole State of Delaware may sound like a lot, but across these two endowments for the arts and humanities, $300 million in Federal money has a dramatic impact. It leverages private funding 9 to 1. In recent studies looking at the impact of the National Endowment for the Arts, they concluded that they were particularly focused and particularly effective and that where there is a leadership grant given by the NEA, it leverages $9 more for every Federal dollar used.  I think Federal funding for the arts and humanities has to remain a priority. I think it is important that we embrace the model that the Cab Calloway School has championed in Delaware and across the country where educational excellence is shown by working together with the expressive and creative arts.  It was William Butler Yeats--a famous Irish poet--who once said that education is not the mere filling up of a pail, it is the lighting of a fire. If you want to ignite the aspirations, hopes, and dreams of young people, don't just engage them in trigonometry, biology, chemistry, and physics--although those subjects can be interesting, engaging, or challenging--light the fire of their spirit with art, give their spirit room to soar, give them an opportunity to paint on the canvas of their lives, and give them the gift of artistic training and skills, and there is no limit to where they can go. That has been our experience in That has been our experience across the country.  It is my hope that we will find a way on a bipartisan basis to continue to sustain investment in the humanities and the arts.  In 1960, President Kennedy said:       There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy      to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in      the arts.  Citing three important periods in history, he said:       The age of Pericles was also the age of The age of      Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da The      age of Elizabeth was also the age of Shakespeare, and the new      frontier for which I campaign in public life can also be a      new frontier for American art.  It is important that we remember here that the modest amounts of Federal money we invest in the arts bear enormous positive, multiplied benefits to the people of our country and to our place in the world.  I am grateful for all who work in arts education, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis to sustain our Federal investment in the arts and humanities.  I thank the Presiding  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

20,topic-id,2720,"Mr.President, listening to my friend, the Democratic leader, leads me to conclude that he and his party have given up on the American dream. They want to settle for the status quo, which is stagnant growth of our economy and jobs where people haven't seen an increase in their wages for years. They even seem to be rooting for failure. That seems to be the attitude of our missing-in-action congressional Democrats on the Tax Cuts and Jobs  We, on the other hand, think American families need more take-home pay, higher wages, more jobs, and a competitive economy, and we believe they shouldn't have to settle for less. I will come back to that in a moment.  I do want to talk about tax reform and make the perhaps obvious statement that tax reform is hard. That is the reason it hasn't been done since 1986. It is even harder when we have a political party that is determined to fight against every single proposal we have made in our tax cut and tax reform bill, including ones they themselves have championed in the past.  I have heard the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, talk about corporate giveaways, and the Democratic leader just alluded to the same thing. Yet we are embracing the same sort of approach they took in previous proposals and that President Obama advocated for in his State of the Union Address in 2011, when he asked Republicans and Democrats alike to work together to lower the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world because he knew it was chasing jobs overseas, and he knew it was important to bring that investment and those jobs back to the United That is exactly what our bill does.  My friend Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, called tax reform a Rubik's He is right, but now, thankfully, we have figured out how to solve that Rubik's  We confess that this legislation is not perfect, but it is good, and it is much better than the status quo, which our Democratic colleagues seem to have settled for. Last week, the conference committee met between the House and the Senate, and members, including myself, had many difficult conversations about how to reconcile the differences between the two bills. Those discussions were necessary, they were prudent, and they were productive. We now have a consensus about how to get this bill across the finish line and to the President's desk before  We will vote on this final bill after the House does tomorrow--hopefully by tomorrow night. Perhaps it will carry over into Wednesday morning, but we will get it on the President's desk for him to sign into law before Christmas, as we pledged.  I want to talk for just a few moments about why I am so excited at the prospect--and so are so many other people across the country--because oftentimes their words get lost in the chatter, some of which is designed to mislead and presents an inaccurate picture of just how consequential this tax reform will be. Their voices--those who believe this good bill will help them--deserve to be heard.  Let me first talk about manufacturing. There was a survey released last week that showed historically high optimism among 14,000 small and large employers in the manufacturing sector. How long have we heard that we need to bring manufacturing back to the United States rather than outsourcing it to Mexico or China or other places around the world? Well, we tried to address that, and I think we met with some success because more than 94 percent of manufacturers are now positive about their company's outlook. Nearly 64 percent said that tax reform would encourage their company to increase capital spending. Capital spending is what goes into infrastructure, equipment, and things that allow them to become more productive and to create more jobs. A majority of these manufacturers said that they would indeed expand their businesses and they would hire more workers after this bill is signed into law by the In fact, manufacturers predict that the number of jobs could surge to 2 million by the year 2025. Now there are roughly 350,000 American manufacturing jobs, so a leap to 2 million is almost fantastic--hard to contemplate--but very exciting if true.  The second group I want to mention that is very excited about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is small businesses. We know small businesses are the economic engine of the country. Indeed, 70 percent of new jobs are created not by Fortune 500 company businesses but by small businesses. As one piece in the Houston Chronicle recently pointed out, the 2.6 million small businesses that call Texas home are enthusiastic because tax reform will provide them much needed relief.  Small businesses, of course, all have to pay taxes, which is burdensome enough, but they also have to spend hours and money to comply with our unnecessarily complex tax laws. According to a 2017 survey by the National Small Business Association, 58 percent of small businesses reported that the administrative burden of Federal taxes posed a greater challenge than the cost of the taxes themselves. The burden of compliance was worse than the check they had to write to the[[Page S8055]]Federal The Houston op-ed put the matter succinctly. It said:       For large corporations that can afford a small army of      lawyers and accountants, the tax laws are a nuisance. For      small businesses, they are a nightmare.  Now that situation will change. Our bill will simplify the Tax Code by eliminating many special deductions and credits while broadening the base and bringing down rates.  To those cynics here inside the beltway who roll their eyes, who think that changes to the business provisions of the code don't matter, I would point out two more important pieces of news. First, the Federal Reserve, an independent government institution, recently said that this tax package is one of the factors that led them to increase their projections for growth next year. That is welcome, to say the least. Tax reform, said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, last appointed by President Obama, will boost spending and could do the same for productivity. So the Federal Reserve has raised its growth projections for next year, particularly in response to what we are doing.  For those who worry about deficits--that we are cutting taxes too much--and who don't believe the economy will grow to compensate for those cuts in taxes, all they need to do is look at the projection of the Federal They currently project the economy to grow at 2.1 percent, but she said that next year it could go to 2.5 percent. So even if you believe that very conservative estimate, that is enough growth to compensate for the cut in taxes and the loss of revenue next year, but we expect that will continue and will grow over the next 10 years.  It is another thing to note how the rest of the world is reacting to what we are doing here. To name but one example, China is worried, which should tell us something. According to a Wall Street Journal story printed last week, China sees these tax plans as making the United States a much more attractive place to invest, which means less investment will occur in One official in Beijing has called our tax plan a huge and imminent danger that can't be ignored. China is worried that job creators will relocate here in America, which is a well-founded concern and one of the goals of this tax bill. That is exactly what they will do when we lower the corporate rate and go to a territorial system. Rather than taxing these businesses twice and encouraging them to keep the money they earn and the jobs they create overseas, we encourage them to bring them back to America by making our businesses more internationally competitive.  So to summarize what we are seeing already, and we haven't even passed the bill yet--the conference report, at least--we have passed the Senate bill, the House bill, and now the conference report, which is the reconciled version between the House and the Senate versions, was released  To summarize what we have seen already, nationally, manufacturers are raving about the tax plan. In places like Texas, small businesses desperately need the relief this bill offers. The Federal Reserve, an independent financial body of the Federal Government, has increased their growth estimates, in part, based upon the tax relief provided in this bill. And our chief competitor in the global economy is startled by what we are doing and afraid of what it might mean in terms of America's competitiveness globally.  Put all this together and what do you have? A brief snapshot of the huge economic impact of the tax overhaul that will be signed by the President in the next few days. Signs of that impact are all around us, almost everywhere I look.  I know of at least one major airline--Southwest Airlines--that has already announced big plans as to what they plan to do with their tax savings. With the benefits afforded by this tax reform, they said that they will purchase new aircraft. Well, this means more jobs for the people who build those aircraft. It means more jobs for the pilots and the flight attendants who travel on them. It means better customer experiences, and it may even mean lower fares for consumers.  Let's talk about what this bill does for Americans who get up and go to work every day and just try to eke out a living, providing for their families. Well, I will tell you, for those worried about how tax reform will affect real people's actual lives, let me give you a couple of concrete examples. Let's take a single teacher making $50,000 a year. She will see a significant reduction in her tax burden--between 17 and 20 percent--less taxes that she will have to pay. This comes from a lower marginal rate and a higher standard deduction. How about a married couple with three children and with median earnings of $75,000 a year? Well, their tax bill will decrease, as well, by as much as $2,000 from a lower rate and a higher child tax credit.  As I have said before, maybe some of our Democratic friends don't believe this is a big deal; maybe they don't care about those American families living paycheck to paycheck, who would welcome an additional $2,000 each year. Their actions make me think they are OK with the status quo because they have refused to even participate in the process, and they have been rooting for failure every step along the way.  Well, we saw the latest example of this over the weekend when a leftwing website, masquerading as a legitimate news outlet, led by a former staffer of the junior Senator from Vermont, published what it advertised as a breaking news story about the final bill. This story breathlessly claimed, without a shred of evidence, that a provision had been airdropped into the final draft in secret in order to secure the vote of a Member who would supposedly personally benefit from it. This is a salacious tale from beginning to end. It was also completely false and invented.  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have joined with my colleagues over the last year to investigate the efforts of Russian intelligence operatives to undermine public confidence in our last elections. Well, the way this phony news story broke and was picked up on social media and in the mainstream media would make a Russian intelligence officer proud. The whole purpose of this exercise--this false and invented story--was to undermine public confidence in this tax reform package that we will pass, perhaps as early as tomorrow, to be signed by the President, perhaps before  Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle and their allies in the so-called mainstream media ran with it in a dishonest attempt to derail us from passing the bill and undermine the reputation or integrity of one of our fellow Senators--all from a made-up story. Again, the Russian intelligence officials--it is well-documented by now--through a combination of cyber theft, propaganda, creative use of social media, and a gullible mainstream media, undermined American confidence in our most basic obligation, an institution of our government, which is our election system. But what we saw happen this weekend, as I said, would have made a Russian intelligence officer proud.  As a letter from Chairman Hatch, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, makes clear today, this website, which, by the way, also posted a false report about an amendment I had introduced several weeks ago and later had to correct it, spread a false story irresponsibly and dishonestly. In his letter, Chairman Hatch writes:       It takes a great deal of imagination--and likely no small      amount of partisanship--to argue that a provision that has      been public for over a month, debated on the floor of the      House of Representatives, included in a House-passed bill,      and identified by [the Joint Committee on Taxation] as an      issue requiring compromise between conferees is somehow a      covert and last-minute addition to the conference report.  It reminds me of another quote sometimes attributed to Mark Twain, perhaps apocryphally, who supposedly said: A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes. Well, a lie can travel even faster than that today because of social media.  Shame on those who would perpetuate lies in an effort to deny the American people a much needed tax cut and tax relief. Thank goodness that attitude isn't shared by most Americans and by the Texans I represent who want and deserve much better than the same old same old. They don't believe we have to settle for the status quo. We are going to give them something better. We are going to keep our promise, and I can't wait until this bill gets on the President's desk.  Let me just close by saying that I am a proud son of a World War II veteran.[[Page S8056]]My dad was in the Army Air Corps, flew B-17s out of Molesworth Air Force Base in England over Nazi Germany during the end of World War He was a member of the 8th Air Force, 303rd Bomb On his 26th mission, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war. Thank goodness he survived, came home, met my mom, married, raised a family, and became a productive member of civilian society after his military service. But I remember, as if it were yesterday, what my parents said they wanted for me, my brother, and my sister. It is what parents of that entire generation wanted for their children and grandchildren. They wanted to know that their sacrifice, their willingness to fight and win America's wars against terrible tyrants, such as Adolph Hitler--that the consequence of their sacrifice and their service would be a better standard of living, a safer world, and a better quality of life. In short, what they wanted for us and what I want for my children and what I believe every American parent wants for their child or their children is exactly what my parents wanted for me and my sister and my brother. We sometimes call that the American dream.  Some of us believe that the American dream is still alive, that we don't have to settle for second place. We don't have to settle for the status quo. We don't have to settle for flat wages and fewer jobs. We can do better. We believe we have done better in this piece of legislation, which will help reawaken the slumbering giant of the American economy. It will put Americans back to work. It will mean more take-home pay. It will mean a better standard of living, but, surprisingly--and disappointingly--our colleagues across the aisle want no part of it. I hope they haven't given up on that American dream. I haven't given up, and I don't believe Americans have given up on that dream.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Bob Corker,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Corker: Thank you for your letter dated      yesterday.       I am disgusted by press reports that have distorted one      particular aspect of the conference agreement on H.1, the      Tax Cuts and Jobs The reports have focused on the final      version of the 20 percent pass-through deduction, the      proposed new Section 199As the author of this provision      and the vice chairman of the conference committee, I can      speak with authority about the process by which the      conference committee reached its final position.       There are two false assertions contained in these reports,      and I would like to correct the record on both.       First, some have asserted that a new provision was crafted      for real estate developers and was ``airdropped'' into the      conference agreement. Second, reports have implied that you      had some role in advocating for or negotiating the inclusion      of this provision.       Both assertions are categorically false. With respect to      the second, I am unaware of any attempt by you or your staff      to contact anyone on the conference committee regarding this      provision or any related policy matter. To the contrary,      virtually all the concerns you had raised in the past about      the treatment of pass-through businesses in tax reform were      to voice skepticism about the generosity of various proposals      under consideration.       The first claim--that a new pass-through proposal was      created out of whole cloth and inserted into the conference      report--is an irresponsible and partisan assertion that is      belied by the facts. For more than a year, tax-writers in the      House and Senate have worked to craft legislation that not      only provided relief for ``C'' corporations, but also      delivered equitable treatment for pass-through businesses.      Though the two chambers came at this issue from different      angles, our goal was the same: To provide tax relief to pass-     through businesses at a level similar to that provided to      regular ``C'' corporations. This policy goal was confirmed in      the Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code, which      provided in part:       ``TAX RATE STRUCTURE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES The framework      limits the maximum tax rate applied to the business income of      small and family owned businesses conducted as sole      proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations to 25%. The      framework contemplates that the committees will adopt      measures to prevent the re-characterization of personal      income into business income to prevent wealthy individuals      from avoiding the top personal tax rate.''       The House Ways Means Committee and the Senate Finance      Committee achieved this mutual goal by different means.      Section 1004 of the House bill provided a special tax rate      for pass-through income and included a ``prove-out'' option      for capital-intensive businesses. Chairman Brady unveiled      this approach on November 2nd, more than six weeks ago.       The Senate took a different approach, achieving the      intended rate relief through a deduction patterned after      current law Section 199. We also included measures to ensure      that compensation could not be easily gamed into business      income in order to qualify for the deduction. Similar to      Section 199, the deduction in the Senate bill excluded      compensation and guarantee payments to owners and was limited      to 50 percent of compensation paid to employees, with an      exception for small pass-through businesses, including      service providers. The Senate bill did not include a prove-     out option for capital-intensive businesses like the one      contained in the House bill.       The Joint Committee on Taxation (``JCT''), the non-partisan      congressional scorekeeper for tax legislation, released a      side-by-side summary of the two bills for conferees. That      summary, dated December 7, 2017 and available on JCT's      website (JCX 64-17), described the House position in part:       ``In the case of a capital-intensive business, a taxpayer      may ``prove out'' a capital percentage by electing the      application of an increased percentage for the taxable year      it is made and each of the next four taxable years. The      applicable percentage is determined by dividing (1) the      specified return on capital for the activity for the taxable      year, by (2) the taxpayer's net business income derived from      that activity for that taxable year.''       It takes a great deal of imagination--and likely no small      amount of partisanship--to argue that a provision that has      been public for over a month, debated on the floor of the      House of Representatives, included in a House-passed bill,      and identified by JCT as an issue requiring a compromise      between conferees is somehow a covert and last-minute      addition to the conference report.       I have sat on a number conference committees, too numerous      to remember. In each case, conferees have come into the      conference expecting to achieve their chamber's position or      negotiate a reasonable compromise. This conference committee      was no exception. The House entered the conference with an      interest in preserving, in some form, the prove-out      alternative as an option for capital-intensive taxpayers.      Through several rounds of negotiations, the House secured a      version of their proposal that was consistent with the      overall structure of the compromise.       The prove-out alternative included in the conference report      was derived from the House provision and is the product of a      negotiation between the House and Senate tax-writing      committees. It is that simple.       If you have any further questions, please feel free to      contact me.

Since dictator Kim Jong Un took power 6 years ago, he has ordered at least four nuclear tests, including the September detonation of what his regime and outside experts generally agree was a hydrogen bomb.  Despite great efforts made by the United States, including a recent Executive order by our President, North Korea's history as a bad-faith negotiator continues unabated on the world's stage. It obstinately violates diplomatic norms and human rights at will and was recently redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism.  We simply can't afford to wander naively down a path of appeasement when lessons learned over more than half a century have laid bear North Korea's behavioral patterns. They have exposed the regime's militant refusal to cooperate with the world community and simply denuclearize.  Our resolution asserts that the United States, as well as the United Nations Security Council and our regional allies, should continue to implement the strictest of sanctions regime possible required to change the bad behavior of North  Further, we have to continue to exhaust every reasonable diplomatic option to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic programs. Our resolution recognizes that the President has constitutional responsibilities to protect the United States, but it emphasizes that a congressional authorization is necessary prior to committing U.forces to sustain military operations on the Korean  Of course, we hope that the worst outcome--open military conflict--will never come to pass, but, as it continues to increase its nuclear yield and ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has become one of, if not the single, greatest threat to peace in the world.  As the resolution makes clear, the United States must continue to take all necessary precautions through a mix of diplomacy, economic sanctions, and contingency planning. Our focus should be on exerting as much pressure as we can on North Korea to end its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs.  I hope our colleagues will join us in adopting this resolution in short order to send a very important and clear message about the gravity of the threat and the severity with which we are confronting it.[[Page S8049]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgS8047-2.txt,1692,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,14.0,December

294,topic-id,2404,"Mr.President, I approach this topic with a little bit of trepidation. Ordinarily when people make outrageous, outlandish, and unbelievable statements, I usually think it is best just to let them go because when people make these kinds of statements, I think they lose their own credibility, and maybe it doesn't bear any particular comment by anybody else or a desire or an attempt to refute it. But on the subject of tax reform, there have been some incredible statements that have been made, and I am going to mention a few of those because I think they really paint an ugly picture of what is supposed to be a debate on tax reform policy, but I think probably they relate more to sort of the nature of what passes for debate here in Washington, DC--and particularly the Congress--on matters of important public policy. In other words, there isn't a lot of debate. There is accusation after accusation. It gets repeated on social media, then the press picks it up, and then people just assume, well, it must be true since nobody has ever denied it or offered any contrary narrative.  For example, the House minority leader apparently had the time to read every bill that has ever been written since the year 1789 because she felt comfortable calling this tax bill, which is still in the process of being written--reconciling the House and Senate versions--she called it the ``worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.'' She has been busy if she has read every bill since 1789. Then she went further because that apparently wasn't enough for her. She said that our tax bill isn't just poor legislation; she said that it is an existential threat to the Nation and possibly the entire planet. Can you believe that? An existential threat to the Nation and possibly the entire planet.[[Page S7953]]  Well, you can see why perhaps I was reluctant to come address these accusations, because I think anybody who would make those kinds of accusations has lost all credibility. But acting either as a prophet or an amateur astrologist--we are not quite sure--she called the prospect of passing tax reform ``Armageddon.''  Well, it is hard to know what to say or do in the face of that sort of rhetoric because, frankly, this tax reform bill is a good thing. I wish our friends across the aisle, the Democrats, would join us in trying to make it better. That is what happened the last time we tried to do this or this Congress tried to do it.  In 1986, a Republican President; a Democratic Senator from New Jersey, Senator Bill Bradley; Dan Rostenkowski from Chicago, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, a Democrat; and other Members of Congress came together to try to reform our Tax Code, and they were successful in doing it against all odds.  But today, we have an entirely different scenario. We have Republicans seeing that the economy is growing at a very slow rate and that wages for most workers have been flat for the last 10 years and realizing that our current Tax Code is counterproductive when it comes to encouraging investment, job creation, and wage growth in our country because we have the highest tax rate in the world for businesses that do business internationally. We thought, we need to do something about it, and so we set about reforming our Tax Code with three goals in mind.  One is to simplify the Tax Everybody knows how complex it is and how much money people spend hiring an accountant or H&R Block or somebody to help them figure it out. Secondly, we figured that it would be important to give hard-working families a tax cut. So we have succeeded in reducing the tax break for every tax bracket in the Tax Code for working families. For example, for low-income families, we have a zero tax bracket now. For a joint-filing husband and wife, on the first $24,000 they earn, there is no tax at all. And thanks to some great work by Senator Rubio and Senator Lee, we have doubled the child tax credit. Those are good things. We have doubled the standard deduction--so fewer people have to itemize deductions to get the full benefit of the code--while maintaining the charitable deduction and the mortgage interest deduction and popular items like that. We have also said, for example, that a family earning roughly $70,000 a year--the median income in America for a family of four--would see a benefit of roughly $2,200 less tax liability.  I would think those would be good things that our friends across the aisle would want to work with us on. How do we simplify the code? How do we let people keep more of what they earn, more take-home pay, a better standard of living? How do we make America's economy more competitive since we have the highest tax rate in the world and we are seeing investment in businesses flee to other lower tax jurisdictions? You would think those would be the sorts of things on which our friends across the aisle would want to work with us but apparently not. Instead, what we get are these sort of reckless and really buffoonish allegations that cause the speaker to lose all credibility in any sort of debate we might be having.  Unfortunately, the media tends to pick up on some of this rhetoric and jump on the bandwagon, but the media's worst claims are at least a little closer to Earth than what I recounted earlier. For example, the Washington Post said the tax reform ``took place behind closed doors.'' Well, that is a tired old rhetoric and talking point. You would think the Washington Post could come up with something a little better than that and actually something that is a little more accurate than that. One columnist at the New York Times sighs that the package benefits donors at the expense of voters--what does that mean?--and that it ``only modestly addresses the central socioeconomic challenge of our time.'' Well, I wonder what this reporter or columnist for the New York Times thinks is the central socioeconomic challenge of our time. I think one of those is for people to be able to pursue the American dream, to be able to find work, to be paid a decent wage, and to be able to keep more of what they earn, but that apparently isn't good enough for this columnist at the New York  Certainly, these charges deserve a little more attention than the minority leader's asteroid attack, but they, too, are misguided.  When it comes to tax reform, the drafting process did not take place behind closed doors. I wonder why the Washington Post was so ill-informed and ignorant of the legislative process that they didn't see the 70 Senate hearings we have had on tax reform since 2011. They apparently didn't bother to turn on C-SPAN to see the debate and the amendment process in the Senate Finance Committee that produced the Senate bill, and they apparently are not paying much attention to what we are talking about here on the Senate floor as we are trying to reconcile the differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. So I guess they are just not paying much attention, which I thought newspapers and reporters were supposed to do.  The second major allegation--that we are ignoring working Americans and the middle class--is demonstrably false.  Many are wondering why tax cuts for families are temporary and the ones for corporations are permanent. Well, we know that businesses need long-term assurances about the tax environment so that they will invest and make plans. We wanted to make tax cuts for individuals permanent, too, but that requires 60 votes in the Senate, and every single one of our Democratic colleagues voted against the bill and they refused to participate in the process. So with only 52 votes to work with, we were unable to meet that 60-vote threshold. So on the one hand, they criticize us for not making those tax cuts for individuals permanent, but then they deny us the votes we need in order to make that happen. It is not that we don't want to make these tax cuts permanent for the middle class; it is that the Democrats are preventing us from doing so.  I agree with my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Florida, Mr.Rubio, who has said that when it comes to debating tax reform, Republicans can't be the country club party. I certainly agree that is not who we are, but that is also not who we should be helping in this bill. We ought to be addressing low-income and middle-class Americans first.  Yes, we do lower the corporate rate, but historically that has been something Democrats have called for. I remember that in 2011, President Obama, in a joint session of Congress, called for reducing the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and he called upon Republicans and Democrats to work together to make that happen. And we have had others, like the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator from Oregon, Mr.Wyden, who cosponsored a bill that would have reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 24 percent. We do a little better than that in this bill. We take it down to 20 percent, which is close to the industrialized world average on tax rates, but the Senator from New York, the Democratic leader, has also called for lowering the corporate tax rate and making us more competitive in the global economy. Do you know what will happen when we do that? We will see investment come back to the United States, along with the jobs that go along with it. Who will benefit from that? Will the businesses that create those jobs benefit? I suppose they will, but the people who will really benefit will be the people who perform those jobs and who earn those wages: hard-working American families.  A group of nearly 140 economists say that, on balance, they believe the bill will enhance economic efficiency and result in most households enjoying lower marginal rates. That is economics talk for tax cuts. But what about fairness and simplification? Don't we all want a fairer tax code and one that is easier to navigate? I believe, once again, our bill delivers.  Those economists I mentioned say fairness would be served by reduction differences, and the tax treatment of individuals with similar incomes and simplification would be served by reducing the number of individuals who itemize for Federal tax purposes. That is exactly what we do by doubling the standard deduction.[[Page S7954]]  Right now, about 3 out of 10 individual taxpayers itemize. Under our doubling the standard deduction, only 1 out of 10 will find it necessary to itemize.  The simple truth is, the Senate bill will lower tax bills on millions of working-class It will lower taxes, not raise them, on the working class. Again, by nearly doubling the standard deduction and lowering rates across the board and doubling the child tax credit, the Senate tax reform plan will lower taxes for every income group. The Senate tax plan was written with working families in mind, and the legislation reflects that goal.  As I said earlier, and I will say it again, a family of four earning a median income of about $70,000 will see a $2,200 savings in their tax bill each year. It may be easy for folks living in the rarified air in Washington, DC, to shrug that off and say $2,200 is no big deal to me, but to the people I represent, $2,200 in tax savings a year is a big deal. It can mean the difference between being able to save for retirement, help pay for a college education, or maybe take a vacation for the first time in a long time. That is the money they have earned, and we are simply saying you can keep more of it under this bill.  Finally, I want to mention the Federal deficit. Will the tax bill increase it? Well, yesterday the Office of Tax Policy at the Treasury Department released an analysis of expected tax revenue associated with the administration's economic growth initiatives. Among the key findings is, $1.8 trillion of additional revenue would be generated over 10 years based on expected economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office uses the baseline of 1.9-percent economic growth. That is because, during the entire Obama Presidency, the U.Government and economy experienced an unprecedented low rate of economic growth since the Great Recession of 2008, but, historically, dating back to World War II, we have seen the economy grow at 3.2 percent. So why should we settle for 1.9 percent or 2 percent? We shouldn't.  Our friends on the other side have suddenly become deficit hawks after seeing the national debt double during the Obama administration. Let's not forget, they supported lowering these same corporate tax rates year after year and embraced other parts of our plan which we have incorporated. That is why their attacks, their histrionics, their screams of Armageddon are laughable, and, frankly, they insult the intelligence of Americans who are trying to figure this out. It is hard to figure out what is actually happening when you have somebody crying like Chicken Little that the sky is falling. It is hard for people to sort all of this out.  Well, as we continue to work on a conference committee report to reconcile the differences between the House and the Senate versions of the bill, our focus will be on those hard-working American families I mentioned earlier--people of modest income, people of average income.  Yes, we are going to make our businesses more competitive globally because that will benefit the same families we are trying to benefit by the individual tax cuts.  You can see why I perhaps was a little reluctant to come address some of these histrionics and outlandish and unbelievable claims, but I have also learned that if you don't respond--if you don't counter falsehood with truth--some people are simply going to believe the falsehood, so I thought it was important to do so. Let's remain clear-eyed, and let's get this work done.  I yield the floor.

Yesterday afternoon, we confirmed Justice Don Willett, who currently serves on the Texas Supreme Court, who has been nominated by President Trump to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Soon we will be voting on Jim Ho, the former solicitor general of the State of Texas, who has also been nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of  These are two outstanding nominees, and they reflect the best of They are each fathers, lawyers, scholars, public servants, and active participants in their communities. I wish to take just a few minutes to discuss each of their unique stories, as well as their sterling records of professional accomplishment.  Don Willett was raised in Talty, a small town outside of Dallas, He was adopted at a young age and raised by a single mom for most of his life. She must have been one heck of a lady because her son went on to achieve great things from those humble beginnings.  He attended Baylor for undergraduate and Duke Law He clerked on the same court to which he has been nominated and now confirmed, the Fifth Circuit Court of He worked in private practice and served Governor, and then President, George  That is not all, though. He went on to work at the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Policy and later served as deputy attorney general of Texas before his appointment to the Texas Supreme He was elected to his first full term in 2006 and reelected in 2012.  While serving on my State's highest court, Justice Willett was recognized for his excellence by the Texas Review of Law and Politics, which named him as its ``Distinguished Jurist of the Year'' in 2014.  Justice Willett's confirmation now is good news, and, perhaps, the best news for him personally is that he will no longer have to run for election, as he has had to do as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, because, of course, his appointment now is for life tenure.  Jim Ho's story is no less remarkable. Jim was born in Taiwan, and his parents immigrated to New York when he was a toddler. Jim learned English by watching Sesame  When he was young, his parents moved to California, where Jim later attended Stanford before moving on to law school at the University of As an adult, in his professional life, Jim clerked for Judge Jerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit, the court to which he has now been nominated and will be confirmed, and he later clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.Supreme  Jim has worked in a variety of legal capacities in the private sector. He has also served at the Civil Rights Division and the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of  It is when he was at the Civil Rights Division that I first met Jim and I offered him a job on my Judiciary Committee staff, where he served as my chief counsel. Later, serving as solicitor general, he had the highest win rate before the U.Supreme Court of any person who has served in that role. When I was attorney general of Texas, we created this position of solicitor general because we had line lawyers who would, literally, handle cases for State agencies and who would handle those cases all the way to the Supreme Court, but really they didn't have the experience or training as an appellate advocate that we needed to speak with a single voice for the entire State before the Federal courts. Jim held that role and performed with distinction. As I said, he was enormously successful in his appellate advocacy.  Jim also bears the distinction as the first Asian-American solicitor general of Texas, and he has taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas and is published in numerous scholarly journals.  Simply put, Jim Ho and Don Willett are two stars in the Texas legal firmament. They were extensively vetted by the bipartisan Texas Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee, appointed by Senator Cruz and myself, as well as the Office of White House Counsel and the Department of I am glad we are now elevating them to the Federal bench.

721,topic-id,1391,"Mr.President, a month ago, we lost another Medal of Honor recipient, CAPT Thomas Hudner, who died at the ripe old age of 93. Not long after, we lost a second one, Wesley Fox, who died at the distinguished age of 86. These are two different men who led two different lives, each equally deserving of praise and honor. Still, I can't help but wonder if there is a reason their deaths came so suddenly and close together. It is almost as if our Lord took them in one fell swoop so the greater loss would inspire greater gratitude for their sacrifice.  What Captain Hudner of the U.Navy did to earn his medal is remarkable for the simple fact that he could have been court-martialed for doing it. It was December 1950 in Just days before, the Chinese People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yalu River and thrown back U.forces on the cusp of victory. Then-Lieutenant Hudner was a naval aviator flying one of six Navy Corsairs near the Chosin Reservoir, 5 miles behind enemy lines, when he saw his squadron mate, ENS Jesse Brown, get hit by enemy fire and crash-land on a snowy mountainside.  What Lieutenant Hudner probably should have done is stick to the plan. What he did instead was an act of pure bravery. He intentionally crash-landed his plane not far from Ensign Brown's, tried to rescue him from the burning wreckage--all in subzero temperatures--but Ensign Brown was trapped. His knee was crushed between the fuselage and the control panel. When help arrived, their hatchet couldn't hack through the plane's metal, and no one could get close enough to amputate his leg. They had to leave him behind. Ensign Brown's last words were: ``Tell Daisy I love her.''  It might be appropriate to note here that Ensign Brown was Black and Lieutenant Hudner was White, but I mention it almost as an afterthought because to the two of them, that is just what it was--a postscript, an addendum, a mere detail. They were comrades in arms, wearing the red, white, and blue, not seeing the color of each other's skin. The only color that mattered to them, and that they shared in common, besides the color of our flag, was the navy blue of their uniform. Just 2 years after Harry Truman had integrated the Armed Forces, Lieutenant Hudner and Ensign Brown's friendship was a symbol of America's promise. He went on to have a successful career, but for giving us a moral example from that day, we should all be thankful.  Colonel Fox, meanwhile, was a legend in the Marine He served for 43 years, leaving only when forced to by mandatory retirement at the age of 62. In that time, he held every enlisted rank except sergeant major and every officer rank except for general. He once admitted:       My first four years as a Marine I didn't own one stitch of      civilian clothes--everything I did was in a Marine uniform.      I'd go home on leave, working in the hay fields or whatever,      I wore my Marine utilities. Go in town to see the movies, I      wore my Marine dress.  That is just how proud Wesley Fox was to be a marine, and it was that deeply felt love for his fellow marines that drove him in his service. Like Lieutenant Hudner, he fought in In fact, he was wounded, and after he recovered, he was so eager to get back to the fight that he wrote to the commandant asking to be deployed once again.  The battle that earned him his place in history was in the jungles of It was February 1969, deep in the A Shau Valley in Then-First Lieutenant Fox was fighting in the last major Marine offensive of the war--Operation Dewey His unit was Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 9th It earned the nickname ``The Walking Dead'' for suffering so many casualties during the war. They came under heavy fire from a larger force. Yet the fearless Lieutenant Fox led a charge against the enemy. He was wounded but refused medical attention, instead concentrating on leading the attack, coordinating air support, and supervising the evacuation of the dead and injured.  It was a stunning show of valor, and for it, he, too, would earn the Medal of His citation read, in part:       His indomitable courage, inspiring initiative and      unwavering devotion to duty in the face of grave personal      danger inspired his Marines to such aggressive action that      they overcame all enemy resistance and destroyed a large      bunker complex. Captain Fox's heroic actions reflect great      credit upon himself and the Marine Corps, and uphold the      highest traditions of the U.Naval  As I said, these were two different men and two different stories but the same courage and service to the same great country. They showed the same selflessness--one risking his life for his friend and the other risking his life for his marines. So I think it is fitting that we celebrate their lives together because they both showed us the utter selflessness of courage. They didn't fight and display such bravery because they hated our enemies but because they loved our country, and they loved their comrades in arms. It is a good lesson, I would say, for this time of year.  So I want to honor the memory of CAPT Thomas Hudner and Wesley They were true American patriots, and may they rest in peace.                       Remembering Thomas Galyon  Mr.President, last year, I stood on this floor and said a few words about a fellow Arkansan: Thomas Galyon of We had just met to discuss his work with the Arkansas chapter of the National ALS He had been diagnosed with ALS in 2014, and never one to let the grass grow under his feet, he had been a tireless advocate for ALS research ever since then.  Well, I am sorry to report that Tom died last month on November 22. He lived 3 years after his diagnosis, which is about average these days for people with With his death, the National ALS Association lost one of its great champions.  Tom was always bursting with energy. He was born in 1946 in Abingdon, VA, and he graduated from Emory & Henry He spent 33 years in the tourism industry, and after a rather brief and, I must say, failed stint in retirement, he went back to work as the property manager for the Center for Nonprofits at Mary's in Northwest As luck would have it, the ALS Association was headquartered in that very building, so he could give both organizations his all.[[Page S7997]]  When we met last year, Tom asked me to help fix a problem that people with ALS have when applying for disability insurance. There is a 5-month waiting period to receive benefits, you see. Though that might be a prudent anti-fraud measure in many cases, for people with ALS, it consumes a lot of their remaining time in this world. So I joined with Senator Whitehouse to sponsor the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, which would waive the waiting period for people with Tom's death should be a reminder of the urgent need to defeat this disease and to finally pass this bill into law. It is the least we can do to commemorate a man who gave this effort so much because, even in death, Tom's commitment was complete. By his request, his brain and spinal cord were donated to the Brain Bank of Miami, FL, to continue the search for a cure for It is not hard to understand why.  He himself used to stress the positive in every situation. His motto was ``Blue skies always,'' and he certainly did all he could to bring blue skies into his life and the lives of those around him.  So now that he has joined our Heavenly Father in the blue skies, I want to recognize him and the family he leaves behind: His wife of 44 years, Sally Armstrong, their two children, and their two grandchildren.  Our State is better off for Tom having lived in it, and all of us are better off for having known him. May he rest in peace.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

93,topic-id,881,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in appreciation of the sentiment that is expressed in the resolution. However, I just feel that the content of this resolution, if it is examined closely, particularly in juxtaposition with the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was the K-12 reauthorization signed into law almost exactly 2 years ago on December 10, 2015, a bipartisanship measure--Congressman Kline, who was the Republican chairman of the House Education Committee, was at the White House with his counterparts from the Senate at the bill-signing ceremony--if people go back and read that, they will see that actually the road map and the pathway to achieve the goal of this resolution was actually laid out by folks from both sides of the aisle in terms of boosting authorized funding for K-12, particularly for low-income students, raising the authorizing for title I schools, which has been the workhorse of the Federal Government in terms of trying to help target resources for kids who come from distressed sectors and areas in terms of urban areas and rural areas, and also had many voluntary permissive authorizations for  Now, if anything, this resolution understates the scope of the demand that is out there for computer science and for STEM skills. There is not a sector in the American economy, from agriculture, where the gentleman comes from in Kansas, farmers are out there using STEM skills every single day in terms of food production. It exists in manufacturing.  I come from a district that is a shipbuilding district. We are in the process of boosting submarine production up in Groton, The metal trades workers are out there using computer[[Page H10153]]skills on the shop floors to make sure that that precision manufacturing happens accurately.  Certainly, financial services up in Hartford, Connecticut, the home of insurance companies like Travelers and The Hartford, they just started a couple years ago the Insurance and Finance Academy, which is a magnet school that brings in Travelers, Smith Barney, and The Hartford to collaborate with the public school system to make sure that kids, particularly low-income kids, from Hartford, Connecticut, are getting the opportunity to learn about things like finance, banking--giving them those skills--which are intrinsically connected to computer science.  Mr.Speaker, the fact of the matter is that there is great appetite in the private sector for public-private partnerships. I would stipulate to that and again argue that, in fact, the resolution almost understates what is out there.  What is missing is the public investment, which ESSA authorized, whether it was title I, whether it is funding to boost teaching skills in the STEM area. We try to give permissive authority to school districts to find math teachers, science teachers, computer science teachers, engineering folks and their curriculum, which every school district is crying out for. There isn't a Member in this body who isn't hearing about that back home.  We want to solve that problem. A resolution like this is certainly not going to get in the way of that, but what we need to do is make sure we fund the authorizations that, on a bipartisanship basis, we passed in 2015.  Unfortunately, if you look at the budget that came over from the White House back in May, the White House proposed a 13.5 percent cut to the Department of Education, elimination of all Federal funding for K-12 teacher professional development, and afterschool programs, which I was up at one of them, the 21st Century Learning After School Program in Norwich, Connecticut, a distressed municipality. They had kids, after school, working on their computer skills, their math skills, their science skills to give them the chance to keep up with their grade level and to be school ready when they go into high school.                              {time}  1700  Again, the big one was the cut to title 1, which, as I said, is the workhorse making sure that low-income kids actually have funding levels that at least come somewhat close to their counterparts in more wealthy parts of the country in wealthy school districts. So, again, this resolution is not certainly going to be a negative, but it certainly misses the opportunity that we really should be focused on as Members of Congress for bolstering the public side of the public-private partnership.  As I said, the private sector is speaking loud and clear that they are looking for these skills and actually stepping forward like companies like General Dynamics at the shipyard that I described in southeastern Connecticut or The Hartford and Travelers up in the capital city of the State of  What we need to be doing is match them in terms of our commitment to make sure we are funding magnet school programs, again, title 1 programs, that help the 90 percent of kids who are in public schools so that we actually are going to achieve the goal which this resolution sets forward.  So, again, I certainly commend the sentiment of the sponsors of this, but it leaves out, really, what I think is the real question of the day, which is whether or not we are going to step up as a nation and truly fund public-private partnerships to boost computer science skills.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-18-pt1-PgH10152.txt,1836,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,18.0,December

97,topic-id,468,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, as I said earlier, this resolution is a sentiment that is hard to dispute or argue, but, unfortunately, it is just that, a resolution that really, beyond sort of expressing a goal, an aspirational goal, doesn't move the ball forward in terms of actually implementing what I think this resolution seeks to do, which is to make sure that school districts--every school district--particularly those with low-income kids from urban areas and rural parts of the country, have the resources which the Every Student Succeeds Act signed into law 2 years ago and laid a pathway out for us to achieve, but, unfortunately, because of the funding levels that have not come close to the authorized levels, we are falling short.  I couldn't agree more with the speakers, the proponents of this, that what is at stake here, really, I think, pervades almost every priority and every sector of our country's economy and our national policy.  In 1958, when the Russians fired Sputnik, then-President Dwight Eisenhower stepped forward and advocated the National Defense Education Act because he recognized that, from a national security standpoint, having a national policy to make sure that there are adequate resources out there for our Nation was really central to our national defense. That triggered, again, a revolution in American education, whether at the higher education level or even at the elementary level; and following that lead in 1965, we passed the ESEA Act, which funded, for the first time, title 1 that gave resources to low-income districts.  That commitment has deteriorated. It has deteriorated over the last 6 years with budgets that have underfunded this program. If you really took title 1 in terms of the full measure of eligibility for low-income students and school districts, we are funding it at about half of what the real need is out there for those types of school districts.  So, again, hopefully maybe this resolution will be an awakening for people in this Chamber, particularly as we are on the verge of taking up the 2018 budget, that funding education is as important to our economy and is as important to our national defense, frankly, as any other part of the Federal budget, because that gives us the tools to succeed as a nation, not just in 2018, but in many years forward.  So, again, I certainly am friends with some of the sponsors of this resolution. I salute the sentiment that was offered when this was introduced just a week or so ago, but, frankly, it falls short of the true commitment that we need to make as a Congress to fund and give the resources to make sure that this aspirational goal is achieved.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-18-pt1-PgH10152.txt,1836,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,18.0,December
138,topic-id,599,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I join my colleague from Kansas (Mr.Estes) today and rise in support of H.3759, the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage Family Caregivers I want to congratulate all the cosponsors of this bill for their good work in terms of bringing this forward, and, again, it looks very promising that it will be passed and signed into law shortly.  Mr.Speaker, the number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to reach 70 million by 2030, roughly doubling the number that existed in 2005. As those Americans age and require assistance with their daily routines--taking medication, getting dressed, cooking, and attending medical appointments--family caregivers will step in to make sure that their loved ones are safe and cared for.  This is difficult work. For an adult child, caring for an aging parent can quickly become a full-time job. Between juggling appointments, understanding medications, helping make informed medical decisions, a caregiver's own priorities can take a backseat. Most caregivers have jobs of their own, and many care simultaneously for an aging parent as well as their own children.  But caregivers are not only providing care for older Americans or even younger Americans with developmental disabilities. They also serve those who have served our country.  I recently met with a caregiver from my district, Jessica, who cares for her husband, a veteran who suffered serious traumatic brain injury during the battle of Her experience managing her husband's complex medical needs while also raising their children goes to show that ensuring caregivers are supported is a national priority.  The bill under consideration today would recognize the contribution that family caregivers make toward the safety and health of older It would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and maintain a strategy to support family caregivers by establishing an advisory body to bring together caregivers, older adults, persons with disabilities, veterans, employers, and State and local officials. This advisory council would make recommendations for how to support, assist, and engage family caregivers.  Caregivers are needed to help Americans live independently in their homes and communities for as long as possible. In my home State of Connecticut, there are 459,000 family caregivers who provide an estimated $5.9 billion in unpaid care, annually. Supporting older and disabled Americans through caregiving and ensuring caregivers are equipped to take on this important role benefits all Evidence has shown that, when caregivers are supported, patients delay placement in a nursing home, continuing with lower-cost, long-term support in the home for much longer periods of time.  Caregiving is foundational to our long-term care system in the United This legislation is an important step to ensure this work is recognized and supported.  Again, as the gentleman pointed out, the Commission on Long-Term Care, which was actually created by this body in 2012 as part of one of the budget bills that passed that year, was a group of stakeholders from all across the country, in various sectors, that came together and issued a report that, unfortunately, I don't think has gotten the focus and attention it needs with the demographics that our country is experiencing right now: the aging of our society.  However, this is one of those recommendations for which signs of intelligent life appeared in Congress, and we are taking up their call for passing legislation like the RAISE  So again, I want to congratulate all the sponsors for coming together, and I am looking forward to sending this bill to the President for his signature.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-18-pt1-PgH10148-11.txt,1836,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,18.0,December

712,topic-id,1574,"Mr.President, this week is a great week for the State of Texas and for the Federal judiciary because this week we will be confirming two exemplary judges from the State of Texas to the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit: Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett and former Texas Solicitor General Jim These will be the 11th and 12th court of appeals nominees who we will have confirmed this year--a modern-day record.  Indeed, I looked up just the other day the number of assigned slots on the Federal courts of appeals. It is 179. This means the 12 that have been nominated and confirmed this year represent roughly 7 percent of the appellate bench. That is a powerful accomplishment for the first year of this Presidency, a powerful accomplishment for this Republican majority in the Senate, and a powerful legacy that will extend decades into the future, protecting our constitutional rights, protecting the Bill of Rights, protecting the First Amendment, free speech, religious liberty, protecting the Second Amendment, and protecting all the fundamental liberties we enjoy as  With respect to Don Willett and Jim Ho, I have known both of them for decades. Both are close friends. Both are brilliant lawyers. Both have spent decades earning a reputation as principled constitutionalists who will remain faithful to the law and will not impose their own policy preferences from the bench.  Beyond that, both Don and Jim are testaments to the American dream. They have both taken different paths to the Fifth Circuit, but both of their stories encapsulate what is so incredible about this great  Justice Willett was born Donny Ray Willett--his birth certificate doesn't say Donald; it says Donny Ray--in July of 1966, to an unwed teenage mother. He was a sickly and frail newborn who was not even expected to survive until But he was nursed back to health and then adopted by an incredible couple who were unable to have their own children.  Justice Willett grew up in a double-wide trailer in a small town of just 32 people, surrounded by cotton and cattle. His town had a cotton gin and a Catholic church. That is about it.  Justice Willett suffered heartbreak early in life. His father passed away at age 40, just 2 weeks after Justice Willett turned 6 years old. He was[[Page S7992]]raised by his widowed mother, who waited tables at the local truck stop. She would leave the trailer for her 6 a.m. shift before Justice Willett even woke up in the morning. He would wake himself up, get fed, dressed, and then catch the bus to a neighboring town to go to school.  Justice Willett was the first person in his family to even finish high school, let alone go to college and then to law school. He has four degrees. He got his bachelor's from Baylor with a triple major in economics, finance, and public administration. He then received a master's degree in political science, a law degree, and an LLM degree from  After law school, he clerked on the Fifth Circuit--the court on which he will soon be serving--for Judge Jerre Then, after 2\1/2\ years at a large law firm, he decided to dedicate his career to public service. He worked for George Bush in Texas and then for President Bush in He and I worked closely together in that regard. After his time in DC, he happily returned to the great State of Texas to serve as the deputy attorney general for legal counsel. Don served alongside me, working under Greg Abbott, then the attorney general. We had offices just down the hall from each other.  In 2005, he was appointed by Rick Perry to serve as an associate justice on the Texas Supreme Court, and he was reelected by the people of Texas to that court in 2006 and again in 2012.  I can't tell you how proud I am to see Justice Willett confirmed as a judge on the Fifth Circuit and to see his lifetime of service continue in this new arena.  Jim Ho took a different path to the Fifth Circuit, but his story is just as powerful as an example of the American dream.  Jim was born in Taipei, He immigrated to the United States with his family when he was just 1 year old. For the first few years of his life, his family lived with relatives in Queens, Jim learned English watching Sesame His family then moved to Southern California, where he attended high school and then went on to college at Stanford  In 1996, Jim enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School, where he graduated with high honors in 1999. He then moved to Texas for the first time in his life, accepting a clerkship in Houston with Judge Jerry Smith on the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit--again, the same court on which he is preparing to serve. It was during the end of his clerkship in Houston that he started dating his law school classmate, now his wife Allyson, a Houston native and another dear friend of mine.  In 2000, Jim moved to Washington, DC, to join the law firm of Gibson Dunn & In 2001, he joined the U.Department of Justice as a Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, working under now-U.Labor Secretary Alex Later that year, he joined the Department's Office of Legal After 2 years at OLC, he came here to the Senate, where he served as the first chief counsel of my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, John After 2 years as Senator Cornyn's chief counsel, Jim went to clerk at the Supreme Court for Justice Clarence  At the end of the clerkship, Jim and Allyson finally fulfilled their dream of going back to Texas, where Jim rejoined the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in  Then, in 2008, my tenure as solicitor general of Texas was coming to a close. Attorney General Abbott had told me that if I were going to leave, I would have to find my successor. I picked up the phone and called my longtime friend, Jim I talked to Jim about coming to succeed me as solicitor general. Jim agreed to take on the job and did a remarkable job as the chief appellate lawyer for the State of Texas, representing Texas before the U.Supreme Court and all the State and Federal appellate courts.  Jim served as solicitor general from April 2008 until December 2010, when he returned to Dallas and once again rejoined Gibson Dunn as a partner. A few years later, he became cochair of the firm's appellate and constitutional law practice group. Jim has done many extraordinary things, but nothing more so than marrying his wife Allyson, who is, like Jim, a Supreme Court advocate and one of the most talented constitutional lawyers in the country.  Allyson is my former law partner. When I left the job of solicitor general and went to the Morgan Lewis law firm, I promptly recruited Allyson to come lead the Supreme Court practice with me. I am proud to say that over the past 5 years, Jim's wife Allyson has argued more business cases before the U.Supreme Court than any lawyer in  Jim has become a pillar of the legal community in Texas, and the outpouring of support he has received demonstrates that. To take just one example, I have a letter from Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas and a former member of President Obama's Cabinet and, incidentally, the Democratic nominee for the U.Senate who Senator Cornyn defeated in 2002. By any measure, he is a strong and prominent Democrat in the State of Mr.Kirk writes:       The last time Texans got to fill a seat on the Fifth      Circuit, it was Judge Gregg Costa, who this body confirmed by      a well-deserved unanimous vote. As a lifelong Democrat and      devoted member of the Obama cabinet, I ask you to give Jim Ho      the same unanimous consent.  I agree, and I hope our Democratic friends in this body will set aside the partisan rancor that has so characterized this year and will listen to the words of one of their own, a member of Obama's Cabinet, and a prominent Democrat from Texas, urging that Jim Ho be confirmed unanimously.  Sadly, Senate Democrats insisted on and provided a party-line vote in the Judiciary It is my hope that this full body will demonstrate more wisdom and less partisan animosity than the Judiciary Committee Democrats demonstrated.  Both Jim and Don, I am convinced, will make excellent judges on the Fifth They are brilliant. They are principled. They are humble men of deep character. They love their families. They are wonderful fathers. I am confident that not only will they faithfully follow the law in the court of appeals, but I predict Jim Ho and Don Willett will become judicial superstars. They will become jurists to which other Federal judges across the country look. Their opinions will be cited heavily. They will be followed in other courts of appeals. Their careful and meticulous analysis and their fidelity to the law will be held up as exemplars for judges across the country to follow.

Almost exactly 1 year ago, President Obama, over the objections of many[[Page H9794]]stakeholders, utilized the Antiquities Act to unilaterally designate 1.35 million acres of land as the Bears Ears National Last week, President Trump came to Utah to help resolve this issue by reauthorizing this monument into two much smaller national monuments, the Indian Creek and the Shash Jaa National  Although both executive actions have ignited widespread anger and resentment on each side of this issue, I still believe that both sides share many common goals and values and can work together for the benefit of We can all agree that these important lands must be responsibly managed for future generations to appreciate.  Now that Utah has two, more manageable monuments, the time has come for Congress to act to ensure that these archeological treasures and sacred Tribal lands are protected the right way. I believe the right way to manage these lands is to have input from Utah's Tribal members, local citizens, and government officials.  Additionally, there needs to be a management plan that protects important archeological sites and sacred Tribal land while also maintaining multiple uses of these lands, such as recreation, hunting, and grazing.  Lastly, the legislative process and constitutionally mandated system of checks and balances are the best way to both determine the best management of these lands as well as the creation of any new national parks, monuments, recreation, and conservation areas.

When I enlisted in the Army, I was privileged to serve in Germany, wear our country's uniform, and see the fruit of generations of work. I also saw the concern that Germans had that Ronald Reagan was going to cause World War III and that actual leadership was somehow a problem.  Instead what we saw was that Mr.Gorbachev didn't tear down the wall. The United States of America didn't tear down the wall. The East German people tore down their own wall.  And why did they do that?  They did that because they knew the truth of what was on the other side.  Mr.Poliquin's bill is a major effort to try to help the people of Iran get their country back. They are under a strong authoritarian leadership system that has oppressed their people and caused harm throughout the region and, in fact, throughout the planet.  Meanwhile, I am so thankful that this is a bipartisan bill.

61,topic-id,619,"Mr.Speaker, first of all, I echo the comments I have heard from other colleagues to thank my colleague from Illinois, Representative Kelly, for her unwavering commitment to this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to speak for those who have died in the United States as a result of senseless gun violence. I want to reflect this evening on where we have been, where we are now, and where we must go from here.  When I took office 1 year ago, I was so excited to give my first speech on the House floor. But I never dreamed my first speech would be a tribute to a former friend and colleague.  My first floor speech was to honor Sergeant Debra Clayton, a law enforcement officer who was shot and killed while trying to apprehend a murder suspect, a person who should have never had a gun in his possession in the first place.  Since then, two more law enforcement officers from central Florida, Officer Matthew Scott Baxter and Sergeant Richard Samuel Howard, have been shot and killed, both officers of the Kissimmee Police  I was sworn into Congress just 6 months after the mass shooting in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub where 49 people who were involved in what my bishop likes to call a late-night fellowship--not doing anything wrong, not in the wrong place--were killed by a lone gunman.  At that time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern American history. But in the short time since then, the number 49 has been surpassed as 59 people were killed in Las Vegas just a few months ago.                              {time}  1915  What this says is things are not getting better, and Congress has failed to take responsible action. Since the Newtown shooting, Congress has held at least 50 moments of silence for the victims of gun violence. But, Mr.Speaker, please tell me: How does a moment of silence protect the next victim?  I join my colleagues in honoring the victims who have died tragically of gun violence in our The victims deserve to be remembered. Their families deserve recognition, and the victims and their families deserve action.  John 13:17 says: ``Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.'' Well, we now know these things. In other words, when you know better, Mr.Speaker, you are supposed to do better.  We also know that the vast majority of the American people across the Nation want action.  As a former law enforcement officer, I had a duty to enforce the laws to protect the innocent; and, Mr.Speaker, as Members of Congress, we have a duty to enact laws that protect the innocent. We need to stand up to the gun lobby and take on their indiscriminate sales of bump stocks and other modifications that make weapons deadlier or more suited for criminal violence. We need to strengthen programs that work, such as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and drastically improve mental health screening and treatment.  And I continue to oppose concealed carry reciprocity, as I did last week on the floor, because it would allow persons from outside your State to bring their firearms anywhere in your State, making the job of law enforcement officers on the street who have the responsibility of sorting it all out more difficult and, potentially, more dangerous.  Mr.Speaker, the men, women, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters gunned down in our country deserve remembrance. They also deserve courage from their leaders. They deserve action from their leaders. I once again call on this body to provide some.  Debra Clayton, Matthew Baxter, and Sam  Again, I thank my colleague from Illinois for her unwavering commitment and leadership on this issue.

669,topic-id,398,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Representative Gianforte and Representative Connolly for their work on this bipartisan bill to extend the authority for agencies to conduct telework pilot programs for travel expenses. The current authority for this program expired on December 9 of this year, so passage of this bill is urgently needed. The bill extends the program until December 13 of 2020.  In February of 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office used this authority to initiate the Telework Enhancement Act Pilot This program allows USPTO employees to work throughout the country and waives the requirement that the agency pay their travel costs for mandatory trips back to its headquarters.  According to the USPTO, the program significantly expanded the agency's teleworking workforce and allowed it to hire and retain a highly skilled workforce. The USPTO also estimates that this program has saved the agency more than $77 million in fiscal year 2016, including $17 million in avoided real estate costs and nearly $32 million in reduced recruitment expenses.  The agency also cites increased productivity, work hours, employee morale, and decreased environmental impacts as benefits of the pilot. Given its benefits, it makes sense to authorize an extension of this pilot program.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that the Oversight Committee received from The National Treasury Employees Union yesterday supporting the bill.

Dear Representative: As National President of the National      Treasury Employees Union, representing over 150,000 federal      employees in 31 different agencies, I am writing to express      NTEU's views on HR 4171, a bill to amend title 5, United      States Code, to extend the authority to conduct telework      travel expenses test programs, which is scheduled to be      considered by the House tomorrow.       NTEU represents the trademark attorneys at the U.Patent      and Trademark Office (PTO). The enhanced telework program has      allowed employees to work and live in various communities      across the nation, saving PTO office property costs and      reducing employee turnover. We support the bipartisan      legislation for a short-term extension of the pilot, which we      believe has been a success for both the PTO and employees. We      believe, with the expiration of this new extension, that the      agency will have the experience to be able to allow national      telework while covering employee travel costs.

924,topic-id,736,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for all the work he does on behalf of Dreamers throughout the country. His leadership in this effort is absolutely inspiring.  I am here to speak out in favor of passing a clean Dream Act to create a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants who enrich our country and strengthen our economy and national security. The passage of the Dream Act is critical to the thousands of Dreamers living in  I want to share one young woman's story. This is Christian Christian traveled from Mexico with her mother and younger sister because her mother was fleeing an abusive marriage. At only 6 years old, Christian was brought to the United States not knowing a word of She needed to adapt quickly to her new home.  Christian worked hard in school to learn English and made great efforts to excel in all of her academic subjects. Then, when she was in the third grade, she was diagnosed with a learning disability, which might have caused her to become frustrated and to see a decline in her grades. However, in her own words, she said:       I didn't let that get in the way and I did not let bad      influences in my neighborhood get to me. There, in the back      of my head, there was always a little voice saying,      ``Education is the way to a better life.''  Christian pushed through and finished middle school and high school as an honor student and, despite her constant hard work and proven academic record, she faced an unexpected obstacle--adults in her life who doubted her ability to attain a college education. As she tells it, many adults in her life simply assumed that an undocumented student like Christian could not obtain a college education. While these doubts broke her heart, she was not deterred.  Christian's hard work, grit, and academic merit all earned her admission to Northern Illinois University where she received a private scholarship. She also worked multiple retail jobs selling flowers, shoes, and clothing to fund her education. Although her future was uncertain, Christian never let up on her academics or her many work responsibilities to put herself through school.  Finally, in the last few years of her college education, she received some relief with the implementation of the DACA In 2015, she became the first person in her family to graduate with a bachelor's degree.  She had a job offer right after graduation which, as anyone can tell you, is not an easy feat. Although her DACA work permit expired that summer, when she had intended to start working full-time, her company was so invested in having her come on board that they worked with Christian to ensure that her DACA work permit was renewed. Their investment was worthwhile. Within the first 2 years at her company, Christian reached 1 in sales nationwide. She is now a branch manager of her company and consistently one of the top performers in sales.  Christian also opened doors for other DACA recipients who have joined her at her company and are also excelling in their roles. She is just one of thousands of Dreamers who positively contribute to our  It is evident that our businesses and communities benefit and thrive from the work ethic and the perseverance Dreamers like Christian possess. There are no truer American values than to work hard, accomplish your goals, and to have the ability to fully contribute to society.  Unfortunately, due to the Trump administration's elimination of DACA, nearly 800,000 of our young people like Christian are now vulnerable to deportation. Thousands of young people who participated in the DACA Program and who are legally in the United States may no longer be able to serve as doctors, teachers, students, and, yes, even servicemembers in our military. This decision will also tear families and communities apart.  I implore my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the contributions of our DACA recipients throughout the country. I urge my colleagues to not shortchange the thousands of Dreamers who learn and work alongside our families and friends. We must do everything we can to make sure the Dream Act is addressed before the holidays.  I will not turn my back on Dreamers like Christian, and I will fight to protect DACA recipients as we work to make the Dream Act the law of the land.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

889,topic-id,880,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time.  Before I get to my bill, if I could just address a few points that have been brought up in this debate, which I am surprised at the fact that the Rules Committee doesn't actually talk about the rule. We talk about a whole bunch of different issues, but maybe I am new to this game.  I have to say that the gentleman from Georgia is correct. Infrastructure investment in the internet has gone down over the last 2 years.  I would agree: If it is not broken, why did President Obama try to fix it?  It was working really well for 20 years, and we had great innovation.  In regard to the tax bill, that is being debated. I think we are looking at some unique arguments that are being made. The Democrats are over there and they are fighting for the poor middle class American, and all Republicans are fighting for the rich. It is a great line. I love the line. But let's look to the wealthiest communities in                              {time}  1430  Go look right outside of D.Look in Northern Are those wealthy communities, those counties in Virginia, are they Republican or Democrat? They are L.A., San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, New York are all really rich communities that elect  The wealthiest and biggest corporations, think of the tech industry in California or the biggest in What are they? They are And that is why. When the tax debate comes up, you see Democrats fighting for loopholes and preferences for their big, wealthy friends.  And that is why, when Republicans here in this House said maybe to write off the mortgage interest on a $1 million home, that might be a little too much, maybe we should lower it to $500,000 of mortgage interest deductions, my Democratic friends freaked out.  Oh, no, the poor, middle class people in my community who have a $1 million mortgage, they are just having a tough time getting by--that was the argument that was made, fighting for the loopholes and preferences for the wealthiest Americans, while we are fighting for the middle class.  You talk about investment in my bill? You want to talk about pension funds? What has happened to pension funds in America? What has happened to American 401(k)'s? They have gone through the roof because we are lowering rules and regulations in a smart way, and we are going to reform our Tax Code to let families and businesses keep more of their income because they can spend it better than anyone in this town. They do it well.  So if you want to tank the markets, do what you have been doing and tank tax reform.  I want to get to my bill. This is on proxy advisory firms. I have taken awhile to get here, but the role of proxy advisory firms in the U.economy and shaping corporate governance is profound. These firms, they counsel pension funds and mutual funds and institutional investors on how to vote the shares of the corporations that they own.  You think, well, that is pretty benign. That is not a big issue.  Well, the shares of institutional investors' ownership in 1987 was 46 percent. Today, institutional investors own 75 percent of American corporations, billions of shares institutional investors control and look to proxy advisers for advice.[[Page H9865]]  There are just two firms that control 97 percent of the market. So two companies, basically, are having a huge influence on American corporate governance, and they are involved in the writing and analysis and reports and voting recommendations that affect fundamental corporate transactions like mergers and acquisitions, approval of corporate directors and shareholder proposals--a huge impact on corporate governance.  And they are not immune from conflicts of interest. For example, in addition to providing recommendations to institutional investors about how to vote, proxy advisory firms may also advise companies about corporate governance issues, rate companies on corporate governance, help companies approve those ratings, and advise proponents about how to frame proposals to get the most votes.  I am going to come back to that in a second, but there was a Stanford University study that said institutional investors with assets under management of $100 billion or more, they only make 10 percent of the voting decisions, which means they offload 90 percent to proxy advisory firms.  So I don't know if you are familiar with the Mafia, but you have got the old storekeeper on the block, and he is robbed one night--right?--gets beaten up and robbed, and the next day, the thugs come in and go: Hey, hey, I hear you were robbed last night. You pay a little fee, we'll take care of you and make sure you are not robbed anymore.  That is exactly what proxy advisory firms are doing. They are like: Oh, you got a bad recommendation. Let me tell you what. You buy our services, and we can help you in the future. Just pay the ransom, and we will help take care of you in future recommendations.  This is not the way corporate governance should work. So my bill brings transparency and accountability to proxy advisory firms.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

891,topic-id,312,"I thought that is what Democrats want: making them more responsive; bringing more competition into the industry; making it better for investors; specifically, again, a bipartisan bill. Republicans and Democrats voted for this legislation.  But we will ensure that proxy advisory firms are registered with the Oh, how bad is that, registering with the SEC, a little oversight?  We are going to disclose potential conflicts of interest. How radical is that idea?  Shouldn't we tell people that we have a conflict of interest, and shouldn't all parties be aware of it?  I don't know why my friends across the aisle, or the gentleman from Colorado would be opposed to that.  Maintain a code of ethics. That is not shocking. I think most people would agree to that point.  And make publicly available the methodologies for formulating proxy recommendations and analysis.  Again, this is transparency. This is a commonsense bill that both Republicans and Democrats have voted for because we have recognized--and again, I am not a big regulation guy, as the gentleman from Colorado had pointed out. But when you consolidate a great deal of power in two companies that have a huge impact on American corporate governance, that makes a lot of people uncomfortable; and to have a little more oversight, to have a little more transparency, to have a little more accountability is a really, really good thing.  Some of the smallest companies have been the biggest complainers about how these proxy advisory firms have held them hostage. So let's support the small innovators, the big job creators in America that are complaining about the big proxy advisory firms. Let's stand with them and the families that they employ, and the future families, if they are successful, that they will employ, and let's give a little more control to proxy adviser firms.  I ask all to support this great bill.  ",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgH9860.txt,99999999999999,STRENGTHENING OVERSIGHT OF IRAN'S ACCESS TO FINANCE ACT,2017.0,13.0,December

Mr.Speaker, H.4323, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, is about helping expand veterans' job and education opportunities in the sciences.  The bill requires the National Science Foundation to develop a veterans outreach plan and to publish data on veterans' participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields in its annual Indicators report.  The bill also updates the Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, its fellowship programs, and cyber grant programs to include outreach to veterans.  Additionally, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is tasked with overseeing an interagency working group to examine how to increase veteran participation in STEM career fields, including addressing any barriers for servicemembers and their spouses.  In the next 5 years, between 1 and 1.5 million members of the United States Armed Forces will be leaving the military, according to the Department of Many of these veterans will be seeking new careers. By a great margin, veterans cite finding employment as their number one need when returning home.  According to the U.Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations in the STEM fields are projected to grow to more than 9 million between 2012 and 2022, an increase of 1 million jobs.  Research shows that many military veterans already have skills and training that align with STEM careers, particularly in information technology. However, research has also shown that veterans face many barriers as they reenter the workforce, including a lack of formal STEM education, career guidance, and the difficult task of transferring military credits to civilian credits.  Our Nation's veterans deserve every opportunity to transition to a healthy[[Page H10164]]and successful civilian life.

Reaching farther and broadening our understanding of the universe is one of the most important and honorable challenges that we can face together. I believe that working together with our allies and partners on the peaceful exploration of space is an essential part of what makes NASA a vital national asset. This bill strengthens NASA's ability to do this important work.  I am also pleased that the bill includes a recognition that sensitive and proprietary information should be protected.                              {time}  1800  Mr.Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues to join me in support of the United States and Israel Space Cooperation  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

481,topic-id,1416,"Mr.President, this week, Senate Republicans sought to confirm the 10th, 11th, and 12th circuit court nominees of the year. The Republican-controlled Senate has been moving at warp speed to try to confirm President Trump's circuit court nominees as quickly as possible. Twelve circuit court nominees is the same number of nominees confirmed in the first years of Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton combined.  In quickly rushing through President Trump's picks for these critical lifetime appointments, my Republican colleagues have been abandoning longstanding norms of due diligence and careful scrutiny. They want to rubberstamp these nominees despite a lack of complete information about the nominees' records and despite clear warning signs about the nominees' ideologies, temperaments and judgment.  Consider the nominees that came before us this week.  Eighth Circuit nominee Steven Grasz received a rare unanimous ``not qualified'' rating from the American Bar Only 4 out of 1,755 nominees reviewed by the ABA since 1989 have received this rating. For those who are not aware, the ABA has worked since the Eisenhower administration to conduct a confidential peer review process for vetting judicial candidates. For their review of Mr.Grasz, the ABA conducted 207 interviews with his peers. These interviews revealed some very troubling things. People familiar with Mr.Grasz raised serious concerns about his objectivity, his gratuitously rude conduct, and his deeply held partisan loyalty. Those are major red flags for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.  After the ABA's review committee voted Mr.Grasz unanimously ``not qualified'' for the bench, rather than reconsidering their support for the nominee, a number of my Republican colleagues decided to aggressively attack the One Senator described the ABA as ``blatant partisans with a sad track record of hackery.''  These criticisms are over the top. The ABA peer review and vetting process provides the Senate with valuable information to consider when we decide how to vote on nominees. President Obama took ABA ratings seriously enough that he did not nominate anyone who received a ``not qualified'' rating.  Of course, Senators do not have to vote on nominees solely based upon ABA ratings. For example, I voted in committee for Kansas District Court nominee Holly Teeter despite the ``not qualified'' rating that she was given by the I have voted against nominees who received ``well qualified'' ratings, such as Neil Gorsuch, because I had serious questions about their judgment and their objectivity.  It would be foolish for Senators to ignore the ABA's peer review process altogether. In Mr.Grasz's case, his ABA rating is just one of many troubling signs. Just look at some of the controversial things Mr.Grasz has said and written. He wrote in a law review article that courts can ignore jurisprudence that they consider to be ``questionable.'' He wrote that the legacy of Roe v. Wade was ``moral bankruptcy.'' He described the possibility of Nebraska recognizing same-sex marriages as a ``grave danger.'' He falsely claimed that the term ``sexual orientation'' could include bigamy and pedophilia. He tried to amend the Omaha city charter because he was upset about a 2012 city ordinance protecting LGBT employees from workplace discrimination.  In Mr.Grasz's case, I share the ABA's unanimous view that he lacks the proper temperament and judgment to sit on the circuit court, and I am deeply concerned about his extreme views. That is why I opposed his nomination.  I also could not support the nomination of James Ho for the Fifth Circuit, for several reasons. First, I am very troubled by Mr.Ho's responses when I asked him whether waterboarding is torture and illegal under U.law. He said, ``It has always been my understanding that Congress enacted legislation for the purpose of expressing its serious opposition to waterboarding as illegal under U.law.'' That is not an answer about what the law says; that is an evasion. Mr.Ho should have said, with no equivocation and no uncertainty, that waterboarding is illegal, that it is cruel, inhuman, and degrading and that it is torture. That is the law under the 2006 McCain Torture  This is a critical issue for me. I am deeply troubled that we are, once again, seeing nominees come before the Senate, like Mr.Ho and Greg Katsas, who are tap dancing around this issue. We need to take a clear stand when it comes to waterboarding.[[Page S8043]]  This is not some abstract hypothetical for Mr.He wrote a 2002 Office of Legal Counsel memo for John Yoo that was cited in the infamous Bybee torture memo. It is critical that the Senate get access to Mr.Ho's memo. The Bybee torture memo was a dark chapter in our Nation's history, and Mr.Ho's work was cited in it more than once. I cannot in good conscience vote for Mr.Ho's nomination without seeing what he wrote.  In 2014, when former OLC attorney David Barron was nominated by President Obama to the First Circuit, Chairman Grassley insisted on seeing his OLC memos. Chairman Grassley wrote of Mr.Barron: ``The Senate simply cannot evaluate whether this nominee is fit for lifetime appointment to one of the nation's most important courts without complete access to his writings.'' The chairman's standard should apply to Mr.Ho's nomination as well.  I also have serious concerns with personal views that Mr.Ho has publicly expressed--in particular, his writings in opposition to campaign finance laws and the op-ed Mr.Ho wrote in praise of Jeff Mateer, who has described transgender children as part of ``Satan's plan.'' I could not support Mr.Ho's nomination.  I also was compelled to oppose the nomination of Don Willett to the Fifth Justice Willett provided us with one of the more troubling nomination hearings we have had in recent years. The key moment was when Senator Feinstein asked him if he stood by beliefs he expressed in a 1998 memo. In this memo, Willett explained his opposition to the issuance of a gubernatorial proclamation declaring ``Business Women's Week'' in  Willett's memo said:       I resist the proclamation's talk of `glass ceilings,' pay      equity (an allegation that some studies debunk), the need to      place kids in the care of rented strangers, sexual      discrimination/harassment, and the need generally for better      `working conditions' for women (read: more government.) . . .      I strongly resist anything that shows we believe the hype.  When Senator Feinstein asked Justice Willett if he still held these beliefs, he was silent for 10 and a half painful seconds before he asked Senator Feinstein to repeat the question. She did, and I repeated the question too; yet Justice Willett never gave the committee a straight answer. He should have, if he wanted to earn my vote.  Justice Willett is a prolific tweeter, and he has sent tweets that appear to mock same-sex marriage and transgender students. This raises questions about his judicial temperament. Justice Willett also has expressed troubling views about what he calls ``judicial passivism.'' He said it is ``corrosive'' when judges ``are not active in preserving the limits our Framers actually enshrined.'' Justice Willett seems to think that courts should be activist in limiting laws that he sees as burdening economic freedoms, such as regulations that protect the health and safety of working people.  In short, Justice Willett has not convinced me that he is in the mainstream when it comes to temperament and judgment, and I could not support his nomination.  Before I was a Senator, I was a lawyer in downstate Illinois, and I looked up to Federal judges. I thought that, to get that job, you had to be a cut above. Otherwise, you wouldn't make it through the Senate's rigorous advice and consent process, but sadly, this Republican Senate is turning advice and consent into a rubberstamp assembly line when it comes to Trump nominees.  Republicans want to pack the courts with judges who will support President Trump's agenda, and so they are hurrying to confirm as many of his picks as possible, even if they are not qualified or if we don't have all the information we need to evaluate them or if the nominees won't give us straight answers at their hearings. Our Federal judiciary is being diminished as a result.  I wish my Republican colleagues would stand up for an independent judiciary and a meaningful advice and consent process. We should not be rushing to hand lifetime appointments to problematic nominees. Instead, we should take our due diligence and vetting obligations seriously and only put people on the bench whose qualifications, integrity, independence, and judgment are indisputable.  Because that was not the case with this week's nominees, I could not support them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgS8042-4.txt,326,BORINQUENEERS POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,14.0,December

867,topic-id,1394,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, and I certainly thank my colleague from Nevada for giving me an opportunity to speak for a few minutes. I also thank my friend from Oregon for being steadfast on this subject.  It has been 16 years since we passed the DREAM We have been through a lot. We made it here on the floor of the We passed it on the floor of the There was an effort at comprehensive immigration reform which included the DREAM It was a glorious day when it passed with a strong bipartisan vote and then a bitter disappointment in the months that followed when it languished on the floor of the House of Representatives and never was called for a hearing or a vote on the floor. So many of these thousands of young people who would be protected under the DREAM Act didn't know what the future would hold.  President Obama stepped in and created DACA through Executive order, and with DACA protection, some 800,000 young people were given a chance to be part of America--something they always dreamed of. They went to college, got jobs, and they did important things in their lives that they had put off and frankly reached the conclusion that they would never be able to do.  One of the things that many of them did, which surprised people, was to pursue their goal of being part of the U.military. We have an All-Volunteer military. These young people, undocumented in America, who have no legal status in our Nation, were prepared literally to give their lives for our country, the only country they have ever known. Is there any question in your mind as to their devotion to this Nation? Not in mine.  When you hear their stories, you will understand why. I have a story I want to tell you tonight. It is a story about Alan  Alan Torres was brought here as a child from He grew up in North Dallas, TX, where he was a great student and athlete. In high school, he was placed in a program for advanced math and science. He took advanced placement courses in a variety of subjects which I dutifully avoided in high school, subjects such as physics, chemistry, anatomy, and physiology. He was captain of the high school varsity cross country team, where he won the district championship. He was the company commander in his high school's Junior Not only was Alan an academic overachiever, he was also an artist on top of everything. His work was displayed and sold at regional level competitions, and he earned many awards.  His most vivid memory of high school, however, was none of these things but of 9/11, the day of the terrorist attack on the United He was sitting in school, wearing his JROTC uniform in Texas, and he cried with his classmates when they heard what happened to He said he thought to himself, ``I can't believe this happened to my nation.'' My You see, as a kid, Alan always believed this was his It wasn't until he was unable to do things many of his friends could do that he realized he was undocumented in America, with no legal status. He couldn't get a driver's license like his buddies did. He couldn't apply for financial aid to go to college.  Alan still pursued his dream despite these obstacles. By the time he graduated from high school, he was working three jobs to save up enough money to go to school. He attended a local community college because he didn't have any money. He needed low tuition. He received an associate's degree from Dallas Community Then he transferred to the University of Texas, There, he got a bachelor's degree in information systems management. After all his hard work, he graduated from college debt-free. That is how hard he worked. He paid for his education out of his pocket because he couldn't count on any Federal loans or financial aid.  Today, Alan Torres--this young, undocumented man, protected by DACA--is a software engineer for He developed software that helps medical providers across the country to better manage the health of over 50 million patients.[[Page S7967]]  He wrote me a letter saying:       [DACA] is what I would pray for all those nights when I      would stay up late doing homework or lay awake full of      anxiety for the future. It has allowed me to fulfill my      potential and reach my goals without the fear of not knowing      if I am going to wake up in a strange country tomorrow. . . .      Dreamers are not perfect, but we work hard, love this      country, and would love the opportunity to show it.  Alan is one of 31 Dreamers working for People like Alan are the reason that IBM and a lot of business leaders are calling us and saying: Are you crazy, Senator? You would deport Alan Torres? He earned his education in the country the hard way. He succeeded where others failed. He has the ambition and drive that we all pray for in our children and those we admire, and you want to tell this man to leave the United States of America?  These business leaders are pretty hard-nosed about this. For their part, they have an excellent employee, and they don't want to lose him.  More than 400 business leaders wrote a letter to Congress urging us to pass the bipartisan Dream Act or DACA or whatever you want to call it. The letter says:       Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our      economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of      why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.  That is the business viewpoint on this whole issue of the Dream  In a few weeks, we want to go home for We want to celebrate with our families. We understand that it is a special time of year for so many in America, this Christmas and Hanukkah season. We know we give thanks at Thanksgiving, but we give it again on Christmas Day as we count our blessings. One of the blessings we count on is the blessing of opportunity.  We know that in this great Nation, people have an opportunity to make a better life for themselves, their kids, for their future, and for our Think about Alan Torres over this Christmas, and think about 800,000 just like him, uncertain about what the new year will bring, uncertain because we have failed to act in  It was the President and Attorney General on September 5 who challenged us to do something. The President said: I am going to do away with Obama's Executive order, and now, Congress, do something. But all I hear from many of my colleagues is, well, let's see tomorrow if we can work this into the schedule or maybe next month or maybe the month after. We can't do that. There has to be a sense of urgency on our part too.  These young people--many of them have tearful speculation about their own future. I just talked to one of my colleagues from Colorado who came back from a meeting with half-a-dozen Dreamers, and as they told their story, they all broke down in tears. Do you know why? They are just about to give up hope--not on our country but on us--on the Senate, on the House, on politics, on I think we are better than that.  This Nation of immigrants has many people with many great stories. The Presiding Officer told a great story about his family and what it meant personally growing up. I have heard it and I am inspired by it, as I am and he is by many other stories we hear. This is what America is all about.  This issue really tests who we are and what we believe in and what our values will be. There are 100 ways to get to the finish line, but we need to do it by December 22. That is when we are supposed to break for Let's make sure that as we break for Christmas, we give these young people, these Dreamers, these DACA people we have protected, a bright future for a happy new year, literally.

Pass a law if you want to protect 780,000 young people who had signed up under  DACA was the direct result of the DREAM Act, which I introduced 16 years ago, to try to protect young people who came to the United States, brought here by their parents at an early age, who grew up here and don't have a future. They don't have a home. They don't have a legal status. They don't have a country to call their own.  It strikes me that these young people themselves did nothing wrong. I can even argue that their parents did what every parent would do--the best thing they could for their kids. But in this situation, trying to focus on what their future will be, their future is clearly in doubt, and right now many of them are worried about what is going to happen next.  You see, without the protection of DACA, they can be deported. They are undocumented. They can't legally work in the United States, and many of them have wondered whether they should continue school or what they will do when they can't go to work. These are real-life challenges, and many times they break down emotionally as they talk about the uncertainty of their future.  Just outside this Capitol is a beautiful Mall, and smack dab in the middle of it are two white tents. They are tents that have been built by these young Dreamers in an effort to process hundreds of people, just like themselves, who are coming to Washington to tell their stories to Senators and Congressmen in the hopes that we will do something.  There are some in the Senate who don't want to help them at all. They[[Page S8011]]don't believe they should receive any help in any way whatsoever. There are others who say: Let's put it off. Let's do it sometime, maybe next year. Next year is coming soon, and under the President's decision, on March 5 of 2018--just a few weeks from now--there will be no DACA protection whatsoever.  It means that today, 122 a day of these DACA-protected young people will fall out of protected status. March 5 of next year, the number goes to 1,000 a day--1,000 a day--who will be subject to deportation, uncertain about what their future might be.  I think it is time for us to do something, and I hope that we can do it on a bipartisan basis and do it in a timely fashion. It is important that we fix our entire immigration system, but let's not try to do everything that needs to be done on immigration when we should be taking care of these young people as our highest and first priority.  I am ready to sign up for immigration reform. I was there before. It was called the Gang of 8--four Democrats and four A few years ago, we came up with a comprehensive bill to pass the The Republicans in the House refused to even call for a hearing, let alone a vote on the floor.  We should do our part to pass the new DACA, the new Dream Do it before we leave this year. Do it this year so that we can spare these young people the anxiety and stress and fear they have because of the current situation and so that we can meet President Trump's challenge.  I didn't like the fact that he eliminated DACA, but it is fair for him to say to us: You have 6 months, Now do something.  I am not in control here. I am in the minority, being a It is up to Republican leaders here.  All I hear from Republican leaders is: Let's wait until next year and see if we have time to get around to this. We have the time, all the time we need now, to do this.  I want to thank a number of people. First, I want to thank the 34 Republican House Members who, last week, sent a letter to the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, saying that we should fix the DACA system before we leave this year. Thank you to those 34  In this Chamber, I want to thank 6 or 10 Republican Senators who have either cosponsored the Dream Act or are now actively engaged in helping to rewrite its replacement in the I am sure this kind of bipartisanship is a surprise to those who follow Congress, but it is an indication that many people share my belief that it is a simple matter of justice to give these young people their chance to become part of America's future.  I started a few years ago, when the Dreamers worked up the courage to declare publicly that they were undocumented--frightening their parents but giving them some unity and identity in I started coming to the floor when they sent me their color photos and telling their stories because there is no speech I could give that matches the stories of their lives. Each time I tell a story, I know it makes a difference. I know the people who are watching this on C-SPAN and those who are in the Galleries here in the Senate pay close attention because we are talking about real lives and real people.  Tonight I want to tell you about Carla Carla Martinez was brought to the United States from Mexico at the age of 8. She grew up in the Austin and Pflugerville area of Texas, and she was an excellent student. In middle school and high school, she enrolled in advanced placement and community college courses, and she was recognized as an AP scholar student. In high school, she participated in the band, and she worked and volunteered in her community. During her senior year, Carla would go to school from 9 a.m. until 2:30 in the afternoon, then she would work from 3 in the afternoon until 11 at night and only then start her homework.  In August 2012, Carla began her studies at the University of Texas, San Antonio, obtaining a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. A student like Carla, who is undocumented, did not qualify for Federal Government assistance. It meant there was no Pell grant to help her pay for college or a Federal loan to help her pay for college. She had to work to earn the money to pay her way through school. Something which many people would shrink away from, she accepted the reality of being undocumented in Because she was ineligible for financial aid, she worked to support herself, and she often had to choose between food and buying books.  During college, Carla was also an officer in a number of organizations, including the Society of Women She was a College of Engineering Ambassador, which means she had to maintain a very high GPA at the University of During her summers, Carla interned at Alpha Testing and the San Antonio Water System while she also worked as an engineering camp counselor.  In August of 2016, Carla was the first DACA recipient to study abroad with the University of Texas at San Antonio's Education Abroad She studied in as part of the first group of students to participate in the Urbino, Italy, civil engineering program.  Because she couldn't get financial aid, studying abroad was more difficult for her than the other students who were part of the program. Not only did she need the money to go to college, she needed to raise the money to pay for the study abroad. She never gave up.  One of her professors said:       Carla is a very dedicated student. She has excellent      organizational skills and works well with her classmates. She      is a team player. Her involvement with the College is      fantastic--she has been an ambassador.  In May 2017, Carla graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio with a civil engineering degree and two job offers. Today she works full-time at M&S Engineering as a water/wastewater engineer.  Her dreams for the future are to go back to school and get a master's in business and engineering and to give back by creating a scholarship program to help fund other engineering students.  Carla wrote me a letter about her worries because of President Trump's decision to take away her protection from being deported from the United Here is what she said: ``Every day that passes, it's a day closer to not being able to work, not having a driver's license, and not being able to financially provide for my family as the head of the household.''  People like Carla are the reason more than 400 business leaders signed a letter to all Members of Congress urging us to do something and pass a bipartisan Dream The letter says:       Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our      economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of      why we continue to have a global competitive advantage.  That gathering of Dreamers out on the Mall, just away from the Capitol dome here, are a lot of young people just like They are coming here in the hopes that Members of Congress will slow down in the hallways on the way to their office or to a committee hearing and just hear for a moment their stories--stories just like Carla's--stories that really beg us to do something. We know we have to, we know we should, and there is absolutely no reason to delay it.  Why would we want this amazing young woman, who has done so many extraordinary things in her life, to live with this uncertainty 1 minute more than she has to? Why wouldn't we step up and do what we are supposed to do?  I am working on this with colleagues. A number of Republican Senators have been sitting down in my office, even today, trying to work out the details on a compromise. We are not quite there, but there was a determination in our meeting today to get there, to put something together.  I would like to do this before we leave for the holidays. I think it is only right that we try our very best to achieve that, and I think we can. I think if Members of both sides show good faith, we can reach that goal.  I want to especially thank Lindsey Graham, my cosponsor of the Dream Act, and Jeff Flake of Arizona, another cosponsor, who have stepped up and really just shown extraordinary commitment to this cause. We also have Lisa Murkowski and Cory Gardner as well who are cosponsors of the same legislation, and there are other Senators who are working with us behind the scenes to get this done. Some[[Page S8012]]of them I know are taking a political risk to do it, but they believe it is the right thing to do, and they want to be on the record to be part of the solution. I am looking forward to working with them.  In a few weeks--maybe only 10 days now--Congress is going to adjourn to go home for the holidays, but Dreamers can't go home for the holidays because they really don't have a home. They are homeless in America because they are waiting on us to come up with the legislation that defines their status and gives them a future. Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers can't enjoy the holidays the way many of us can because of their concern about being deported from the United States of America, separated from parents, brothers and sisters, friends, family, and loved ones.  When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said: ``The moment of reckoning is coming.'' Well, that moment is here. Congress has the responsibility to do our job to make the Dream Act the law of the land before the end of this year or bear the responsibility for forcing hundreds of thousands of talented young immigrants out of the workforce and putting them at risk of immediate deportation.  The question we face is very basic, Will the United States of America be a better nation if Carla is forced to leave? This woman's determination, her drive, and her talent have brought her to this glorious moment when she finally graduated college. With this degree and with this education, she can offer us so much more and really serve America and its future.  This is the country she loves. She deserves the respect of this country, and she deserves the determination of the Members of the Senate to take this up as a highest priority in the closing days of this Senate session.

Today we have an opportunity to shine a little brighter.  As we continue our battle to defeat terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran remains dangerously corrupt. While the average Iranian earns a mere $15,000 a year, corrupt, top political and military leaders control an estimated one-third of the nation's total economy. These same leaders are, more often than not, the same ones who repeatedly provide support for acts of terrorism in the Middle East and continue to sponsor terrorist groups around the world.  Unfortunately, the Iranian Government continues to tolerate this corruption, which is why the State Department has named Iran as a country of primary concern for money laundering and it continues to be listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.  These officials who perpetuate such destructive and destabilizing behavior should and need to be exposed.  Today, I encourage my colleagues to support H.1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency This bill will require a list of the known assets of senior Iranian officials to be made publicly available in all three of Iran's major languages.

It is enshrined in our founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in charters of democracies all over the world.  The freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all is a broad right that should not be restrained by a government or a fanatical group. Religious persecution holds societies back, undercuts progress, and is usually associated with a much broader assault on basic human rights.  Here in the United States, we must make it clear that it is not enough to just guarantee religious liberty to our own people. We must speak out and act when we see this freedom, this liberty, and any other freedom under attack anywhere and hold accountable those responsible for human rights abuses.  In places like China, we see freedom of speech under attack. In Chechnya, we see LGBT individuals targeted, tortured, and executed by Putin's cronies just for whom they love. We see women's reproductive rights under attack.  We must also speak out against attacks on our press, on our right to organize, on equality for LGBT persons, and on women's right to control their own bodies.

I am pleased to be the lead sponsor on this resolution.  After more than a decade of good progress in the U.S.-Mexico partnership, this year we have seen some things change course in a troubling way. It is a problem, and it needs to be stopped. That is why I offer this measure reaffirming our strong commitment to our relationship with We don't want anyone there to have any kinds of questions. We believe in a strong U.S.-Mexico relationship.  Mr.Speaker, I also thank our ranking member on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Mr.Sires, and Mr.Castro for their efforts on this resolution and their support day in and day out for a robust U.S.-Mexico partnership.  Mr.Speaker, it is hard to overstate how important the U.S.-Mexico relationship is and the tremendous impact it has on Americans every single day. Mexico is a friend and ally. Mexico is our third largest trading partner. It is a country with which we share deep person-to-person, family, and cultural ties, and it is a country where we have painstakingly cultivated a vibrant, critical relationship between our two countries.  Over the past century, there have been many highs and lows in the U.S.-Mexico relationship. Unfortunately, sometimes, recently, we have had a lot of lows with talk about building walls and other derogatory talk about We don't want that to continue. We want to establish and reaffirm the strong U.S.-Mexico relationship.  In 2007, I became chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs That was the same day that the Merida Initiative was announced by Presidents Bush and Calderon, which led to a new level of security cooperation between the United States and  That effort wasn't perfect then and it isn't today. The civilian toll of Mexico's drug war is still far too high, and human rights violations at the federal, state, and local level in Mexico remain a serious problem. But what we gained from the Merida Initiative was an entirely new way of collaborating with the Mexican Government on a wide range of security issues.  Presidents Obama and Pena Nieto built on Merida's foundation, and one of the results was a remarkable achievement in the last hours of the Obama administration, which was the extradition of drug kingpin ``El Chapo'' Guzman to my hometown of New York City to stand trial. Without a strong U.S.-Mexico partnership, that would not have been possible. A decade ago, it probably would not have happened at all.  And while we absolutely don't need to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a 2,000-mile-long wall against our southern border, what we do need is to maintain our partnership on security matters with the Mexican  We want the Mexican Government to continue to reach out to us with information regarding suspected terrorists. We want to say that the Mexican Government will cooperate with us and extradite the next drug kingpin to the United States, and it goes on and on. So we cannot overemphasize just how important the U.S.-Mexico partnership is and how it keeps Americans safe on a day-to-day basis.  336 underscores the importance of a U.S.-Mexico relationship built on mutual respect. Mutual respect means building bridges, not walls, between our two countries; it means recognizing the vast contributions of Mexican Americans to our country and not classifying an entire population as drug dealers and rapists; it means not singling out an esteemed judge based solely on his race.  Congress has an important opportunity today to be the adult in the room and let the Mexican Government and the Mexican people know that our relationship with them is very, very important and will continue to be important.

The Supreme Court hears between 100 and 150 cases each year out of the more than 7,000 it is asked to review. But in 2015 alone, more than 55,000 cases were filed in Federal appeals courts.[[Page S8024]]  These cases range from crime and terrorism to bankruptcy and civil matters, and the judges who hear these cases will affect millions of  So it is extremely important who is confirmed to these lifetime positions. Federal judges have a tremendous impact on individuals, businesses, and the law. In a way, circuit courts serve as the de facto Supreme Court to the vast majority of individuals who bring cases. They are the last word.  These nominations are very important. That is why it is so concerning that Republicans for years refused to allow judgeships to be filled.  The simple fact is the rush to fill judicial vacancies is the direct result of Senate Republicans' historic obstruction of judicial nominees during President Obama's administration.  During President Obama's last 2 years in office, just 22 judicial nominees were confirmed. That is the fewest in a Congress since Harry Truman was In contrast, during the last 2 years of the George Bush administration, Senate Democrats confirmed 68 judicial nominees.  At the end of last year, three circuit court nominees and 20 district court nominees had been approved by the Judiciary Committee and were waiting for votes on the Senate floor. Republicans refused to schedule votes for those nominees, many of whom Republicans themselves voted for, so they could hold those seats open. Four more circuit court nominees and 52 district court nominees were pending in committee and never even received a hearing.  Now, 1 year later, the Senate is voting this week to confirm the 10th, 11th, and 12th circuit court nominees this year. Republicans went from delaying all nominees to cramming them through at a breakneck pace.  The 11 circuit court nominees who have already been confirmed are more than any President in the first year of office since Richard  Two nominees we are considering this week, James Ho and Don Willett, lay out the Republican playbook.  These seats on the Fifth Circuit have been vacant since 2012 and 2013, even though the Obama White House tried to work with my colleagues from Texas to fill these seats with consensus nominees.  But once President Trump entered the White House, they wasted no time in rushing to put conservative judges in those seats.  Don Willett was nominated on October 3, James Ho on October 16.  Just a month later, on November 15, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing for both circuit court nominees on the same day, and cloture was filed immediately on both nominations after the committee advanced them.  The speed at which these judges are being rammed through the process is stunning.  In fact, on four occasions in the last 6 months our committee has held hearings for two circuit court nominees at the same time. This happened only three times in all 8 years of the Obama administration.  This is a problem because it gives Senators less time to review each nominee's record and less time to ask each nominee questions. Candidly, it makes it very difficult for us to exercise our constitutional duty to ``advise and consent.''  We are already seeing the ramifications. Just yesterday, the White House announced that two of its nominees would not be moving forward. One nominee, Brett Talley, had already been voted out of the Judiciary Committee, but we learned of troubling undisclosed information while he was pending on the floor. This may not have happened if we had sufficient time and cooperation to fully review these nominees.  In the month of November, the Judiciary Committee had hearings for five circuit court nominees. I have served on this committee since 1993, and we have never held hearings for five circuit court nominees in a single month before. That is during a month when we spent a week at home for  Republicans refused to advance seven circuit court nominees last year, but now we are speeding through the process to fill those seats with conservative judges. Fairness aside, we should all be concerned that we are giving lifetime appointments to potentially unqualified nominees.  Now, I would like to talk about the three nominees we're considering this week. This week, Steven Grasz was confirmed to the Eighth  The American Bar Association has rated 1,755 judicial nominees since 1989, and only two of those have been unanimously rated ``not qualified'' based on concerns over their impartiality.  One was a nominee for the Fifth Circuit in 2006 who was never confirmed. The other is Steven  Let me repeat that. This week, for the first time since at least 1989, the Senate voted to confirm a nominee who was unanimously rated as ``not qualified'' by the American Bar  The ABA doesn't rate nominees based on what the evaluators think. Rather, they review a nominee's written record, talk to the nominee, and interview many people who have direct personal and professional knowledge about the nominee.  Here are just two direct quotes from the ABA's review:  ``Mr.Grasz's professional peers expressed concerns about his views of stare decisis, and questioned his commitment to it.''  ``[A] number of Mr.Grasz's professional colleagues expressed the view that, in terms of judicial temperament . . . Mr.Grasz is not `free from bias.' Specifically, they expressed the view that he would be unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge.''  These are stunning indictments of a man who was confirmed to a lifetime seat on a circuit court.  Some of my Republican colleagues argue that the ABA is biased. The numbers just don't bear that out.  Over the last 30 years, during both Republican and Democratic Administrations, the ABA has rated nearly 1,800 nominees and rated only two ``not qualified'' based on their temperament.  I voted against Mr.Grasz's nomination and am very concerned that he was confirmed on He did not have the support of a single Democratic  Next I would like to talk about James Ho, nominated to the Fifth  During his time at the Office of Legal Counsel, Mr.Ho wrote a legal analysis of the scope of the term ``cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment,'' which is prohibited under Common Article 3 of the Geneva  Unfortunately, this memo remains classified, and we haven't seen it.  The reason we know this memo exists is because Jay Bybee cited it in one of the so-called torture memos, which were used to justify torture and have since been widely discredited.  The Bybee memo also appears to have relied on Mr.Ho's analysis to argue that because the term ``cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment'' ``appears to . . . have a rather limitless reach,'' conduct that qualifies as torture should be defined more narrowly than what is prohibited under international law.  It is this kind of flawed legal reasoning that allowed the U.Government to torture people, and I have argued that no vote should have taken place on Mr.Ho's nomination until we had access to that memo.  The Justice Department has provided us access to similar memos written by nominees for judgeships, so there is no reason to deny us access to the memo James Ho authored.  I can't possibly vote in favor of a nominee to a lifetime appointment who may have helped provide the legal basis for torture, and it is a shame we are voting on this nominee this week.  Finally, I would like to speak about Don Willett's nomination to the Fifth  At his hearing, my first question was about his 1998 comments on a draft proclamation for then-Governor George Bush to honor the Texas Federation of Business and Professional Women in 1998.  Let me quote from them: ``I resist the proclamation's talk of `glass ceilings,' pay equity (an allegation that some studies debunk), the need to place kids in the care of rented strangers, sexual discrimination/ harassment, and the need generally for better ``working conditions'' for women (read: more government).''  I asked Justice Willett if these were still his beliefs, and he refused to answer. I asked again, and again, he refused to answer. Senator Durbin asked[[Page S8025]]the same question, and Justice Willett refused to disavow these beliefs.  As the National Women's Law Center wrote, ``Mr.Willett's skepticism of the existence of sex discrimination should disqualify him from the bench. Litigants coming before Mr.Willett . . . would have reason to question whether their claims of discrimination, including sexual harassment and pay discrimination, would be fairly and impartially heard or, instead, treated as `hype' to `debunk.'

Shortly after receiving his bachelor's degree, Chris enlisted in the U.This surprised his family and friends. His father attributes Chris's decision to his son's sense of duty and interest in aeronautics. Chris graduated from basic combat training at Fort Jackson before attending his advanced individual training in aviation mechanics. The idea of Chris working in aviation mechanics always struck his father Bob as somewhat funny. Growing up, Chris didn't like getting his hands dirty or helping to change the oil in the family vehicles.  Due to his strong academic record and interest in aeronautics, Chris was persuaded to apply to Warrant Officer Candidate Chris liked the idea of becoming a warrant officer so he could specialize and become an expert in aviation. He graduated at the top of his class from Warrant Officer Candidate School and became a helicopter pilot.  While performing his duties in the Army, Chris also took classes at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical He graduated with a master's degree in aeronautical science in 2001--the same year the September 11 terrorist attacks shook the lives of all  Chief Warrant Officer Allgaier deployed to South Korea for over a year before going to Afghanistan in 2003 and Iraq in 2005. While deployments are usually tough for any family, 2005 was especially difficult for the Allgaiers because Chris's mother Sally passed away.  In 2006, Chris was assigned to the 3rd General Support Aviation Battalion, 82nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, The unit deployed to Afghanistan in 2007. He flew CH-47 Chinook helicopters in transport missions. During this time, Chris flew a lot of night operations. His father said that Chris would call him every couple of weeks between missions just to catch up. Those were phone calls that Bob always looked forward to receiving.  The Upper Sangin Valley in Helmand Province was the center of fighting in Afghanistan in 2007. A British newspaper called it ``the deadliest area in Afghanistan.''[[Page S7996]]  On the night of May 30, 2007, Chris flew another night operation transporting approximately 30 servicemembers from the 82nd Airborne Division in the Upper Sangin Shortly after dropping the soldiers off for their important mission, insurgents shot down his CH-47 The crash killed Chris and four other servicemembers.  Chief Warrant Officer Allgaier's memorial service was held on June 6 at a Catholic church in Hundreds of people, including over 100 Patriot Riders, turned out to pay their final respects.  Chris was laid to rest on June 18, 2007, in Arlington National Fellow CWO Paul Wetzel said that ``losing Chris will definitely leave a void in the aviation community that can't be filled by anybody else. There will be other pilots in the future, but none will ever equal Chris Allgaier.''  Chris is survived by his wife Jennie and three daughters--Natalie, Gina, and  In 2010, Chris was honored by the unveiling of Christopher Allgaier Street in the neighborhood in which he grew up. Rob discussed how his brother was his hero during the ceremony. He said:       [Chris] didn't see himself that way. He didn't see himself      as a martyr or as a hero. He was an American who was doing      his duty. They're not doing it for an ulterior motive.      They're doing it because they believe in it and it is the      right thing to do.

Steve Grasz from Nebraska is a nominee who has earned the respect of his peers. He believes in the rule of law. He has the education and the training. He has the experience needed to prepare him for this serious responsibility. Steve has a keen intellect and the humility that allows him to show respect toward all. He has an even and calm temperament--a judicial temperament.  Steve Grasz served as the chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska for 12 years. In that role, Mr.Grasz professionally and capably defended the laws of the State of Nebraska, authoring nine briefs in the U.Supreme He has earned the respect of the Nebraska legal community. Timothy Engler, president of the Nebraska State Bar Association, has stated he always found Steve ``to be professional, civil, and ethical in all respects.'' In short, Steve is an outstanding Nebraskan and a talented legal mind.  The scores of recommendation letters we have received for Steve are a testament to his temperament, his integrity, and his character. These recommendations come from a diverse group of Nebraskans, from political officials to church pastors, business and community leaders, and Steve's friends and neighbors.  Steve has bipartisan support from those who know him best. Nebraskans from across the political spectrum have pointed to Steve's thoughtfulness, fairmindedness, high ethical standards, and brilliant abilities as a jurist. This includes former Democratic Governor and U.Senator Ben Nelson, who wrote that Steve ``was an asset to our state and Nebraskans benefited from having such a capable and thoughtful professional in public service. Today, he is unquestionably one of the foremost appellate lawyers in the state, making him an obvious choice for this seat on our federal appeals court.''  Debra Gilg, the former U.attorney for Nebraska and a Democrat appointed by President Obama, said:       Steve has always enjoyed a reputation for honesty,      impeccable integrity, and dedication to the rule of law. He      possesses an even temperament well-suited for the bench and      always acts with respect to all that interact with him.

1064,topic-id,991,"Madam President, I rise today because I believe that some here in Washington are under the illusion about what would happen if we were to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or  Some people still, inexplicably, believe that this would be a good thing. They believe the relationship between the United States and Mexico and Canada is somehow a raw deal for Let's talk about Mexico for a while.  In reality, Mexico spends 26 percent of its GDP in its purchasing of goods from the United States, while we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP--I think it is 0.2 percent--in our purchasing of goods from them. Again, for those who obsess over trade deficits with Mexico, Mexico spends 26 percent of its GDP in its purchasing of goods from the United States while we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP in our purchasing of goods from them. Prior to NAFTA, our total trade with Mexico was under $80 billion. Now that trade approaches $600 billion. That is a good thing. That is good for us, and it is good for Trade is not a zero-sum game.  These folks also seem to think that terminating NAFTA will have no lasting impact on this Nation or its economy. In reality, pulling out of NAFTA would have sweeping negative consequences for Americans all over the country. Let me briefly describe what America would look like without  It would be an America with fewer jobs and higher unemployment. Some of these jobs that would be lost would not return for decades, maybe even for a generation. Other jobs would never return. It would be a poorer America without The gross domestic product would drop. Much of the positive growth that we have seen recently may be erased. In the last year, we have seen impressive GDP numbers. We have achieved great growth through strong, conservative policies--in our having a better regulatory environment, in particular. I hope the days of 1-percent growth are behind us, but if we scrap NAFTA, that may not be the case. An America without NAFTA would be one crippled by subsidies.[[Page S8029]]  I agree with my colleague from Kansas and the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee chairman, Senator He recently explained that the withdrawal from NAFTA would add to farmers' demands for increased farm subsidies at a time when Congress simply cannot afford that. These farmers would prefer to sell their crops at reasonable prices, but in our exiting NAFTA, they will certainly ask for economic protection through increased farm subsidies. I believe that many of these subsidies are automatically added and that these subsidies would substantially grow the national debt and dramatically curtail any ability to rein in government spending.  Without NAFTA, we will likely find ourselves in a less secure The withdrawal from NAFTA will destabilize the Mexican economy and create a crisis on our southern border. Terminating this agreement will seriously undercut the important progress that has been made over the past several decades--that of improving drug enforcement and stabilizing the Mexican economy. Efforts toward privatization, criminal justice reform, and modernization have been good for the Mexican economy. In turn, it has been good for our economy as well.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, the number of people trying to cross illegally into the United States from Mexico has fallen to the lowest level in 46 years. That is largely due to there being a better economy in If we pull out of NAFTA and allow Mexico to plunge into economic chaos and uncertainty, it will, certainly, drive up the number of those who want to come to the United  These are the real ramifications of terminating NAFTA--an America with higher unemployment, a lower GDP, more Federal subsidies, particularly for agriculture, and increased illegal immigration.  All of this--exiting NAFTA--would come before we would face the ultimate challenge of negotiating a new trade agreement to replace Anyone who suggests that this process is quick or easy is sadly mistaken. In today's global economy, people and nations have more choices than ever.  For evidence of this, look no further than to the disastrous decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Canada and Mexico, like other TPP nations, could decide to move ahead without the United These countries have more choices than ever. It used to be that we were the only game in town. That is not the case anymore. These countries have and will move on without us. They could simply refocus their efforts on alternative markets and explore new trade partners. It is a dangerous game when we in America are no longer seen as a reliable trade partner. We will have countries that will be reluctant to enter into agreements with us and that will simply not want to renegotiate.  Let's not be swayed by those who would have us believe that the impact of exiting this trade agreement would somehow be minor or short-lived. There are some who say that we have to exit the agreement in order to negotiate a better agreement. As I have explained, just exiting the agreement will have real ramifications--canceled contracts, particularly for those in agriculture when you are dealing with commodities. Let's not be misled by those who are under the illusion that negotiating an entirely new trade agreement, as I have said, will be simple or painless. It will not be.  In closing, we have seen the limits to the philosophy of ethno-nationalism and economic nationalism. We have seen those limits politically, gratefully, this week in Let's not follow those who believe in that philosophy or who are advocating an ethnocentric, or an extreme, nationalistic trade policy.

He, too, has been a leader introducing the first net neutrality bill back in 2006, before I came to the  I rise to talk about tomorrow's vote at the FCC on a proposal that would throw out the strong net neutrality rules Americans have fought so hard for. They are rules that ensure that all content on the internet receives equal treatment from broadband providers regardless of who owns it or how deep their pockets are.  Plain and simple, these rules are about ensuring that the internet remains the platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression, as it has always been.  As I reflect on my time in the Senate, there are, of course, moments that stand out as particularly significant. One such moment came in February 2015, when American consumers and businesses celebrated the FCC's landmark vote to preserve a free and open internet by reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers under title II of the Communications  While I had long urged the FCC to ground net neutrality rules in the agency's authority under title II, it wasn't just the outcome of this vote that made such an impression on me then, or now, as I am looking back.  The FCC's 2015 vote came after the agency received nearly 4 million public comments, making it the then most commented on FCC issue by a factor of three. The vast majority of these comments urged the agency to enact strong rules protecting net neutrality, protecting the equal treatment of all content on the internet, which has been the architecture of the internet since the very beginning. Americans from across the political spectrum organized to ensure that their voices were heard, and they were. This was democracy in action.  Now, as Chairman Pai pushes forward to undo the open internet order, we have seen another awe-inspiring demonstration of grassroots advocacy. Millions of Americans from every corner of the Nation and background imaginable are joining the movement online and in the streets to ask the chairman to rethink his dangerous proposal and to preserve net neutrality.  When things get tough, as they have, time and time again in the last year, Americans have resisted in protest. It is these movements that make the difference. Just look at the Republicans' failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Ironically, the kind of civic participation that has aspired so many of us in recent months and has affected real change depends, in no small part, on an open internet. If the Chairman ultimately has his way, we will be entering a world where every voice might not matter, a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to bury sites offering alternative viewpoints or control how users get their information, a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in a slow lane.  See, it is because of net neutrality that people from across the Nation can connect with each other, share their ideas on the internet, and organize a community effort just like the Project Net Neutrality protests we have seen at Verizon stores across the country.  I have spent nearly the entirety of my time in the Senate pushing for strong net neutrality rules. I have always called it the ``free speech issue of our time'' because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. Unrestricted public debate is vital to the functioning of our democracy. Now, perhaps more than ever, the need to preserve a free and open internet is abundantly clear, so we can't give up now.  Three years ago, the FCC sustained strong net neutrality rules, and millions of Americans voiced their support for them. The FCC must maintain and fully enforce the important court-tested rules that are already in place. Also, perhaps more importantly, the agency must respect the democratic process and the voices that made themselves so clear in 2014 and over the course of the last few months.

110,topic-id,1586,"Mr.Speaker, I take the floor tonight, along with many of my colleagues, to fight back against an attack on the rule of law and our democratic institutions.  Right now, the investigations into Donald Trump and the prior investigation into Hillary Clinton have been infected with the virus of severe bias.  Hillary Clinton went under investigation for the mishandling of classified information and her dealings through the Clinton Foundation, which was essentially investigated by her own fan club. Meanwhile, Robert Mueller obtained his team by fishing in the never-Trump aquarium.  Only through the antidote of transparency can we end this erosion of the rule of law and restore the American people's confidence in the institutions that we must trust to live in a civilized society.[[Page H9831]]  The people in this country have a right to know what has happened within the FBI, the Department of Justice, and within Robert Mueller's team as he probes the President and his transition. But there is so much in hearing after hearing that members of the Judiciary Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Oversight Committee have been told we don't have a right to know as the Representatives of the people.  Let's begin with the tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and former President Bill  We as the American people apparently don't have a right to know what was truly discussed. In information and reports that have been submitted to the Congress, there is extensive redacted information. So we don't get to see the substance of those communications between Loretta Lynch and former President Bill It is deeply troubling.  We also don't get to know what the informant would tell us who had information about Russia's attempts to impair the United States' uranium assets through the now infamous Uranium One deal.  We know that there was an informant. We now know that informant wanted to come forward and give information about bribery and kickbacks that undermine America's interests.  Unfortunately, people at the Justice Department who still remain in substantial positions of power went and sought a gag order so that the Congress wouldn't learn what was happening and so the American people wouldn't learn what was happening.  Then we learn that an inspector general who wanted to raise the flag of concern regarding the deeply troubling conduct of Hillary Clinton was essentially shut down.  Mr.McCullough has now given interviews upon his departure from the intelligence community indicating that he went to James He said that these mishaps, these potential violations of law, were serious and that they put America's national security in jeopardy. What he heard back from Mr.Clapper was that these revelations would create heartburn for the Clinton campaign.  It is ludicrous, when we have got potential bribes and kickbacks, and we have got the Clinton Foundation functioning essentially as a passthrough money laundering operation, that we wouldn't have all of the information that an inspector general would bring forward.  Mr.McCullough gave interviews where now he said that his family, his job, his agency, his mission was threatened by people in the deep state. That is not the America we need to live in. Transparency is the antidote to this type of corruption and this type of truly intolerable conduct.  Here is what we do know. We do know that the Democratic National Committee was off paying for a salacious and false dossier from the Fusion GPS company about the current President, Donald We don't know whether or not the FBI contributed funds toward that cause.  Think about that for a moment. When we asked the Attorney General and the FBI Director, were taxpayer funds used to go and obtain a dossier to discredit the President both before and after his election, we were told that we don't have a right to know and that the taxpayers don't have a right to know if their money was used in this way. It is troubling.  We also know that Nellie Ohr, the wife of a top Department of Justice official, Bruce Ohr, was actually getting paid by Fusion GPS, the company that ultimately produced this false dossier.  If that is not a conflict of interest, if that doesn't impair the credibility of this investigation, I don't know what does.  We also don't know who is in charge. We asked questions to the Attorney General regarding the nature of his recusal. Can the Attorney General appoint a second special counsel to evaluate the Clinton Foundation?  We got contradictory answers.  So as we prepare for the Deputy Attorney General Mr.Rosenstein's testimony before the Judiciary Committee tomorrow, we don't know if it is Mr.Rosenstein who can appoint a special counsel. We don't know if it is the Attorney General who has the power to do that.  We do know that the American people want it. Harvard University released a poll that said over 60 percent of the American people believe there should be a second special counsel to investigate Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, largely as a consequence of this intractable bias that we continue to see in the intelligence community.  So let's look at that bias as it is applied to Mr.Mueller and his team.  We have no idea how Bob Mueller picked the members of his team. I asked FBI Director Christopher Ray: Did people get on the Mueller team because they hate President Trump? Was there any vetting? Was there any review? Did we look at political contributions, political activity or activism from these folks?  The FBI Director would not answer my question.  So here we are, unclear as to whether or not the standard to investigate the President was a preexisting bias against him.  Mr.Speaker, I don't believe that it is a coincidence that the Mueller team is populated by people who bring that bias with them and who seemingly have acted upon it.  Mr.Weissmann, who is Mueller's number two, attended Hillary Clinton's election night party. Are you really telling me we couldn't find a number two in the Mueller investigation who wasn't at Hillary Clinton's election night party? For goodness sake.  We also know that Mr.Weissmann sent emails to Sally Yates, praising her for directly defying an order from the That should have disqualified Mr.Weissmann, but we don't know if that was, in fact, the qualifying factor that led him to be on this team.  Aaron Zebley is also a member of the Mueller team. He represented Justin Cooper, who set up the Hillary Clinton email server. Could we not have found people for the Mueller team who were not involved in setting up an email server for Hillary Clinton?  He also used a hammer to smash BlackBerrys, destroying evidence. Mr.Zebley may be a witness, yet he is on the Mueller team.  Jeannie She defended the Clinton Foundation against FOIA requests and now is involved in persecuting the In fact, over half of the members of the Mueller team have financially contributed to the campaigns of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, or both, and none of them contributed to Donald  I don't think it is a coincidence. I think it is ridiculous that the Congress doesn't have any information about how these people were selected, how they were vetted, how they were approved.  But it is not just the Mueller team. It is also the Department of Bruce Ohr, the head of counter intelligence, meets with Christopher Steele, who is the author of the dossier during the campaign. Then after the campaign, he meets with Glenn  All the while, Bruce Ohr, working at the Department of Justice, has a spouse getting paid by the very people developing these lies about the President to discredit him. It is smoking-gun evidence of bias and conflict of interest.  But it is not just the Mueller team and the Department of It is also the Andrew McCabe is the current Deputy Director of the When he was the assistant agent in charge of the Washington field office, he was sending out emails just weeks before the 2016 election saying that the Hillary Clinton investigation would be given special status, that it would be handled by a small team at headquarters.  What that means is that Hillary Clinton got different treatment than any other American who would have been charged with the mishandling of classified information in the Washington, D.C., area.  Absolutely outrageous. That special treatment didn't lead to a more rigorous review.

348,topic-id,1334,"Mr.Speaker, one of the tasks of having the second Special Order Hour is to find myself sitting here in this Chamber listening to the most absurd, ridiculous conversation that I think I have ever heard anywhere. My esteemed colleagues were here for the last hour in a different world, in a completely different universe, not of this world, but a different universe, And I am thinking: What in the world are they saying?  By my recollection, every one of our intelligence agencies said that Russia was involved in the campaign and developing information that was supporting the current I am thinking: I think that is what I heard over the last 9, 10, almost 14 months now. And yet my colleagues are up here and in a different world.  I will tell you what it is all about. This wasn't the subject matter that I was going to talk to tonight, but it was really about another scam, another scheme that is being perpetrated. This is all about, this last hour's discussion was all about somehow turning the table so that Special Counsel Mueller is demeaned, his work is somehow not authentic so that the investigation that is coming closer and closer to the Oval Office is discredited, setting the stage for what may very, very well be an extremely important task that this House has.  As that investigation continues, we will hear even more shrill discussions from the President's supporters tearing down that investigation, undermining the integrity of it, so that when that task comes to the House of Representatives in an impeachment resolution, they will simply say: Well, his entire investigation is discredited and, therefore, we are not going to proceed.  The American public isn't buying it, gentlemen. The American public is not blind. They are not deaf. They are listening, and they are understanding that an honest investigation is underway, based upon what our intelligence agencies discovered, based upon the fact--the fact--that the Russians did hack the DNC and did hack the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign and then weaponized those emails that were stolen. That is a fact, gentlemen, and you cannot wash away that fact.  And from there, we now have a special prosecutor, a special counsel in place who is carrying on an investigation, and indictments have come forward and penalties have been assessed and people have pleaded guilty.  All of that is the fact, and it is pointing closer and closer to the White House; and, therefore, I understand, gentlemen, I understand why you are so upset. I suppose if I were somehow to stand here and be an advocate for the President, I might be upset, too, because the net is drawing tighter, because information is coming clearer.  So come to the floor, do what you can, do what you can to undermine the investigation; do what you can, through your falsehoods, through your incorrect interpretations of plain facts, to undermine the integrity of an investigation. I understand why you would be intent upon doing so.  But the purpose of this evening isn't that. It is something that will affect America for the next two decades, at least. The purpose of this hour is to talk to the American people about what is happening here while these foolish floor discussions are going on.  What is happening here in Congress at this moment, this week, is one of the biggest transfers of wealth ever in America's history; the transfer of wealth from the working men and women of America, from the poor, from the elderly, to the superwealthy of  What is happening here in Congress now, in a conference committee, is the drafting of legislation, tax legislation, that will dramatically affect the American economy for decades.                              {time}  1815  Transferring wealth, benefits that the elderly receive in Medicare, transferring benefits that the poor receive in food stamps, in Meals on Wheels, in Medicare, Medicaid, children's health programs; transferring those necessary benefits that these men and women need to survive, to be able to live; transferring those benefits to the superwealthy in a tax proposal that gives to the largest American corporations and to the top 1 percent, over $5 trillion over the next decade, that is what is happening.  Here is a fact: American corporations that have already seen their share of burden to finance this government, to educate the Americans, to keep our military, to deal with national security, they have seen their share of the Federal revenues drop from some 20 percent--actually, 30 percent in 1939, 15 percent in 1960, down to somewhere in the 5 to 10 percent range. At the same time, the burden is shifted to the middle class. That is what is happening.  Here is what should be happening. Here is the way we ought to look at it. On The Mall here in Washington, we have the FDR Etched in the marble is this: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.''  I presented this upside down almost on purpose because that is precisely what our Republican colleagues are doing. They are taking that value and turning it upside down. Instead of doing more for those who have little, they are doing much for those who already control the greatest amount of wealth ever in the handful of a few people since the 1400s, when the Spanish Empire was ripping off the Western That is what is happening.  Of all of this money, the top 1 percent and America's biggest corporations are gaining, and the rest of Americans, over the next 5 to 7 years, are going to pay for that. We have to stop this tax cut. We have to stop it because it is terrible public policy.  American corporations don't need more money. It was reported today that Apple--the world's largest, most valuable corporation, Apple, in my State of California--is sitting on $2.5 trillion of cash today in the United States, and another $2.5 trillion of cash outside the United States, and they want their tax rate reduced. They are almost paying nothing now because they are able to escape American taxes.  They say: Lower the corporate tax rate so that there will be investment in  It ain't so. In the last 20 years, there has been a cataclysmic change in the way in which corporations use their profits.  In the 1970s, 50, 60 percent of the after-tax profits of corporations went into building their business, building new equipment, new manufacturing plants, adding employees, increasing wages. The remaining 40 percent or so went to dividends.  Where are we today?  Less than 10 percent goes to increasing a company's manufacturing, the company's employment, wages for workers.  Where does the rest of it go?  It goes to stock buybacks and to dividends. It goes to the shareholders.  And who are the shareholders?  The top 1 percent.  This is the scam of all times. They say we have got to reduce the taxes on corporations so that they will employ more If only they would. If only they would.  I am sure you have heard of AT&Do you know what the effective tax rate of AT&T is?  Not 35 percent, not 30 percent, not even 20 percent, as this tax bill would set as the maximum rate of corporations. The effective tax rate for the last 10 years for AT&T has been 8 percent. Eight percent.  And during that time, did they use that after-tax profit to add employees, to increase wages?  They laid off 80,000 American workers.  What did they use that money for?  Stock buybacks, corporate executives, $124 million to the CEO just 2 years ago.  I could go on and on, but I would like to bring to this debate Mr.Cicilline,[[Page H9837]]who has determined that there is a better deal, better wages, better future, better jobs.

Our Republican friends say they need to beef up the economy.  So tell me how it works.

Is that a better deal for America?  I don't think so.  The casualty loss deduction hurts. Three hundred homes in my district were lost in the October fires. The casualty loss deduction is gone. I don't know, maybe they will be able to rebuild. But when it comes time to address that deficit, I can assure you that they will do everything they can to cut the programs that would support that family as they attempt to rebuild.  So you get the program, you lose on the front end, your tax deduction is gone, and you lose on the back end when you go to get mortgage assistance.  There has got to be a better plan. There has got to be a better way to do it.  Mr.Speaker, over the years, in the last several months, Mr.Cicilline and his colleagues on the Democratic Caucus have put together a program for a better life for It involves much of what we talked about here. It involves a tax program that is balanced, one that provides the incentives for businesses to stay in the United We haven't talked about the corporate tax program that allows for territorial taxing, a specific effort in this legislation to encourage corporations to go offshore where their corporate income will never be taxed.  That is not a better plan. That is not a better program for building American jobs and wages. It is a way for corporations to continue to escape. Someday soon I would hope Mr.Cicilline and his colleagues would bring to this floor--the three of them who have put together this program on how we can build the American economy--well, the gentleman can talk in specific ways about how we can have educational programs, apprenticeship training programs, and job training programs, how we can encourage corporations to invest in America, and how we can Make It In America.[[Page H9840]]  I would love to join Mr.Cicilline and talk about a bill that we are soon going to introduce that would require that, when we export a strategic national asset--our oil and natural gas--that it would be on American-built ships with American sailors. We could employ hundreds of thousands of people in our shipyards by changing the laws and by providing incentives for Americans to stay here and to work here.  Mr.Speaker, I know this is Mr.Cicilline's effort. I know the gentleman wants to get to it. Perhaps we can wrap up.

373,topic-id,818,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Cicilline so very much for joining me tonight.  I really want to go back and plow this field one more time. I am just a farm boy from I don't know that we have said it enough nor have we said it all. We do know that in this tax scam there is a $1.4 trillion reduction in corporate taxes with no assurance that that is going to create jobs in But quite the opposite. It will be a great boon for the superwealthy, who will see their stock values go up as that additional after-tax income for the corporations is spent on stock buybacks, dividends, and executive pay.  We know that the alternative minimum tax will disappear, and that is about $900 billion to the, again, top income earners.  We know in California and across the Nation that the State and local tax deduction will be gone. That will probably cost those 32 percent of the taxpayers--the tax filers in my district that use that deduction--$1,000 to $2,000 in additional taxes.  We know this is going to go on and on, and we know that the deficit is going to be increased. There may be some growth. There has been one analysis that said there may be a couple hundred billion dollars of growth, but it is not going to make up for the $1.5 trillion deficit on top of the existing deficit.  We know the deficit hawks will be back. They have said it very clearly. They are going to come back and they are going to cut Medicare and We know they are going to take it out of the healthcare for the poor. They know they want to end insurance in the Affordable Care Act for 13 million All of that has been laid out. We know all of those things.  Oh, just in case you are one of those people who have high medical costs, like a senior 50 years of age, who has a serious medical condition and you have been able to deduct from your taxes the medical costs, forget it. Our Republican friends are eliminating the medical cost deduction.  Why would they do that? Why would they take after people who have serious medical problems?  Their out-of-pocket costs are covering all of that.  This is a long story, but for my colleagues here on the floor, Democratic and Republican, be very, very careful because this particular tax bill, should it ever become law, is going to take this Nation a decade, maybe two decades, to get out of from underneath the extraordinary burden that it is going to place on the American economy, on the working men and women, and on the poor in  The things we need to do, Mr.Cicilline talked about infrastructure. The President says: I am going to have a $1 trillion infrastructure program.  Really? Really? He is going to do that?  He just ripped the guts out of the American  Where is the money?  Oh, it is going to be private money. He has already given up on that. His words, not mine.  So where is the public investment?  Five trillion dollars disappears. Five trillion dollars. Some of it made up by the elimination of these deductions that I have talked about.  Still, there is at least a $1.5 trillion hole. The only way that they can possibly make up that after giving away all of that money to the corporations, all of that money to the superwealthy--and did I mention the estate tax?  I probably should have. The House bill eliminated the estate tax.  What does that mean to our esteemed President?  Well, he says that he is worth $10 billion.  Who am I to argue with him?  If he is, and he were to die, it means $4 billion less tax to his children. Four billion. Now, others say he is only worth $4 billion. So let's take $4 billion. For his children, it is simply a tax reduction of $1 billion.  What does that amount to?  That is what this is about. This is all about the wealthy. This is all about those who have much. It is most definitely not about what FDR said. Etched in stone on the FDR Memorial: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much. It is whether we provide enough for those who have little.''  So where is our heart? So what is our moral value? Is it morality? Is it right to add more to those who have much? Or is the purpose, the central value of this Nation the opposite, to add more to those who have too little?  That is where I am. That is where my Democratic colleagues are. I am afraid my Republican colleagues are proving the opposite.

637,topic-id,1489,"Mr.Speaker, 47 years ago, August 11, a baby boy was born to a mother and father in Detroit, Michigan, named Brian  Some 18 years after that, Brian made a commitment to serve his country by enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, where he served 3 years honorably, including a tour of duty in harm's way in  Discharged from the Marine Corps honorably in 1994, Brian Terry followed his calling to serve by becoming a police officer. He then made another commitment not to serve just his community, but our In 2007, he joined the Customs and Border  But this wasn't good enough for what his mother characterized as a brave, strong defender of people. Brian decided to join the elite Border Tactical Team of the Border Patrol unit.  Seven years ago today, Brian was part of a four-person team tasked with pursuing and apprehending a ``rip'' crew. This rip crew has been alleged to be affiliated with the Mexican drug cartels. What they did was exploit those who took advantage of the unwillingness of those in leadership in this country to perform that basic, principled responsibility, which is to secure our borders.                              {time}  1300  The rip crew would rob drug mules as they carried drugs across the border, but would also routinely detain and shake down those who snuck through our porous borders. This cartel-affiliated rip crew had weapons, and they used those weapons to rob, terrorize, and exploit in the worst possible ways people who were essentially invited here by our failure to do our jobs.  Seven years ago today, Brian Terry and three of his colleagues set out not just to protect our border, but to protect innocent people, who came with their entire life savings, because we chose to leave that border porous.  Yesterday, the House Homeland Security Committee took up H.4433. H.4433 is entitled Securing DHS Firearms Act of 2017. We learned during testimony on this bill that in a 2-year period, just over 200 firearms were stolen from people who worked for the Department of Homeland Security, or lost. At least one person was killed by these firearms. I would concur that that is unacceptable.  I certainly support the bill, but having served in the United States Army as a leader of soldiers on deployment, all of whom were issued at least one weapon, I wonder if it literally requires an act of Congress to suggest that the DHS promulgate regulations to oversee the loss or theft of DHS supplied weapons.  Yes, over 200 weapons is horrible. Yes, one life lost is horrible. But should there be an act of Congress?  Because, as I recall, as a leader in the army while deployed overseas, we had protocol for dealing with lost weapons, with lost sensible items, and with lost We didn't need an act of Congress to tell us to promulgate it.  While I support this bill, it began to make me wonder and then think of a Bible verse, Matthew 7:3:  ``Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?''  Certainly it is unacceptable that over 200 weapons should be lost or stolen from DHS employees in a period of 2 years. But it is, quite literally, one-tenth of the scale of the weaponry that our government intentionally put into the stream of commerce to be used by those who would visit harm not only on their neighbors and family members south of our border, but right here on our own soil.  So, weapons like this, to the quantity of over 200, were lost or stolen from members of Meanwhile, 7 years ago, weapons like this were put into the stream of commerce by our very government. Weapons like this took the lives of at least one person. Weapons like this, put into the stream of commerce by our very government, have taken, at the very least, 70 times as many lives.  Yesterday, the Committee on Homeland Security promulgated a bill--an act of Congress--to address 200-some weapons like this that have cost at least one human life. And 7 years after Brian Terry set out on patrol that fateful night in Arizona, days before he was to fly home to Michigan to see his family for Christmas, nobody is talking about the weapons like this that our government intentionally placed into the stream of commerce, where we knew, to a metaphysical certainty, they would go to those who would do harm to their neighbors and their families and  Seven years later, we have seen justice. The killers of Brian Terry have been arrested. The first man arrested for having shot Mr.Terry in the back with a military-style rifle, leaving him to bleed to death in the medical chopper that flew him out in an effort to save his life, had, I think, ironically, already been deported from this country seven times.  The night that Brian Terry set out to protect not only the borders of this Nation, but the people who seek to enter it because we will not uphold our responsibility, the man who killed him was about robbing the very people who were coming here because we allowed it by not doing our jobs, and he had already been deported seven times.  Now, we know that close to 70 people have died because we intentionally, as a nation, put into the stream of commerce military-style weapons. In fact, we have lost track of over 1,400 of the over 2,000 weapons that the Obama administration thought it would be a good idea to intentionally let go to Mexico.[[Page H9930]]  The weapon pictured next to me is a Barrett M-82 .50-caliber anti-personnel and -materiel rifle. There are Members of this body who have spoken on how this weapon should be illegal because, conceivably, it can take down an airplane.  Why do I digress?  Because that weapon was recovered in the hideout known to be used by the most notorious murderer in North America in the last 100 years: El Chapo  The United States Government watched while a weapon that some Members of this body would suggest can take down an airplane was trafficked to a man who is trafficked in death to the point where the next slide I show will blow any thinking person's mind.  Many of the 160,000, roughly, deaths of civilians in Mexico can be traced directly back to this man. And we know, because it was recovered, that at least one of the military-style weapons that he received came from us.  So, 7 years ago today, an American hero named Brian Terry, who had served as a law enforcement professional, as a marine in Iraq, and on the elite border tactical squadron, set out to protect America, but to also protect those who sought to enter it, whether legally or illegally. And, when he did so, he did so understanding fully, as those who take an oath to defend this Nation do, that some things in this world are worth standing, fighting, and dying for. And, tragically, 7 years ago tonight, Brian Terry made that sacrifice.  I had no intention of standing and speaking on this today until H.4433, the Securing DHS Firearms Act of 2017, came before the Homeland Security Committee yesterday, but it struck me as ironic. Not only did I serve in uniform as a combat arms officer for nearly 6 years, but I spent just under 10 years as a prosecutor, and I have a passion for a number of things, but foremost among these is justice.  So while it gives my heart some condolence, I can't begin to imagine the feelings on the 7th anniversary of the family members of this American hero, knowing that, while the people who pulled the trigger have been convicted, the weapons that they used were provided to them by the very Nation that he died to protect.  Mr.Speaker, with that, I would submit this: I have faith that in life or after life, there will always ultimately be justice.  I will tell you this: In the case of those who, with intent, put the firearms into the hands of the individuals who took the life of this American hero, I hope that justice comes in this life and not the next.  So, while we move about our business of promulgating laws to dictate to the DHS that they should have a policy to address the loss of firearms, I hope we don't take our eye off the ball of the very firearms that we intentionally trafficked, like the two that were recovered from the scene of the murder of Brian Terry, and that we will continue until we find it to seek justice for this man and act in a manner such that there are no more Brian Terry tragedies going forward.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgH9929.txt,1737,BORINQUENEERS POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,14.0,December

668,topic-id,339,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4171, a bill I introduced with Congressman Connolly, to extend Federal agencies' authority to conduct a telework pilot program.  The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 provided Federal agencies, and specifically the U.Patent and Trademark Office, with the authority to conduct a pilot program to incentivize telework. The pilot program allows agencies to waive the reimbursement of travel costs for teleworking employees who return to headquarters for mandatory training programs.  Both agencies and employees benefit from this arrangement. Agencies benefit from having an additional tool for recruitment and retention. Agencies also realize cost savings by allowing employees to work at different locations.  For example, according to the USPTO, its telework program saved $77.4 million in fiscal year 2016 alone. The savings are related to lower real estate costs and increased personnel retention.  In turn, teleworking employees can work from almost anywhere in the United The teleworking program moves USPTO employees into the communities that they serve. For example, in my State of Montana, the pilot program allowed the USPTO to place patent examiners in Bozeman, Butte, Billings, and  Teleworking can grow opportunities in our communities that aren't close to highly populated areas that house Federal agencies. It has the promise of bringing more good-paying jobs to Montana and other rural areas across the country.  Now that agencies are seeing the cost savings associated with telework, this pilot program can be wound down. Absent congressional action, this program expired last week. However, the USPTO has requested an extension in order to allow it to budget for increased travel expenses related to paying for employees to return to agency headquarters in northern Virginia or one of its regional offices. This bill extends the program for 3 years.  I thank the congressman from Virginia (Mr.Connolly), for working with me in a bipartisan fashion to bring this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgH9814.txt,99999999999999,SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,12.0,December

118,topic-id,1517,"Mr.Speaker, I do appreciate the concerns of my friends here in Congress because this is just incredible.  You know, many of us have read, understood what happened during Watergate, and we thought surely there have been enough things put in as checks to prevent an administration from totally co-oping the Department of No one President should be able to have an administration that is powerful enough that it could be a self-sustaining party where all of the powers, whether it is the IRS that has people in key places that prevent people from guilt giving, for example, proper tax status to opponents of an administration so that they stand a better chance of being defeated in running for a second election.  It happened in the Obama administration. And to the great embarrassment or what should be embarrassment of the Obama administration, of the IRS, and of the United States Congress, nothing was done. It appears crimes were committed. Nothing was done.  We are just aghast.  How could this happen?  Surely the DOJ would jump into the IRS and correct this and stop this so that the IRS could not be weaponized as a political tool. I mean, Nixon may have dreamed of that at some point, but we are not aware of it.  I mean, it is just hard to believe that anybody would anticipate using the powers of government in such a flagrant form as we are finding out almost every day now. New allegations, not just--not allegations; new facts show that corruption and political animus and anything but justice was being conducted for a number of years in the Department of  You know, as an assistant district attorney in east Texas, as a judge getting to know and hearing so many different Federal agents testify, most people felt like, gosh, if the FBI comes in, these are the guys in the white hats. But much of America has seen what can only be styled as real corruption that has turned those white hats into a stinking brown for some of the top people.  We heard Christopher Wray, the FBI Director, saying: You know, I think of the FBI and I think about these thousands of great Federal agents across the country who care about their country and protecting people's lives and protecting the law.  Well, yeah, I think about that, too, until my mind comes back here to Washington, and not just a swamp, but areas that have become a cesspool. It is unbelievable to think--I mean, I saw ``All the President's Men'' the other night about Watergate and Deep And as I watched, oh, my gosh, you mean somebody in the White House may have had contact with somebody that may have had funds that could be used?  I mean, you look at what is coming out in the news every day and it makes that look like Keystone Cops--nothing compared to the extent that this administration used the Justice Department.[[Page H9835]]  And going back to the IRS, what did Rosenstein or all these other great Justice Department officials do for us in cleaning up the mess at the IRS?  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  What did Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch do to clean things up?  Well, they just kept dumping more and more dirt in that washing machine.  Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, then you find that a reporter sees the husband of someone being investigated in a clandestine meeting, in an area they thought nobody would notice.  And what do they want to do at the Justice Department?  We find out they want to go after that reporter. They want to go after that reporter because this reporter actually was reporting some things that might help get some things cleaned up.  They say: We don't want things cleaned up. We want to keep our little cesspool tight and friendly, where we know all the players and all the swamp rats.  We have got to have a massive clean out of what has been happening, but it is not happening.                              {time}  1800  Then we find out, gee, there was this investigation regarding Russia trying to violate the law, pay bribes, pay payoffs, anything they could do to corner the market on uranium and get United States uranium in their own control. And, gee, who ends up having their fingerprints on that? A guy named  In fact, then you see one of the people involved in the investigation of corruption and uranium and payoffs, well, there is Rod Rosenstein's name. Now, he has an assistant sign for him asking the judge to seal the records so we can't know exactly what all was done by the  It is kind of like we find out there is someone, the undercover agent that the FBI was using, that the Justice Department was using, and they get an agreement, a nondisclosure agreement. I mean, the only reason I can think of they would want a nondisclosure agreement at the FBI is so that the informant wouldn't turn around and talk about how dirty they have been. I mean, why would they get a nondisclosure agreement?  I might expect the guy who was the informant demanding a nondisclosure agreement from the FBI and from the Justice Department: You can't talk about what all I did; you can't talk about the things I did because the people I was working undercover for you on, they might try to kill me, so I demand a nondisclosure agreement from the Justice Department, from the FBI, so you won't disclose things that will get me killed.  But, no, that is not what happened. Under the Obama administration, Loretta Lynch ``Injustice Department,'' we have a nondisclosure agreement that the person who risked his life couldn't disclose what was going on. Sounds like somebody, to me, at the FBI and the Justice Department had a pretty dirty conscience and they didn't want to be outed. And at every turn: Oh, well, that was sealed. Oh, well, that is a nondisclosure agreement. Oh, you can't have access to that.  The FBI and the Justice Department and people that we have been questioning have really kind of gotten themselves in a position where they are above the law. They are above And in this country, the branch that the Founders thought would have the least control ever--that was the judiciary; they are small; they don't really have any power--they are legislating and running the executive branch from under their robes.  At the same time, you have got the executive branch and the Department of Justice that has become a new playground for people who want to write like Kafka, ginning up charges, knocking down doors in the wee hours of the morning: Oh, were they a threat?  Well, no, not really, but we just need to intimidate them. It is what we do in the Justice Department nowadays. We are the Department of intimidation.  I am telling you, Mr.Speaker, there has got to be a material change. There has got to be. There are too many people currently in the Justice Department and the top of the FBI--not these fine young agents across the country who have given everything they had, even though Mueller removed their ability to have wise counsel because he got rid of the long-toothed people that had the experience and the wisdom to know how to bring these agents along. He purged the training materials so FBI agents could not know how to discern if somebody had been radicalized.  There is just so much, that almost needs to start from scratch; and we are having to deal with the players like Rosenstein who have been in that system as they were part of the process while it was corroding and, really, infecting.  I thank my friends for caring enough about what is going on to stand up and raise But, like I said, you know, just when you think, well, that has got to be the final shoe dropping, then we have this story that the wife of the demoted DOJ official actually worked for the firm that put together, was behind, the anti-Trump dossier that we believe may very likely have been used in order to surveil the Trump campaign, in order to use the DOJ, working in collusion with not only Russia, but also the Hillary Clinton campaign, in order to elect a candidate who had no chance otherwise.  Well, a funny thing happened on the way to using the DOJ and Fusion GPS and the Russians in order to get Hillary Clinton elected--she didn't get elected. But that certainly doesn't owe anything to Nellie Ohr or Bruce Ohr or these people who have been occupying the Department of Justice as it tainted and turned from, what Christopher Wray says, an F that stood for ``fidelity'' to, now, an I that stands for ``infidelity.''  Let's get back to fidelity in the Justice Let's get back to an incorruptible Justice I am hoping and praying we are heading that direction, but I am just not seeing it yet.

273,topic-id,3722,"Mr.Speaker, I heard my colleagues across the aisle discussing the issue of Special Counsel Since there are one or two possibilities about some of the things they said regarding Republicans, especially on a committee, either Mr.Cohen's memory is terrible or he is falsely, intentionally misrepresenting things.  I am not saying that is the case. I am saying it is one or the other, and I will get to that momentarily.  The hearing we had this week in the Judiciary Committee with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was deeply troubling to those who want the Department of Justice to be about justice; those who want to see the FBI be that great arbiter, that great entity that will ensure that justice is done. We need an entity like that.  The ATF, their reputation was sorely soiled back during the attack by the ATF on Waco at the facility where some folks had been sucked into basically a cult. It didn't have to happen. And as we found out, local law enforcement said that they knew that David Koresh went to Sam's Club right there on Belle Meade--I think they said And if the ATF had told us they wanted to arrest him, we could have helped them arrange to pick him up as he walked out of Sam's Club with grocery sacks in his arms. There would have been no incident. No lives would have been lost, no children burned up in a fire, no people killed. It was so unnecessary, but the ATF apparently wanted to make a point and wanted to have a big show. Actually, there were constitutional issues there.  I read in the paper that a gentleman who served with me at Fort Benning in Georgia, during my time in the Army, had advised the post commander out at Fort Bliss that he should not allow the U.Army tanks or equipment to be used, in violation of the posse comitatus, unless he had a direct order from the President himself.  As we found out after the fact, the President made clear that: Oh, that was Reno's deal. You have to talk to her about that.  So, clearly, he did not order the U.military to use equipment and allow their equipment to be used against civilian American citizens. So there were all kinds of terrible things that came out and it really made the ATF look bad.                              {time}  1415  I was a fan of the ATF, the Federal I knew them to have done some great things, and I had some very dear friends, and still do have some very dear and very great friends, who are in the  But the point is that such horrendous judgment in the ATF set up what they knew or should have known would probably result in losses of lives, including severe injuries to ATF themselves. I don't think they lost anybody, but they certainly were severely wounded and treated there in But that kind of outrageous judgment that puts political and news interests ahead of just doing the job and seeing justice done ends up being such a terrible blot on the reputation of any entity that it is hard to work back from that.  I still hear people who refer to that incident nearly 25 years ago, and still it is such a blot on the ATF that it is hard for people to consider the ATF without thinking how terribly, just inappropriate, the ATF acted at times and caused people to wonder: Is that the general rule, or was that an exception? People, after some other episodes, began to think it is the rule with the Some claim: Let's get rid of it.  What has gone on now and is currently going on now with the Deputy Attorney General taking all three positions that he sees no evil, he hears no evil--he doesn't know of any evil going on. He thinks everything is like the poet said: ``God's in His Heaven, all's right with the world.'' I believe the author had a little girl saying that.  But it is not right with the world. It is terribly wrong. America and the world sit in a position of Western civilization where potentially the most incredible and amazing strides in healthcare, in energy, and all kinds of areas of life on this Earth have been made better exponentially, and the United States of America is at the very heart of those great developments.  A majority in the United States throughout our history would always say: We call those blessings from  Now, maybe it is and maybe it isn't a majority, but we are ever getting closer to a position where this grand experiment in self-judgment is potentially on the verge of being lost. History is not being taught as zealously as it once was. Places like Hillsdale College or Liberty or Regent, there are some places where it is being taught. I had fantastic history teachers, which is what I majored in at Texas A&M because I knew I was going to do 4 years in the Army, at least, and if we were at war when my 4 years were up, I would have continued to serve.  But our students don't know history anymore. Why? Because President Carter decided that the Federal Government intervention into education, even though it is not an enumerated power under the Constitution, and it is, therefore, a power that is reserved to the States and the people and not the Federal Government, we have been acting extra-constitutionally, that means outside the Constitution, for quite some time going back to the late seventies under President  Our students have suffered as a result. They don't know history. Someone had advised me that even though history is not an important part of the federally mandated test, there are things that in different subjects are mandated by the Federal Here is an element that students should know about the subject. I was advised that the one area that the federally mandated test, the only area historically that students were required to know, is that when the United States dropped two atomic bombs, one on Hiroshima and one on Nagasaki, it raised serious questions about the United States' morality, which is absolutely fictitious unless the ignorance of the authors requiring such a thing did not allow them to know the truth.  The truth is that Truman was advised that because the Emperor of Japan had ordered the Japanese people to fight for their homes to the death, then the Allied Forces would have to land in They would have had to move across the country, and it was considered a very fair and possibly quite conservative estimate that there could be 10 million people losing their lives if Allied Forces had to land and were fighting the Japanese people home to home to home.  So the morality of the issue is: Would we morally be better off in this absolute war that the Japanese started[[Page H9937]]against the United States, would we be better off losing the horrible tragedy of 300,000 or so lives, or would we be better off having 5 or so million Japanese people killed and 5 or so million Allied Forces being lost?  The morally correct decision was that a Democrat, a man who apparently really wrestled with the issue from a moral standpoint, decided to put the American bombers at risk, those flying the planes and taking the atomic bombs, and to put 200,000 or 300,000 or so people at risk in an effort to avoid losing 5 million or so Japanese and an equal number or more of the Allied I think he made the correct moral decision.  So that doesn't raise moral issues about the United It raises ignorance issues about the federally mandated test. We would be so much better off if we got back to allowing local school boards to decide and States to decide--as they had been for many decades--deciding what their students should learn. That was the beauty of a federalist situation where States would have so much power.  But as is often the case when the Federal Government takes over an area like education, then it gets worse. I was on the board of directors of the Texas A&M Association of Former Students, and I can recall the president advising us that the official SAT had to change the scoring system for the SAT because students across the board were doing so much worse than they did when classes around my era, in the 1970s, had done, that we had done, overall, so much better than the students who came through after the Federal Government took over education.  So I don't know if it was accurate, but I had educators back at that time say that there is a formula; so it is hard to say. But if you scored, say, 1,400 out of 1,600 on the SAT in the seventies, then under the new scoring system it would probably be scored closer to 1,600, 1,500 to 1,600, maybe a couple hundred points that they had to add to the system, because after we had a Federal Department of Education, then students started doing worse. So to keep it from looking like the Department of Education here in Washington made education as poor as it helped to do, we had to raise the SAT scores basically on an arbitrary basis.  We know that the students coming through in the eighties, nineties, and then this new millennium have the potential to do better than we ever did, but because the Federal Government got involved, I don't think it is just a great irony when the Federal Government took over education under President Carter that, wow, ironically, isn't it amazing, at the same time students were doing worse and worse. So that is what often happens when the Federal Government gets involved.  We saw that with If they had gotten the help of the local law enforcement, there would have been no loss of life, in all reality, but the ATF was going to bust in and make a big show out of it, and it cost an awful lot of lives.  You would like to think that, when the FBI comes in, you don't have to worry, they are going to do the right thing. I know so many incredible, outstanding FBI agents. But for Mr.Cohen to continue to say, even after he has been advised and reminded that I have been raising Cain about Robert Mueller for over a decade, I guess, he came in, sworn in in January of `07, as I understand it. Initially, when I questioned Robert Mueller as FBI Director when I first got to Congress, I was carrying that image of the great FBI, the image that so many of the agents still carry, thousands of them still carry, but with more and more difficulty because of the cesspools that have developed here in Washington and the way in which it has been used, as we saw with the IRS, during the Obama administration, weaponized and used as a political instrument.  Now, how do we know that? We didn't know near as much as we continue to find out, but Robert Mueller ran off thousands of years of experience, and I contend it was because he wanted nothing but yes people. He didn't want the experienced people around the country who might try to point out to the director when he made one of his many mistakes as FBI Director or chose software programs, chose law enforcement programs that created problems because they had more experience than he did, he did not really want people around the country to have more experience than he did because they might question something that he ordered inappropriately, and he just wanted people to salute him, salute the flag, figuratively speaking, and drive forward.  That means when Mueller wanted somebody to bust down the door in the middle of the night, even though there was no threat of the individual fleeing, no threat of the individual hiding evidence, it was done, as we are now seeing the Mueller special counsel group, team, SWAT unit, unofficial SWAT, of course, but we are seeing them use these types of tactics.  Now, I don't really know Paul He doesn't seem like a fellow that I would enjoy getting along with. Nonetheless, it certainly appeared that he was very materially mistreated because Mueller wanted to make sure he got his point, and he knocked down the door, or at least went in in the middle of the night, however they got in. We have heard this before, this heavy-handed Federal Government, and there was no reason for that other than bullying, mean, Federal agents at the top wanting to bully people around.  We saw that kind of conduct with Mike Flynn as he was set up. He had been, as part of the transition team, talking to people at the FBI about different issues, and now we know Strzok was part of that, this man that absolutely loathed President-elect Trump, he loathed everything about Trump and those he was going to be bringing into office. We didn't know how badly they despised or loathed the President and Republicans supporting him until we got more information.                              {time}  1430  But these kind of things are things that Robert Mueller should have known. He should have known the Department of Justice's reputation and hope for being considered righteous was all riding on him and what he did. Yet he rode in with his black hat--figuratively, for those in the mainstream media who don't understand those type of references--and he began to overreach.  We heard yesterday from the guy that appointed Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, that, to have a special counsel, you have to believe that a crime was committed. So it would seem to reason that Mueller was appointed to investigate something that they had reason to believe that possibly a crime had been committed.  Yet because of whether it is incompetence or zeal in wanting Mueller to go on a witch hunt, to just keep searching until you find something, even if it is a poor guy like Scooter Libby who devoted his life to helping his country, we need somebody's scalp. It doesn't look like Donald Trump was colluding with the Russians, so we have got to have somebody's scalp. Let's intimidate some people. Let's bully our way into homes in the middle of the night. Let's do whatever we have got to do and maybe we will scare somebody into admitting something.  Like many are saying, Michael Flynn didn't lie. To be a lie, you have to have intent to deceive. But whether they are right or wrong about that, the word is he was bankrupted by an overzealous bully.  All my friends on the left are talking about bullying. I was small for my age. In my class, I was bullied. I had a black eye, a bloody nose. A fifth grade teacher, after a big bully took my football and I tried to get it back and ended up with a bloody nose and a black eye--our teacher loved the bully back then--pulled me in front of class while I was trying to get my nose to stop bleeding and told the class: This is what happens when little boys try to play with big boys.  I know something about being bullied and I recognize it in a government group when I see it. The Mueller team has been bullies, but that is what Mueller wanted. Why do you think he went and hired Weissmann, who destroyed thousands and thousands of employees' lives who worked for Arthur Andersen in a joust at windmills that cost these people their livelihoods, caused more pain and suffering than imaginable, for what the Supreme Court said, 9-0: You are a fool. This was not a crime. You made this up?  That is who Mueller wanted on his team. This is the same Robert Mueller, as I have been pointing out for years,[[Page H9938]]who has been grossly unfair in running off the thousands of years of experience that he did so he could have great people, wonderful people.  Not only were they new and young, but he was eliminating the older folks who had the experience that could bring them along, because Mueller wanted them created in his image and to get rid of all the wisdom of the ages that could be found throughout the FBI before he took over.  I am sure there are a bunch of people that needed to go, but you don't destroy an entire entity like the Federal Bureau of Investigation just because you want a bunch of yes men. That is what Bob Mueller did. That man shouldn't have been close to being a special counsel. He couldn't stand  As the Washingtonian magazine was glorifying James Comey--I believe it was in a 2013 issue where they said, basically, in essence, if the world were burning down, James Comey knew that the one person who would be standing with him would be Bob Mueller--Comey is the very guy who admitted leaking information out in order to try to get a special counsel appointed.  As I covered with Mr.Rosenstein yesterday, this is part of an FBI typical employment agreement. Everybody is supposed to sign this thing and swear to it: ``All information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of I will surrender upon demand by the FBI, or upon my separation from the FBI, all materials containing FBI information in my possession.''  If a man like Comey goes to a meeting in his official capacity of FBI Director with the President of the United States and he comes out of this and types up a memo, even though it appears it was a pretty less than unbiased memo trying to make President Trump look bad, so he commemorates it with a memo, that memo, as I discussed with Mr.Rosenstein yesterday, is probably government property. That is government information, government property. And the question is: Did he commit a crime when he leaked that information?  There is a decent chance it is, yes.  So where is the FBI in its investigation of James Comey's potential crime?  When you look at the record and you go back, now we know from that one incident this is the person to whom he leaked, and then that got to The New York Well, here is another meeting where he was the principal character there, the most likely person to have leaked.  Well, lo and behold, his same conduit for leaking information that he has admitted to ends up being in place in this story. There may be at least six other places where he has leaked information, and some of them will be crimes, but because the special counsel was all about trying to strip the winner of a Presidential election, we are not going after We are not going after any of these other people. They are trying to find something.  As we know from the text messages of FBI Agent Strzok, they wanted an insurance policy so that, in case Trump won, they could still get rid of him. Poor Strzok believed that no one in this country should vote--not a single person, not even Donald Trump's family--should vote for him. It ought to be 100 million to zero.  But, Mr.Speaker, it is so clear, in my days of trying cases in Federal court and State court, where you are asking questions of a jury panel to see who would be fair enough to sit on a jury, we can see that these people who were working and have been--and some still are--for the FBI, for the Department of Justice, have no business getting close to this investigation unless they are a target of investigation.  Andrew Weissmann should never have been a part of the special counsel team.  Peter Strzok, this is only some of the text message he sent, but he says:       He asked me who I'd would vote for, guessed  It goes on:       God Trump is a loathsome human.       Yet he may win.       Good for       It is.       Would he be a worse President than Cruz?       Trump? Yes, I think so.  This, of course, is an exchange between Peter Strzok, or PS, and his mistress, Lisa Page, who is also working for the These people had done irreparable damage to the But worse than that, they have made a mockery of justice in the United  What really gets me is I know how upset I was in the Bush administration when I saw somebody doing wrong. I didn't care if he was appointed by a Republican or a I didn't care that President Bush had appointed a man or a woman to a position. What I cared about was them being righteous and doing the right thing.  Now, where is my Democratic friend who will stand up and say this isn't right?  We know Alan Dershowitz, a great Democrat, brilliant intellect, has done it. But where are people across the aisle who would do what I did during the Bush Presidency, pick up the phone and say: This is an outrage. What has happened under this Attorney General should never have happened. He has got to go?  Where is the Democrat who has a sense of moral outrage when the justice system is just shaken to its core by people who want to take out a President because they didn't support him, they didn't want him to be there, they didn't think any American should vote for him, and they are destroying the sense of justice and our justice system?  It is time for Americans to wake up. It is time to clean house, get rid of Mueller, and get some fair people in there to investigate.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1021,topic-id,3713,"Mr.Speaker, I enjoyed hearing my friend from Illinois first talking about the great State of It truly is. We appreciate all the doctors who have been sent down to Texas after we did tort reform and Illinois continues to have significant problems.  We had had problems keeping doctors in Texas until the great State of Illinois ran into greater and greater malpractice lawsuit problems. Texas did tort reform, and we started having doctors coming from places like Illinois to Texas, and we are doing much better.  The problem is, with health insurance, I heard my friend talk about 13 million who won't have insurance, and I think, to be fair there, are so many millions right now who are forced to do the unthinkable.                              {time}  2045  It is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court simply chose to become political in their decisionmaking rather than constitutional. You could pick nine people off the street at random and probably six or seven out of the nine, after they heard the dispute and read the Constitution, would find contrary to the Supreme  We put so much magic, supposedly, in those black robes. Somehow, they are given more credibility than they ought to be. Thomas Jefferson thought that the judicial system would be the weakest of the three branches, but now it pretty much controls everything.  Under ObamaCare, people are forced to buy a product. For the first time in American history, you can be forced to buy a product. If you didn't, you would be fined, punished, taxed. The Court said, on one hand, it wasn't a tax. Therefore, the Court had jurisdiction. Forty-some pages later, it said it is a tax, so it is constitutional.  In any event, people have been forced to buy a product and they have paid for as cheap a policy as they could get away with, but the deductibles were so high. I have heard this over and over hundreds of times in my own district. They were buying insurance they will never be able to use. The deductibles are so high, they don't have that kind of money.  So what the repeal of the individual mandate is going to mean is that people can still buy the insurance if they want to. They are not going to be penalized if they don't buy it.  But in order for ObamaCare to work, it is stealing from Peter to pay In other words, young people, for example, were having to buy insurance they would never use because they would have the deductible. But they did the calculation: Do I pay more if I pay for the insurance or do I pay more if I pay the extra income tax? Then they make that decision.  What the repeal of the individual mandate means is that we will help the Supreme Court in their ridiculous ruling and the mental gymnastics that went into not calling it a tax at page 13 or so, and then 40 pages later calling it a tax.  It is really pretty absurd, but it was a political decision. John Roberts was intimidated into believing that, if they struck down this unconstitutional bill, he would be deemed to be Chief Justice over the most political As a result of what he did, he goes down in history as having the most political Court since Dred It wasn't quite as bad as the Dred Scott decision. That has got to be the worst.  We know from history that sometimes they just get it wrong. We will do the right thing by the American people, and we will repeal the individual mandate. Unfortunately, it is not going to start for a year.  I also heard my friend mention--and I have heard others say--that this bill will end up putting most of the income in the hands of the top 1 percent.  One of the great things about being in Congress is you get to learn so much if you are paying attention.  My friends can go back and look at YouTube and find President Obama, after being in office for a number of years, admitting that, for the first time in American history, 95 percent of the Nation's income went to the top 1 percent income earners. It never happened before.  But under the policies that do as President Obama said he was going to do before he got elected--and that is spread the wealth around--every time somebody tries to spread the wealth around--it is a socialist idea, a communist. But when you try to spread the wealth around, it never seems to fail that the richest, most powerful get richer and more powerful.  You can go to the Soviet There were a handful of people making a lot of money, even over there now, under Of course, Putin gets richer. But there were a handful of people who get rich and most of the people don't. Most of the people bring in about the same amount of income, but they don't have access to the same benefits.  Anyway, we are going to move in a direction away from what President Obama's policies established, and that was, as a fact, 95 percent of the Nation's income is going to the top 1 percent. We want to get away from that.  Reforming the Tax Code and getting away from the punishing days of President Obama's policies will allow the working class to do better for the first time in years. They have been flat-lined or less when adjusted for inflation. It is time they did better.  The tax bill we should take up tomorrow will end up doing that. It will get money into the hands of the working poor, the middle class. We saw the middle class shrink under President Obama; the poor got poorer, the ultrarich got ultraricher, and the middle class shrunk.  More people--over 50 million, as I recall--signed up for food stamps. That has already dropped significantly under the policies of the current We are hoping that the policies that we will push through together with the President will continue to have that effect. People will do better. There will be more jobs.  With all of the ridicule of lowering the corporate tax, if people will just be realistic and honest about it, corporations don't pay corporate taxes. They have to pass that on as a cost of doing business to their customers, their clients, those who purchase their goods or services. They pass that 35 percent tax on.  I know that before the President got elected, the current President, he had talked about maybe putting a tariff on Chinese goods. The fact is we have been putting on a 35 percent tariff, the highest tariff anybody puts on its own goods and services of all the industrialized nations. It is the biggest.  If we knock that 35 percent down, then it means our goods will be more competitive around the world. It means more jobs. It is going to be a great thing for It really is. As much as some people despise the President, like it or not, it is going to help make America great again.  Lower the corporate tax. I wish we could have kept it at 15 percent. Apparently, the powers of the leaders of the House and Senate, by a margin of two-to-one against the President wanting it at 15 percent, but at least we are getting it lowered. That is going to mean more goods can be competitive abroad. It means more jobs here. It means more manufacturing back here.  For those who have got their nose in the air and think we shouldn't have manufacturing in America, you go around the world and see manufacturing in other places and you see it here. It is about as clean a manufacturing company as you can have. This is the best place for those jobs because we do have to breathe the air that China and India pollutes, which we are cleaning up, but not near fast enough because they are polluting it so much.  Fortunately, the President withdrew from the so-called climate accord. The reason all these other countries wanted the United States in is because we were the ones that were going to send checks to all the other countries. We were going to pay guilt money. We have no guilt to pay for.  In fact, this is the country that is helping clean up the air and water, unlike other large nations in the world. They owe us a check, if somebody is going to be owing checks for the amount of pollution. It should mean a better economy.  There is one other thing that severely hurt our country under the past administration.  I am not normally a big fan of Politico's articles, but this is a fascinating one that calls itself: ``The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah Off the Hook.''[[Page H10177]]  Hezbollah is recognized as a terrorist organization. This is entitled: ``The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah Off the Hook.''  Part one starts with a ``Global Threat How Hezbollah turned to trafficking cocaine and laundering money through used cars to finance its expansion.  ``In its determination to secure a nuclear deal with Iran, the Obama administration derailed an ambitious law enforcement campaign targeting drug trafficking by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, even as it was funneling cocaine into the United States, according to a Politico investigation.  ``The campaign, dubbed Project Cassandra, was launched in 2008 after the Drug Enforcement Administration amassed evidence that Hezbollah had transformed itself from a Middle East-focused military and political organization into an international crime syndicate that some investigators believed was collecting $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities.''  So, that was 2008, during the Bush administration, with Robert Mueller as head of the  This points out: ``Over the next 8 years''--that would be as we went into the Obama administration, 2009--agents working out of a top-secret DEA facility in Chantilly, Virginia, used wiretaps, undercover operations, and informants to map Hezbollah's illicit networks, with the help of 30 U.and foreign security agencies.  ``They followed cocaine shipments, some from Latin America to West Africa and on to Europe and the Middle East, and others through Venezuela and Mexico to the United They tracked the river of dirty cash as it was laundered by, among other tactics, buying American used cars and shipping them to And with the help of some key cooperating witnesses, the agents traced the conspiracy, they believed, to the innermost circle of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran.''  It is rather ironic. I got in the car a moment ago and heard my good friend, Mark Apparently, he had read part of this story on the air and had a call from a person they didn't fully identify who was one of these agents who was helping track what Hezbollah was doing.  The article says: ``But as Project Cassandra reached higher into the hierarchy of conspiracy, Obama administration officials threw an increasingly insurmountable series of roadblocks in its way.''  Parenthetically here, so the Obama administration had found that Hezbollah was massively producing and getting into the United States drugs that were addicting American young people--well, of all ages, but especially our young, our future--making a billion dollars or so, and they were dying as they got hooked on worse and worse drugs. The answer of the Obama administration, according to this article, was throwing an increasingly unsurmountable series of roadblocks in the way of those investigating Hezbollah and the evil infliction of harm they were doing to                              {time}  2100  The article goes on:  `` . . . according to interviews with dozens of participants, who, in many cases, spoke for the first time about events shrouded in secrecy, and a review of government documents and court records. When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests, and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury Departments delayed, hindered, or rejected their requests.''  That would be Bob Mueller at the He had already purged the FBI training materials so that FBI agents, as they came in, would not know what questions to ask. So when they went out to interview Tsarnaev, after we got a heads up that he was a terrorist--he had been radicalized--those FBI agents didn't know what to ask.  Why?  Because Bob Mueller purged the training material. So they didn't know what to ask. They didn't know what to look for in a radical They went and asked his mother, and she said: No, he is a good boy. He is not a terrorist.  There were people who died because of Bob Mueller purging the FBI training materials; so they didn't even know what they were looking for.  And when I was cross-examining him before our committee, I said: ``You didn't even go out to the mosque where they attended to investigate them.'' He indicated that they did go out to the mosque in their outreach program, where they sit down and play ``Pat-a-Cake,'' share a meal, and the last thing they do would be to inquire about one of the mosque attendees being radicalized. They didn't bother to do that. They were too busy making merry in their outreach program.  He also testified on one occasion that the Islamic community is like every other religious community in America; and they had this wonderful outreach program with them, and it is working so well.  So I asked a question: ``Well, you said the Islamic community is like every other community in America, and you have this wonderful outreach program with them, so let me ask you: How is your outreach program going with the Buddhists, and the Jewish, and the Baptists, and all of these other communities?''  Well, they don't have an outreach program to any except the Islamic community. So that told me then: this isn't just like every other community. They don't have outreach communities through every other religious community in America because they are not worried about them blowing up innocent people, to the extent they apparently were before Mueller came along.  In any event, back to this article:  ``The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah's high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.''  So the Justice Department--during that period, of course--would have been Eric I believe I saw him in the news recently. He had forgotten how he was in contempt of Congress, how he covered up--obfuscated--crimes that appeared to be occurring under his watch. And now we find out, just days after his high-profile blasting of what was going on here, trying to get to the truth, it turns out he was obfuscating, just like we found he was doing, hindering and obstructing justice.  We really needed a special counsel to investigate him. But, of course, he was not going to have a special counsel investigate himself, nor was Loretta Lynch going to allow a special counsel to investigate Eric Holder and Loretta We still need one to investigate both of them. And the more we find out, the more it points to this desperate need.  It has this in the article from December 15, 2011:  ``Hezbollah is linked to a $483,142,568 laundering scheme. The money, allegedly laundered through the Lebanese Canadian Bank and two exchange houses, involved approximately 30 U.car buyers.''  Then it goes on and shows in the article, from the Southern District of New York, U.Attorney's Office:  ``Manhattan U.Attorney Files Civil Money Laundering and Forfeiture Suit Seeking More Than $480 Million From Entities Including Lebanese Financial Institutions That Facilitated a Hezbollah-Related Money Laundering Scheme''  `` `This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision,' said David Asher, who helped establish and oversee Project Cassandra as a Defense Department illicit finance analyst. `They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.' ''  That would be from President Obama, it would be from Eric Holder, and it would be from Bob  Bob Mueller should have been honest and sincere enough when he was asked to be special counsel, and should have said: I am probably going to be investigated myself. I am not in a position to be the investigator.  Because he certainly should be investigated. And this is one more story.[[Page H10178]]  ``The untold story of Project Cassandra illustrates the immense difficulty in mapping and countering illicit networks in an age where global terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized crime have merged, but also the extent to which competing agendas among government agencies--and shifting priorities at the highest levels--can set back years of progress.''  And that is exactly what happened under Bob Mueller and President Obama's administration.  And this 56-page article appears very well documented, and it actually appears well done. It has John Brennan in here creating problems for the investigation into the drugging and laundering of money to help finance terrorist operations.  And one part of this is they killed this investigation. They were afraid it would prevent the Iran agreement from going forward. Well, it didn't go forward. It was never constitutionally ratified. The Corker bill was just that: it was a bill. It could not turn the Constitution upside down, as it attempted to do.  The Constitution makes clear that it takes two-thirds of the Senate to ratify a treaty. It doesn't matter what the bill says; it will only take one-third to ratify a treaty. It doesn't work that way. If you want that to be the law, it takes a constitutional amendment to do that. We didn't have one. Therefore, it took two-thirds to ratify, and the Iranian agreement is still not ratified.  But, nonetheless, though it wasn't ratified, it didn't keep the President from sending $100 billion or so in dollars over to We know Iran is the largest producer of IEDs in  As I sat at the funeral of this precious, young 20-year-old gentleman, who went to my daughter's high school, Alex Missildine, killed by an IED, I just sat there going: I wonder if the money President Obama sent paid for the production of the IED that killed our precious Alex?  It has been paid. It is paying for something. We know that Iran is using it--Certainly part of their military operations are continuing to kill Americans in other places.  Yet you had Project Cassandra that was closing in on Hezbollah, closing in on the drug production, drug sales, the laundering of money through the used car, shipping used cars around. And then, lo and behold, a reminder of what has happened right here on Capitol Hill that Luke Rosiak has been pursuing.  Here is an article from February 20, 2017, from the Daily Caller, entitled: ``House Dem IT Guys In Security Probe Secretly Took $100,000 in Iraqi Money,'' from a Hezbollah tie.  The article says:  ``Rogue congressional staffers took $100,000 from an Iraqi politician while they had administrator-level access to the House of Representatives' computer network, according to court documents examined by The Daily Caller News Foundation's Investigative  ``The money was a loan from Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure, and was funneled through a company with `impossible'-to-decipher financial transactions that the congressional information technology, IT, staffers controlled.  ``Imran Awan, ringleader of the group that includes his brothers Abid and Jamal, has provided IT services since 2005 for Florida Democrat Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former Democratic National Committee, DNC, chairwoman. The brothers are from  ``The trio also worked for dozens of other House Democrats, including members of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Homeland Security Those positions likely gave them access to congressional emails and other sensitive documents.  ``The brothers, whose access to House IT networks has been terminated, are under criminal investigation by the U.Capitol Police.''  ``Investigators found that congressional information was being copied to an off-site server and they suspect the brothers of improperly accessing information and stealing congressional property. Chiefs of staff for the employing Democrats were notified February 2.  ``Soon after Imran began working for Members of Congress, Imran's and Abid's wives--Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova--also began receiving congressional paychecks, the DCNF found. Imran's employers included two members of the Intelligence . . .  ``By 2009, the family was simultaneously managing a full-time car dealership in Virginia, with Abid running day-to-day operations after contributing $250,000 in startup cash.

You owe somebody for an illicit car dealership, and you can't pay. Just put them on the House employee system; and they will be on the congressional payroll, and you can pay off $250,000. That must have been a heck of a percentage, though. They borrowed $100,000 from this guy with Hezbollah contact, and they have to pay him back $250,000. Of course, in their case, they were very fortunate, because they did it with the House payroll. There is no evidence that Mr.Abbas ever lifted a finger to do any work, and for good reason. We wouldn't want him involved in all of the inner workings of our computer systems on the Who knows. Maybe he did.

The teams on both sides of the aisle, the chairman of the full committee, and the chairman of the subcommittee have worked really hard to advance this important bill, and I thank them.  Hydropower is an essential component of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity to expand renewable hydropower production. However, without some much-needed licensing improvements, we risk losing investment opportunities in new hydropower infrastructure.  In particular, closed-loop pumped storage hydro projects offer the opportunity to store energy for use when it is needed. In essence, it is a giant natural battery. H.2880, the Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower Act, establishes an expedited licensing process for these projects.  This bill cuts unnecessary red tape that currently accompanies approval of these projects, hindering energy security and job creation.  I am excited about the possibility that some are exploring to build these facilities in abandoned mines and/or the coal fields of central As a part of this, H.2880 also requires FERC to hold a workshop to explore the potential opportunities for development of closed-loop projects in abandoned mine sites.

If we can repurpose some of these mines or bring jobs in to central Appalachia that don't currently exist, it is an energy region and it is a region that understands the energy issues, and as people want to get rid of coal--I support keeping coal--but all of the above requires we also do hydropower.  I urge my colleagues to help us create new jobs in these regions by supporting this bipartisan, commonsense legislation promoting closed-loop hydropower development.

The persecution of Christians is a global human rights problem that Congress needs to address. According to Open Doors' 2017 World Watch List, approximately 1 in 12 Christians around the world is experiencing persecution for their faith.  North Korea, which is one of the world's most repressive regimes, is a serious violator of international religious Christian rights, which is not surprising, given it is a communist country. Communist countries throughout history have done what they can to suppress and destroy  Human rights groups have reported that members of underground churches in North Korea have been arrested, beaten, tortured, or killed.  In another communist country, China, religious groups, including Christians, are required to register with the government. Those that do not face imprisonment and torture.  In 2016, 232 Protestants were imprisoned for their religious activities. As part of the country's anti-cross campaign, some 2,000 crosses and buildings have been demolished since 2014, according to State Department estimates.  In the Middle East, the Islamic State and other jihadist militant groups have forced Christians in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and other countries in the region to flee or risk enslavement, execution, or death. Since the U.invasion of Iraq in 2003, the number of Christians in Iraq has plunged from 1.5 million to just a couple hundred thousand.  In Libya, ISIS and other extremist groups have gained a stronghold in the country since the fall of Qadhafi.[[Page H9823]]  I reluctantly have to point out that the Christian persecution going on in Libya and Iraq has happened after the United States decided to get involved in these countries, so we have a special responsibility to look out for the Christians there.  In Egypt, ISIS claimed responsibility for killing over 70 Coptic Christians earlier this year.  The persecution of Christians in the Middle East doesn't end with terrorists. It is institutional, as well.  Pakistan has some of the most extreme blasphemy laws in the world. In June of 2016, two Christians received death sentences for blasphemy convictions.  In Iran, approximately 200 Christians were arrested last year. At least 90 remain in illegal detention.  Acts of persecution against Christians across the globe is a violation of international law, which is why Congress must act.  Sadly, in our own country, the United States, sometimes Christians can be forced to participate in ceremonies with which they don't agree. It is kind of hard to believe that this is going on in the United States of  407 will condemn the persecution of Christians around the world. It calls for all discriminatory countries and groups to cease their persecution of religious minorities and urge world leaders to uphold the universal human right to religious freedom.  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution.  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgH9821.txt,2276,DACA,2017.0,12.0,December

He submitted his DACA renewal well before the application deadline that was arbitrarily set for last But he made a mistake. His check was for $465, not $495, so he will be deportable as of December 22.

725,topic-id,888,"Thank you, Mr.                            Net Neutrality  I rise today to join my colleagues to oppose the Federal Communications Commission's planned vote tomorrow to dismantle net neutrality rules. As this proposal has been considered, I have been troubled by the impact this decision will have on consumers and small businesses, as well as by the process itself, which has been seriously flawed with regard to gaining public input on this critical issue.  Access to a free and open internet is at the forefront of the lives of nearly every Consumers, entrepreneurs, innovative small businesses, and, in turn, our Nation's economy, have all benefited from equal access to content on the internet, no matter the internet service provider. An open internet has been essential to civic engagement, social and economic mobility, and the fight to make progress for our underrepresented populations, just as we saw with the national Women's March at the beginning of this year, which was largely organized through online activism. An open internet is critical to our economy and our democracy, and net neutrality has guaranteed this equal access. But tomorrow's vote by the FCC would change all of that.  Under the plan from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, the control of the internet experience will be taken from the consumer in Keene or the small business in Nashua and handed over to their internet service providers. Undoing net neutrality would give broadband providers the power to discriminate against certain web pages, applications, and streaming and video services by slowing them down, blocking them, or favoring certain services while charging more to access others. This is particularly disturbing at a time when many consumers have, at most, one or two options for broadband providers, leaving those who don't like the steps a provider is taking without a choice to change.  Additionally, dismantling net neutrality rules will hurt small businesses and will stifle innovation. Under these rules, internet service providers would be allowed to force businesses to pay to play online. While larger, well-established companies would likely be able to compete, startups and entrepreneurs across the Nation might not be able to afford such fees, causing instability and limiting the reach of their new businesses.  In New Hampshire, innovative small businesses are the backbone of our economy, creating good jobs and stimulating economic growth. But undoing net neutrality could limit the ability of that next great business to get off the ground.  A Manchester small business owner recently wrote to my staff to say: ``I believe that Net Neutrality should stay in effect as it allows every business to be on the same footing.'' The business owner also said that under this proposal, ``If you are leveraging the internet to boost your business, it will affect it dramatically.''  That business owner is not alone. Just today, several members of the rural and agricultural business community in New England, including Stoneyfield from Londonderry, NH, wrote to Chairman Pai to say: ``Repealing net neutrality would have a crippling effect on rural economies, further restricting access to the internet for rural business at a point in time where we need to expand and speed this access instead.''  Hundreds of people have called my office to voice their support for net neutrality. People across the Nation recognize that the plan proposed by the Republican-led FCC will truly impact their way of life.  In response to Chairman Pai's proposals, millions have also written to the FCC to state their position on this issue, but it seems that this process has been corrupted, with internet bots placing hundreds of thousands of comments in favor of repealing net neutrality. Roughly 400,000 of those comments may have, it seems, originated from Russia email addresses. Additionally, 50,000 consumer service complaints have been excluded from public record, according to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the National Hispanic Media  On any FCC decision, public input is vital, and on this decision, which impacts every single American, it is unacceptable that the public's opinion may have been distorted by fraudulent comments and additional anomalies.  Last week, I--along with 27 of my colleagues--wrote to Chairman Pai calling for a delay in this vote until we have a clear understanding of what happened during the policymaking process. Unfortunately, Chairman Pai has continued rushing toward this vote, and, as has been all too common with the Trump administration, the Republican-led FCC is favoring the priorities and voices of corporate special[[Page S7999]]interests rather than listening to hard-working Americans who want to keep net neutrality.  The Commission has failed to address the concerns that these comments are artificially generated, has not held one public hearing on net neutrality, and is moving forward at an alarming pace, without regard for what eliminating these rules would mean for our economy and our consumers.  Undoing net neutrality will fundamentally change the concept of a free and open internet that so many Granite Staters and Americans have come to know and have benefited from. Approving this plan would be a reckless decision.  I am going to continue fighting for priorities that put consumers first, that help small businesses innovate and thrive, and that advance an open and free internet.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

447,topic-id,859,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes of debate. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action came before Congress, I made my objections very clear. I believed then, as I do now, that the Iran deal too quickly removed the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, allowing Iran to remain a nuclear threshold state.  However, like it or not, the JCPOA is now law, and it will be wrong to undermine it for purely political reasons. Unfortunately, that is, in my opinion, what my Republican colleagues are doing here today. This is not the way to handle our country's foreign policy.  Mr.Speaker, the most important question that you need to ask yourself at this time does not have to do with the substance of the legislation this rule provides for, but, rather, why on Earth this body is wasting what precious legislative time remains to bring these bills to the floor today.  The checklist of important items that need to be addressed is long and time is short. Thanks to the inability of my Republican colleagues to govern, even within their own conference, we face the specter of yet another government shutdown next week. The Band-Aid that Republicans came up with last week to provide funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures some 9 million children, expires at the end of the year. Utah, Colorado, Arizona, California, Ohio, Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and Oregon are just some of the States that have had to inform families that CHIP funding is nearing its end.  Why is this? Historically, the Children's Health Insurance Program funding has been a largely bipartisan effort. And why shouldn't it be? We are simply talking about helping to cover roughly 9 million low-income children and pregnant women.  It has been over 2 months since CHIP's authorization lapsed, and it is far past time for a sensible solution to this problem. Does today's legislation solve this issue? No, it does not.  We also have 800,000-plus DREAMers waiting for word from this Republican-[[Page H9856]]controlled Will my friends across the aisle allow these fine young people to remain in the only country they have ever known as home? Will you let those DREAMers who have served this country bravely stay in this country so that they may start their own families here in the United States, start their own businesses, and go to college?  The idea that my friends would drag their feet on such an issue, let alone actually allow DREAMers to be deported, is anathema to what this country stands for, and it will darken the beacon this country has been for millions of people since our founding: a place where those of differing backgrounds but dedicated to freedom and the rule of law come and make a life for themselves.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans control the House; they control the Senate; they control the White House; and what has that control translated into for the American people? Absolutely nothing at this point. In fact, it is looking increasingly more like the first year of a unified Republican government in over a decade will end with nothing getting done.  In an attempt to distract from their failures, Republicans have taken to blaming, and I quote them, ``obstructionist Democrats.'' They point to this side of the aisle as the cause of their governing woes. That is a neat trick, but the American people are not going to fall for it, and I think you saw that last night in Alabama where new stars fell on  It wasn't the Democrats who tried to take healthcare away from 32 million people. It was Thank goodness they failed. It is not the Democrats who are trying to give the wealthy and rich corporations a tax break on the backs of hardworking It is the I hope this equally misguided effort likewise fails.  I have some advice for my Republican friends. If, like this side of the aisle, you spent more time working on policies that help the American people instead of the wealthy and rich corporations that are doing just fine, you would likely see more legislative success.  Democrats remain ready to work in a bipartisan way to accomplish all that remains left to do this year. We are ready to fund the government and provide for smart investments for the future of our country. We are ready to pull the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers out of unnecessary limbo and provide them with the status they deserve. We are ready to provide the funding and authorization needed to give millions of low-income children the health insurance they need.  The list goes on and on. But, Mr.Speaker, if Republicans continue to not even allow Democrats in the room to address these issues and if they continue to burn legislative time on the bills we have before us today, then it won't be just the Republican majority that pays the price. It will be the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up the bipartisan bicameral bill H.3440, the Dream  Just last week, a group of 34 of my Republican colleagues sent a letter to Speaker Ryan urging a vote before the year's end on legislation that would protect the DACA recipients. This means, if we defeat the previous question and bring up the Dream Act, the bill would garner enough bipartisan support to pass the House today.  Mr.Speaker, I ask how much longer will this body be complicit in the Trump administration's assault on DREAMers? It is time we listen to the vast majority of Americans and this body and act to protect these courageous young people.

464,topic-id,636,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, as we approach the end of 2017, and with just a few legislative days left, the Republican majority is focusing on the wrong things. Plain and simple, the bills before us today are more evidence of that.  Over the next couple of weeks, we face a terrifyingly long to-do list, the outcome of which will affect every single  Let me be very clear. My friend from Maine and my friend from Texas, my friend from Maine, especially, passionately put forward significant matters having to do with My recollection is that I, for one, as did many members of the Democratic Party, voted for the transparency that he calls for and are likely to do so again.  While this is an important matter, it is not nearly as critical at this time that we be occupying this kind of legislative time. The simple fact of the matter is we could have put this on the suspension calendar and not been exercising ourselves in the Rules Committee, occupying legislative time that could be addressing the Flood Insurance Program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and intelligence tools that keep this country safe that are about to expire.  We could have been addressing the hurricane relief for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and southwest  We could have been addressing the fires in California, Oregon, Montana, and other areas of the country.  We could have been addressing the flood in Texas that devastated portions of that area, as well as, during that same period of time, we had tornadoes and other issues indicating how critical it is that we support these matters.  We could have been dealing with a real infrastructure measure. Everybody in this country knows that our roads and bridges are in despicable shape at this point, and it is not as if we do not have the ability to do something about it. We don't have the political will.  So we are wasting legislative time here today with these daunting tasks before us, and this is what the Republican majority chooses to focus on: trying to pass a tax bill, for example, that gives most of the benefits to the wealthy and rich corporations while adding over more than $1 trillion to the deficit.  I have said before: Look out. When we finish whatever this tax bill is--and now it is being called what it is, a tax cut and not tax reform that is needed in this country. When we finish with that, the next words out of many of my colleagues' mouths next year are going to be, ``We need to address the entitlements,'' meaning Medicare, Social Security, and I can assure you that that is what we will hear from my former deficit hawk friends who are now in charge of this country.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, for the sake of the American people, to abandon this reckless tact and return to regular order. That is something that we are not doing and have not done. We have had more closed rules in this session of Congress than in the history of the United States  They need to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way. I think Alabama told us that last night, and I hope that that message is pervasive and allows for us in this body, as well as in the other body, to understand the importance of everybody, all of these brilliant people that Americans sent here to work, to work together to solve many of the issues of this country and address its needs in a meaningful way, not the needs of the wealthy few. Given everything there is to do, anything less is abdication of our duty as legislators.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

275,topic-id,441,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize a longtime member of the Senate family who is concluding his tenure with us as this session comes to a close. His last day of service in the U.Senate will be December 22.  Steve Johnson, a resident of Annandale, VA, and a native of Freehold, NJ, is retiring as the manager of the Senate Dining Room after 22 years of service.  Steve has managed the Senate Dining Room with hospitality, professionalism, and graciousness. He is extremely knowledgeable about the history of the Senate Dining Room and has introduced many of our guests to the stained-glass George Washington Memorial Window, which is often the focal point for visitors.  The window was purchased by the Federal Government for the Capitol in 1910 from the artist, Maria Herndl, for $1,000. The window's Revolutionary War scene shows President George Washington on his white horse conversing with Marquis de LaFayette and Baron von Steuben, the drillmaster of the American I only know the story behind the painting because Steve told me.  Steve sure knows his history, but his primary focus has always been on his team and the Members of this body. Under Steve's leadership, the Senate Dining Room has been an ideal venue for conducting the important business of the U.Throughout his career, he has been responsible for overseeing and implementing the requests of Members of the U.Senate and has done so with efficiency, poise, and thoughtfulness.  Steve has always been resourceful and, at times, creative. Once, a former Senator who, at the time, happened to be the Vice President of the United States, ordered a lunch that had not been on the Senate Dining Room menu for several years, but thanks to Steve's ingenuity, Vice President Joe Biden enjoyed his chopped salad immensely.  On another occasion, Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist stopped by the Senate Dining Room after a long day on Capitol Hill and ordered chocolate chip cookies and milk.[[Page S7973]]The cookies were not on the menu, nor were they in the kitchen, but they still showed up at the Chief Justice's table, thanks to Steve's quick thinking and resourcefulness.  Remarkably, during his Senate service, Steve also found the time to train and compete in 18 marathons. He has qualified and run the Boston Marathon seven times, and I hear that more marathons are in his future.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I wish to express our deep affection and gratitude to Steve Johnson for his 22 years of faithful service to the U.We will miss him dearly. We wish Steve and Joanne, his wife of 32 years, a happy and healthy retirement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgS7972-3.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,12.0,December
397,topic-id,762,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I want to start with a question.  Why is this bill so long?  Last year, we had a bill, H.5729, to block the sale of Boeing aircraft to It was short and clear. It was only 2 pages long. I didn't like it and I didn't support it; but the truth is, I always respect people putting forth their honest beliefs.  H.5729, last year, blocked the licenses to sell U.planes--straightforward. Torpedoing the plane sales endangered the JCPOA because, as we have indicated, it is an affirmative requirement and an obligation on the U.to approve plane sales if a sales agreement is reached. That was part of the deal: You won't build or continue to develop nuclear weapons, we will do certain things, including sell you planes.  Everyone knew what the bill would do and they could decide if they thought that was a good idea or a bad idea. It was very straightforward. It was effectively a proxy on the  This year, we have another bill to block the sale of aircraft to It is neither short nor clear. In fact, it is six times as long as last year's bill.                              {time}  1800  It subjects the licenses to an ongoing and complex certification requirement. It literally names and shames U.banks providing financing. And, again, it does this purposefully so that it might deter the sale of airplanes so that it might undermine the  Frankly, what I interpret, what I have heard this evening, is tantamount to that. This is, yet again, a proxy on the If you are against the JCPOA, vote ``yes.'' If you are for it, vote ``no.''  This bill, however, obscures its end purpose, that objective of undermining the JCPOA behind process and ambiguity. Why?  If you oppose the sale of aircraft, oppose it. Have the courage of your convictions. Don't just engage in this fearmongering. No matter how many times you say that people in Iran chant ``Death to Israel, Death to America,'' and whatever other form of fearmongering you engage in, at least have the courage of your own convictions. You did last year.  Stand up for what you believe in. If you want Iran to buy Airbus aircraft instead of Boeing aircraft, then say that. Stand up for yourself. Stand up for what you believe.  But let's be clear. That is what this bill will do. Don't dance around.  For my part, I think blocking the sale of American planes is a big mistake on so many levels. Let's be clear. It doesn't deny Iran the use of aircraft; it just will deny them American-made aircraft. It will deny American machinists jobs to work on them.  And need I remind anybody here what it means to be an engineer or a machinist at an aircraft company in this country? It means the kind of jobs that we all aspire to for our constituents. You know the kind; the kind that pay enough that you can buy a home, have decent healthcare, save enough money to send your kid to college if you want to, have regular vacations, and have a secure retirement. Those are the kinds of jobs we are taking away if we pass this bill.  It doesn't just prevent Iran from misusing aircraft, as has been suggested. It just prevents Americans from having maintenance and service agreements that keep eyes on the aircraft because, you see, if Airbus sells them these planes, we have no idea. If they are American-made planes, they come with after-sale maintenance and service agreements. We will have eyes on the planes.  It doesn't force Iran back to the bargaining table. It just jeopardizes and cuts the legs out from under the gains we have made in the JCPOA that I thought my colleague and friend from Connecticut spoke about so eloquently. We don't go to sleep at night worried that Iran is getting closer to a bomb, as we would have, as North Korea has.  So my friends, in summary, passage of this legislation will do three things:  Number one, it will cost America jobs, and good-paying jobs;  Number two, it will make us less safe because it will undermine the JCPOA and, in so doing, not allow us to ensure that these planes are not being used for a nefarious purpose;  And number three, it will actually make us less safe as well, in the sense that if it does, in fact, defeat the purpose of JCPOA-- The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Walberg).

508,topic-id,496,"I thank the ranking member, Mr.Chairman, for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, this bill targets the leadership of Iran, and, frankly, that is probably a worthy goal in some regards. I think it eventually envisions publicizing negative information about them, and that might be an effective tool as well. We all know that. We have been through campaigns. We know negative advertising works.  That said, I oppose this legislation, and I do so for two reasons. The first is resources are finite. They are not unlimited; they are finite. Tracking down all the assets of these named Iranian leaders takes significant time, effort, and personnel.  Where are those resources supposed to come from?  All around this city, everybody is agitating for deeper cuts to nondefense discretionary accounts. If we are going to make cuts, we are going to have to make some tough choices.  The personnel responsible for implementing this bill would be diverted from terrorist financing and money laundering. Let me say that again. The people, the personnel responsible for implementing this bill would be diverted from terrorist financing and money laundering.  Propaganda about corruption of Iranian leadership--which I stipulate to here up front--could be valuable, but it can't be more valuable than stopping actual terrorist financing. Terrorist financing should be our target. Money laundering should be our target, not garden-variety corruption.  We had a lengthy discussion in committee just yesterday about using money laundering authorities to fight human trafficking. For God's sake, that has to seem more valuable than propaganda. It has to.  So until we solve these tight budget constraints, I think we need to make the hard choice about what our priorities are and how to prioritize resources for stopping, again, money laundering and terrorism financing. Leave this effort for a world where the sequester has been lifted.  The second reason why I oppose this legislation, I can't help wondering: Shouldn't we apply this principle more broadly?  The idea here is that we should investigate and publicize it when a country's leadership has undisclosed assets, especially if those are overseas. That is the point of this legislation. We should investigate and publicize it when a country's leadership is using government resources to enrich itself. But why--why--just apply that principle to Iran?  I am informed in my point of view here by wisdom I found in this black, leather-bound book that I gratefully received when I was sworn into office 5 years ago. In fact, the passage that I will cite you actually occurs in two places. Let me share it with you now:  ``How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you, yourself, fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.''  So I wonder: When is this Congress going to turn its attention to the plank in our eye?  ",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgH9868.txt,2040,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,December

The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                               H.4324       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Oversight of      Iran's Access to Finance Act''.     2.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),      informally known as the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama      administration agreed to license the sale of commercial      passenger aircraft to Iran, the world's foremost state      sponsor of terrorism and a jurisdiction of primary money      laundering concern.       (2) In April 2015, prior to the adoption of the JCPOA,      Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew, in publicly advocating      for its provisions, stated: ``Make no mistake: deal or no      deal, we will continue to use all our available tools,      including sanctions, to counter Iran's menacing behavior.      Iran knows that our host of sanctions focused on its support      for terrorism and its violations of human rights are not, and      have never been, up for discussion.''.       (3) In March 2016 remarks to the Carnegie Endowment for      International Peace, Secretary Lew, in reference to U.     commitments under the JCPOA, stated: ``While we have lifted      the nuclear sanctions, we continue to enforce sanctions      directed at support for terrorism and regional      destabilization, and missile and human rights violations.''.       (4) In an April 2016 forum at the Council on Foreign      Relations, Secretary Lew stated that, under the JCPOA, the      U.committed to lifting its nuclear sanctions, ``but the      U.financial system is not open to Iran, and that is not      something that is going to change''.       (5) In September 2016, the Department of the Treasury's      Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued licenses      permitting the export of up to 97 aircraft for use by Iran      Air, the Islamic Republic of Iran's flagship state-owned      carrier. These licenses included authorization for U.     financial institutions ``to engage in all transactions      necessary to provide financing or other financial services''      in order to effectuate the sales. In November 2016, OFAC      licensed an additional 106 aircraft for purchase by Iran Air,      which are also eligible for financing authorized by       (6) The Department of the Treasury had sanctioned Iran Air      in 2011 for its use of commercial passenger aircraft to      transport rockets, missiles, and other military cargo on      behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and      Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, both      of which had been designated under Executive Order 13382 for      weapons proliferation-related activities. In October 2017,      the IRGC went on to be designated under Executive Order 13224      for its support of the IRGC-Qods[[Page H9881]]     Force, which has provided support to terrorist groups such as      Hizballah, Hamas, and the       (7) Among Iran Air's sanctionable activities, the airline      delivered missile or rocket components to the Assad      government in Syria, which like Iran is classified as a state      sponsor of terrorism.       (8) The Assad regime is responsible for a civil conflict      that has claimed an estimated 400,000 lives, including      through the government's deployment of chemical weapons and      barrel bombs against unarmed civilians and children.       (9) Despite being delisted in 2016, Iran Air has continued      to fly known weapons resupply routes to government-controlled      areas of According to research by the Foundation for      Defense of Democracies, between Implementation Day of the      JCPOA on January 16, 2016, and May 4, 2017, Iran Air operated      at least 134 flights to Syria, which included stops in      Abadan, Iran, a suspected IRGC logistical hub for airlifts to      the Assad regime.       (10) In November 2016 correspondence to the Chairman of the      House Committee on Financial Services, the Department of the      Treasury noted that the commitment to delist Iran Air under      the JCPOA ``does not affect our ability to designate, or re-     designate, any Iranian airline that engages in sanctionable      activity. The United States retains the ability to designate      any individual or entity that engages in sanctionable      activities under our authorities targeting conduct outside      the scope of the JCPOA, including Iran's support for      terrorism, human rights abuses, ballistic missile program,      and other destabilizing activities in the region.''.

387,topic-id,1257,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to support H.4324, which is a commonsense piece of legislation sponsored by my good friend and fellow Texan, Mr.His work as a member of the Financial Services Committee and as vice chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee has been invaluable.  Mr.Speaker, as our colleagues know, under the Iran nuclear bill, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the Obama administration committed the U.to license the sale of aircraft to  In addition to authorizing the sales, these licenses have authorized banks to engage in financing, even though Iran remains classified by the Treasury Department as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. On top of that, the State Department continues to label Iran as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism.  The recipient of these aircraft would be Iran Air, the state-owned airline that was sanctioned as recently as 2011 for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which itself has been designated by the Trump administration as a terrorist organization. So, Mr.Speaker, so far, so bad.  And yet, while I and many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle find these aircraft sales and their financing deeply disturbing, Mr.Williams' bill is about something far, far simpler. All[[Page H9882]]his bill would do is bring about the implications of the aircraft finance for Iran out into the sunlight. In other words, Mr.Speaker, it is a reporting requirement--nothing more, nothing less.  It would simply require Treasury to help Congress understand who is involved in these transactions. If it is an airline, has that airline stopped supporting terrorists or other sanctioned persons. If it is a bank, does that bank have the due diligence in place to guard against the immense illicit finance risk endemic to  All this legislation does is have Treasury certify this information for And, if Treasury can't make those certifications, it simply has to notify us what plans it has in response, even if it has no plans in response.  So, when we hear today from the other side of the aisle how this bill may impose new conditions on Iran or somehow stand in the way of commitments under the JCPOA, I suggest, again, everyone read the bill. It is simple. It is common sense. In fact, we should be considering this under the expedited process of the suspension calendar.  This legislation provides, again, for a simple reporting requirement, Mr.Speaker; that is it, a reporting requirement.  If my friends who oppose this bill don't care enough to even request the information from the executive branch, especially information that may reveal the use of their constituents' bank deposits for the benefit of enablers of terrorism, well, Mr.Speaker, that is a sad, sad day for congressional oversight and a sad day for the United States  But there are people who have read the bill, if everybody in this institution hasn't, people, for example, associated with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who wrote recently in a November 22 policy brief for the Foundation's Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance: ``The proposed bill supports Treasury's robust licensing approval process by codifying steps that are likely already central to the Department's evaluation process.''  They go on to write, Mr.Speaker: ``While not imposing any new standards for the approval of sales to Iran, codifying the existing standards in law through this bill makes the licensing process more transparent and gives the American people--through their elected representatives--a clear picture of a significant component of the sanctions relief provided to Iran under the nuclear agreement.''  Mr.Speaker, I include this report in the    [From the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, 22, 2017]   Congress Supports Financial Transparency for Iranian Transactions                   (By Annie Fixler, Tyler Stapleton)       The House Financial Services Committee approved last week      the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act,      which codifies in law a set of conditions that the U.     Treasury must use to evaluate licenses for the sale of      commercial aircraft to       The bill requires the secretary of the Treasury to report      within 30 days whether transactions related to the export and      re-export of aircraft to Iran pose a ``significant money      laundering or terrorism financing risk to the United States      financial system.'' The secretary must also determine whether      the transactions benefit any Iranian person that has      knowingly transported or otherwise supported the      proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or provided      material support to persons included on Treasury's sanctions      lists. If the secretary cannot certify that the transaction      meets these conditions, he must explain whether the licenses      authorizing the transaction will be revoked, modified, or      remain valid despite the potential for illicit transactions      or benefits going to sanctioned persons.       Under the July 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint      Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the United States      committed to allowing the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran      provided the planes are used ``exclusively for commercial      passenger aviation.'' The JCPOA specifically states that if      aircraft are either used for a prohibited purpose or      transferred or re-sold to individuals or entities on      Washington's sanctions lists, the U.would view this as      grounds to cease its approval of aircraft sales--but, by      implication, not abrogate the nuclear deal in full.       Upon the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016,      Treasury issued a Statement of Licensing Policy (SLP) and      additional guidance reiterating and expanding on the relevant      language from the nuclear deal. The SLP and related guidance      indicate that Treasury would view license applications      favorably but would review applications on a case-by-case      basis and ``include appropriate conditions to ensure'' that      no sanctioned persons were involved in the transaction.       The SLP and related guidance are clearly consistent with      the JCPOA, which does not require the United States to issue      licenses for aircraft sales without conditions. Accordingly,      the SLP does not guarantee that all applications will be      approved. If Washington determines that certain criteria are      necessary in order to ensure that commercial aircraft are      used appropriately, it is permitted to reject an application      that does not meet those criteria.       The proposed bill supports Treasury's robust licensing      approval process by codifying steps that are likely already      central to the department's evaluation process. First, for      more than two decades, Treasury has been at the forefront of      efforts to implement global anti-money laundering and      counter-terrorism financing standards. The bill emphasizes      that these standards should be a critical component in the      evaluation of licenses vis-a-vis Iranian aircraft      transactions. Second, the bill's requirement that no persons      knowingly supporting proliferation benefit from the deal      mirrors Treasury's statement that no persons on sanctions      lists be involved in the transactions.       While not imposing any new standards for the approval of      sales to Iran, codifying the existing standards in law      through this bill makes the licensing process more      transparent and gives the American people--through their      elected representatives--a clearer picture of a significant      component of the sanctions relief provided to Iran under the      nuclear agreement.       The most novel component of the bill is that it requires      the secretary of the Treasury to issue a report listing all      U.or foreign financial institutions that have conducted      authorized transactions in connection with the export or re-     export of commercial aircraft to While not classified,      this information is not currently part of the public record.      Objections to the publication of a list of companies and      banks involved in aircraft sales revolve around exposing      businesses to reputational risks for transacting with      Yet it is unavoidable for there to be reputational risk for      doing business--even legal business--with the world's leading      state sponsor of terrorism.

410,topic-id,583,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, from time to time in my Congressional career I come to the House floor, and I have a surreal moment. Iran is the world's foremost state sponsor of terror, and we have Members on the other side of the aisle saying: Well, we shouldn't learn anything about them. We shouldn't learn about who is financing their aircraft. We shouldn't learn whether or not aircraft will be converted for military purposes.  Iran is a regime where every day the leadership wakes up shouting: ``Death to Israel, Death to America.'' Yet I have friends on the other side of the aisle who say: Well, we shouldn't have any reporting on Iran because it might hurt their feelings.  This is a surreal moment, Mr.Speaker, an absolute surreal moment. We have been told over and over that somehow this stops the JCPOA, the nuclear deal with I wish it did, but it doesn't. I would suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they actually read the bill, it is 10 pages long, 6 pages of findings. You can put the findings aside and read the 4 pages. It is a reporting bill.  It has certifications. And guess what the implications are if the administration can't give the proper certifications? The deal continues to go on. It is perhaps the single worst foreign policy agreement in the history of America that legitimizes Iran's nuclear program and, on its best day, slows up their nuclear weapons by maybe a few years, at best, on its best day.  When the JCPOA was sold to us by the previous administration, we were told: This would be for civilian aircraft use only. Don't worry about it. This is not going to exacerbate terrorism in any way. But we know Boeing itself says their aircraft, which are being sold to Iran, can be used for combat purposes, and, in fact, have been. Iran Air was cited in 2011. It was sanctioned for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been designated as a terrorist organization.[[Page H9889]]  This isn't just theory, Mr.It is a fact. Then we had my colleague, the gentleman from Washington, say: Well, it is important that we sell aircraft to Iran so companies can make profits. Well, using his logic, maybe we ought to sell weapons to North Korea if some company can make a profit. I think not, Mr. There are some things that are more important. Our security is even more important than the profit of any one particular company. So, again, this is a simple reporting requirement.  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Williams) for his leadership here. It is incredibly important that we understand from those who sold us this terrible Iranian deal, they need to make good on their promises.  We need to make sure that civilian aircraft are being used for civilian purposes. We need to make sure that the banks who are financing these deals are not financing terrorism. Yet those on the other side of the aisle say: No, let's put our heads in the sand. Let's just trust--let's trust the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. They will do the right thing. Let's just ignore this terrorism thing.  No, Mr.That is why it is so important that we enact H.4324, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for it.

So here is what is going on, Mr.Speaker: What we have is a regime that wakes up every morning shouting ``Death to America; death to Israel,'' and yet we have a motion to recommit trying to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election.  We have a regime which has been certified as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism whom we are trying to hold accountable and from whom we are trying to get information, and our friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election.  We know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps supports the Assad regime in According to the U.N., the Assad government, with the help of Iran, has now carried out 27 chemical weapon attacks since the start of the Syrian conflict, including an April 2017 sarin gas attack that killed more than 80 people, including scores of women and children, and my friends on the other side of the aisle want to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election.

503,topic-id,1014,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise in strong support of H.1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, introduced by my colleague and dear friend from Maine (Mr.Poliquin).  This legislation requires the Treasury Secretary to report to Congress on the assets held by the Islamic Republic of Iran's most senior political and military leaders, and on the probable sources and uses of those assets.  A classified version, if necessary, would be available, as appropriate, to Congress, and a public version of the report would be posted on the Treasury Department's website in English and in the major languages used within Iran that could easily be downloaded.  The genius of this latter point is that it will allow the average Iranian to understand and circulate information of how their leaders are, in a phrase, robbing them blind, as well as aiding and abetting terrorists.  Iran's top political, military, and business leaders, if there is much of a distinction between those roles in Iran, fund terrorist-related activity, we know this, and through intricate financial arrangements that give them great flexibility in moving their money.  According to the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, Iran's economy is characterized by high levels of official and institutional corruption, and there is substantial involvement by Iran's security forces, particularly involving the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Unsurprisingly, then, members of Iran's senior political and military leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional wealth by using their positions to secure control of major portions of the Iranian national economy.  Some estimates put their iron grip at a third or more of the country's economy, and some individual holdings in the billions of dollars; all at a time when the average Iranian citizen earns the equivalent of about $15,000 a year.  The unwise sanctions relief provided through the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran resulted in the unwarranted removal of many Iranian entities that are tied to government corruption from the list of entities sanctioned by the United                              {time}  1500  Thankfully, however, the Trump administration has, in recent months, levied a number of needed new sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities. Still, the Transparency International index of perceived public corruption in Iran is higher than ever.  As well, the Treasury Department has identified Iran as a country of ``primary concern for money laundering.'' Separately, the State Department has continually identified Iran as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. Iran is, the State Department tells us, a country that has ``repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,'' and ``continues to sponsor terrorist groups around the world, principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.''  The bill before us today, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, requires the Treasury Department again to list the known assets of senior Iranian officials in a form that is easily understandable and accessible to individual Iranians, as well as to those in the financial or business sector who might be concerned--hopefully concerned--about inadvertently doing business with a corrupt Iranian entity.  The bill also requires the Treasury to evaluate the effectiveness of existing sanctions against Iran and make any appropriate recommendations for improving the effectiveness of sanctions.  The bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with a bipartisan support vote of 43-16. The House approved a nearly identical bill just 18 months ago by a very strong vote of 282-143.  As passed by the committee, this year's version has an important addition, a sense of the Congress section, that urges the Treasury Secretary, in addition to other sources, to seek information for the report from private sector sources that search, analyze, and, if necessary, translate publicly available, high veracity, official records overseas, and provide methods of searching and analyzing such data in ways useful to law enforcement.  These source of services provide information that could augment information that is gathered, often by classified means, and provide a final public report that helps give the world a better picture of the true nature of Iran's economy.  Mr.Chairman, I urge immediate passage of Mr.Poliquin's thoughtful and bipartisan bill. I appreciate his leadership to bring us here today, and I reserve the balance of my time.

529,topic-id,2106,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I find it fascinating how often the ranking member criticized our own President and didn't have one critical comment for the President of Iran, the nation which our State Department, including the Obama State Department, has labeled as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. But yet, in the last almost hour we have not heard one single critical word.  We hear much about the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, perhaps one of the worst arrangements, international agreements that has ever been entered into by our country, but look as I may, in the legislation--and it is 9 pages long, not 900--you will not see the JCPOA in it.  Mr.Poliquin's bill, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, is just that. It is seeking to have greater international transparency for the leaders of this rogue nation, regardless of the  Let's remember what the gentleman from Ohio reminded us, that it was because of information, including radio-free Europe, that went across the Iron Curtain that ultimately brought that curtain down and freed millions. We want to make sure the Iranian people know about their own leadership.  Our own State Department has said the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force along with Iranian partners, allies, and proxies continue to play a destabilizing role in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, but the ranking member says: Oh, let's not say anything about their leadership because we might hurt their feelings.  The State Department goes on to say: Iran continued to recruit fighters from across the region to join Iranian-affiliated Shia militia forces engaged in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and has even offered a path to citizenship for those who heed this call. And yet the ranking member says let's not report on the leadership of this rogue regime because they are very sensitive people.  The State Department goes on to say: Hezbollah continued to work closely with Iran in these conflict zones, playing a major role in supporting the Syrian Government's efforts to maintain control in the territory and providing training and a range of other support for Iranian-aligned groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yet we continue to hear from the ranking member that we shouldn't learn anything about their leadership. Again, we might step on their toes after the JCPOA, and we wouldn't want to do that. We wouldn't want to be insensitive to international terrorists.  In 2016, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, boasted: ``We are open about the fact that Hezbollah's budget, its income, its expenses, everything it eats and drinks, its weapons and rockets are from the Islamic Republican of Iran.''  I mean, how much more do we need to know? Why do we continue to have Members of the United States Congress come to the floor of this institution and somehow want to seemingly protect the leaders of this rogue regime?  We want to know more information. We want to disseminate this information. We want the whole world to know about the leadership of the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. It is exactly what the gentleman from Maine is trying to. I salute him for his leadership.  I encourage all Members to vote ``aye'' for his bill.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-47. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:                               H.1638       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Iranian Leadership Asset      Transparency Act''.     2.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Iran is characterized by high levels of official and      institutional corruption, and substantial involvement by      Iran's security forces, particularly the Islamic      Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in the economy.       (2) Many members of Iran's senior political and military      leadership have acquired significant personal and      institutional wealth by using their positions to secure      control of significant portions of Iran's national economy.       (3) Sanctions relief provided through the Joint      Comprehensive Plan of Action has resulted in the removal of      many Iranian entities that are tied to governmental      corruption from the list of entities sanctioned by the United            (4) The Department of Treasury in 2011 designated the      Islamic Republic of Iran's financial sector as a jurisdiction      of primary money laundering concern under section 311 of the      USA PATRIOT Act, stating ``Treasury has for the[[Page H9876]]     first time identified the entire Iranian financial sector;      including Iran's Central Bank, private Iranian banks, and      branches, and subsidiaries of Iranian banks operating outside      of Iran as posing illicit finance risks for the global      financial system.''.       (5) Iran continues to be listed by the Financial Action      Task Force (FATF) among the ``Non-Cooperative Countries or      Territories''--countries which it perceived to be non-     cooperative in the global fight against terror finance and      money laundering.       (6) Iran and North Korea are the only countries listed by      the FATF as ``Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories''      against which FATF countries should take measures.       (7) The Transparency International index of perceived      public corruption ranks Iran 130th out of 168 countries      surveyed.       (8) The State Department identified Iran as a ``major      money-laundering country'' in its International Narcotics      Control Strategy Report (INCSR) for 2016.       (9) The State Department currently identifies Iran, along      with Sudan and Syria, as a state sponsor of terrorism,      ``having repeatedly provided support for acts of      international terrorism''.       (10) The State Department's ``Country Reports on      Terrorism'', published last in July 2017, noted that ``Iran      continued to sponsor terrorist groups around the world,      principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-     Qods Force (IRGC-QF). These groups included Lebanese      Hizballah, several Iraqi Shia militant groups, Hamas, and      Palestine Islamic Iran, Hizballah, and other Shia      militia continued to provide support to the Asad regime,      dramatically bolstering its capabilities, prolonging the      civil war in Syria, and worsening the human rights and      refugee crisis there.''.       (11) The Iranian Government's tolerance of corruption and      nepotism in business limits opportunities for foreign and      domestic investment, particularly given the significant      involvement of the IRGC in many sectors of Iran's economy.       (12) The IRGC and the leadership-controlled bonyads      (foundations) control an estimated one-third of Iran's total      economy, including large portions of Iran's      telecommunications, construction, and airport and port      operations. These operations give the IRGC and bonyads vast      funds to support terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah      and       (13) By gaining control of major economic sectors, the IRGC      and bonyads have also served to further disadvantage the      average     3.

643,topic-id,939,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act, which is an important bill cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Members of the House and a bill that was approved by the Financial Services Committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 2-1, quite literally: 40-20. Additionally, this bill builds upon an issue that has a long track record of strong bipartisan support in  I thank Congressman Trott, a member of the Financial Services Committee, for introducing this legislation and for leading congressional efforts to modernize the privacy notification process for consumers and to provide regulatory relief for our struggling financial institutions.  There is a serious issue, Mr.Speaker, with the sheer volume, complexity, weight, load, and cost of the regulatory burden upon, particularly, our struggling community financial institutions, our community banks, and credit unions.  It is no one specific regulation, but the totality, the combination of them all, are causing us to lose a community bank or credit union a day in As we lose them, our constituents lose their opportunity for credit opportunities to share in their version of the American It makes it more costly, more difficult for them to finance someone to go to college, for them to perhaps buy an auto to get them to work, or perhaps capitalize their own small business. So we frequently hear from our community financial institutions.  I heard from a community banker in Nebraska, not long ago, who explained: ``I have explained about how things have changed since I started in banking 10 years ago. In efforts for our government to make things more fair or easier for consumers, it has actually become increasingly more difficult for people to obtain favorable loan terms and, not to mention, obtain loans in a timely manner.''  I heard from a banker in Alabama about real estate regulations, who said: They were intended to help customers, but it is actually hurting them. As wait times increase and banks are no longer offering certain products, not all of these people can be protected from themselves, no matter how many rules and regs the banks follow to protect them.  I heard from a community banker in Utah, who said: I have been in banking for 29 years. In that time, the regulatory burden has increased dramatically. The ability to help customers and small businesses succeed in rural America has been greatly hampered by regulation intended to protect the customer from Wall Street banks, but in the process, smaller community banks, such as mine, have been caught in the fray or broad brush of regulations.  A banker in Oklahoma said that, because of Dodd-Frank regulations: ``We no longer offer/purchase house loans.''[[Page H9906]]  The list goes on and on and on.  So this is one regulation that simply says: under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, if a financial institution doesn't change their privacy notification, they don't have to send out a piece of paper annually--a piece of paper like this that 99 percent of the time customers throw away and don't read in the first place.  Don't take my word for it. Professor Adam Levitin, who is a frequent Democrat witness before the House Financial Services Committee testified before our committee: ``One thing that I think should go the way of the dodo bird are the Gramm-Leach-Bliley privacy notices. Nobody reads them.''  That is a Democrat witness, Mr.It is not a Republican witness. It is a Democrat witness.  He goes on to say: ``There's no reason anyone should--even the large banks--should be spending money on giving these notices.''  But that is not what this bill does. It just simply says, if a financial institution does not change their privacy notification, they don't have to send out a paper notification that creates more costs, that gets passed on to the customer, and that nobody reads in the first place.  Number one, it is important regulatory relief for our financial institutions. But it is also important when we think in terms of the sheer volume of financial disclosures that our constituents receive.  This goes back to the fact, Mr.Speaker, if you disclose everything, you effectively disclose nothing because you overwhelm the customer.  So we must vigilantly ensure that our constituents are receiving effective disclosure, not just voluminous disclosure, but effective disclosure of material items written in clear, understandable, common language. Again, not voluminous disclosure of irrelevant items written in legalese and fine print. That doesn't do anybody any good, Mr. Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for his leadership. The bill that he is bringing today has earned bipartisan support because it is a simple technical correction to clarify that customers have to be physically mailed an annual privacy notice only when the privacy policies have actually changed from the previous year.  Importantly, this bill was carefully crafted to maintain and retain current privacy and opt-out policies and does not exempt any financial services provider from an initial privacy notice, nor does it allow any loopholes for an institution to avoid issuing an updated notice.  In fact, this legislation, Mr.Speaker, does not change privacy provisions at all, just how they are delivered. Let me repeat: the legislation does not change privacy provisions at all, just how they are delivered.  Again, Mr.Trott's bill has strong bipartisan support. It provides a simple and flexible approach that modernizes privacy notification to the benefit of our customers and to the benefit of our financial institutions.  Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure and urge every Member to vote for it, and I reserve the balance of my time.

658,topic-id,572,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, there have been several surreal moments on the House floor this week, and today certainly is one more of them.  The debate today is not between regulation and deregulation, but in many respects, the debate is between smart regulation and dumb regulation. What we have today is a dumb regulation that forces a number of financial institutions annually to send out a paper notification even if they don't change their privacy policy; cut down trees, engage an expense--by the way, an expense that, my guess is, doesn't come out of executive bonuses, but probably comes out of the credit availability and the credit cost to the customer. It gets passed on to the consumer.  What we are also having a debate about--and I would encourage all my friends on the other side of the aisle, if in doubt, read the bill.  In this particular case, guess what, Mr.It is a 2-page bill. It really doesn't take that long to read. If you read it, what you will find out is that this is a bill that is pro-consumer because we go from a notification that happens once a year to a continuous notification. We improve the consumer notification by ensuring that it is consistently on the website of the financial institution.  What we hear from the ranking member is: I want to stay in the 20th century. Gramm-Leach-Bliley is a law from the 20th century.  But, Mr.Speaker, we are in the 21st century. Why don't we ensure that the privacy notification for the consumer is actually on the website?  This is what is truly pro-consumer, not forcing people to go and subsidize the paper mills and the U.Postal Service by sending out a notification on paper that doesn't change anything and merely confuses consumers. If you are really pro-consumer, then try to respect their markets and try not to pass additional cost on to them.  Again, regardless of what you have heard from the other side of the aisle, this is everything to do with how we notify people of privacy policies, not the underlying privacy policy itself. It is 21st century. It is not 20th century. It is pro-consumer, regardless of all the special interests and Washington, D.C.-based lobbyists that the ranking member has cited.  The gentleman from Michigan brings us pro-consumer legislation, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification I am kind of embarrassed that we are having to spend this much time debating something that should have been on our expedited suspension calendar. It is almost like there is just simply a knee-jerk reaction anytime we attempt to modify any government regulation.  This is pro-consumer. Frankly, it is pro-environment. Every Member of the House should embrace H.2396. I am sorry we have had to take up so much time for it, but there are thousands and thousands of regulations that hurt our financial institutions, that hurt our consumers. We are trying to get rid of every dumb one, one at a time.  Again, this should be passing unanimously. I don't understand it, but I am glad the American people could see this debate for what it is.  Mr.Speaker, again, let's be pro-consumer, let's be pro-community financial institution, let's be pro-environment, and let's enact H.2396.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

This has nothing to do with Wells It has nothing to do with It is limited to the annual paper notification from auto finance companies, pure and simple.  Again, for those who listened to the earlier debate, the question is whether or not these auto finance companies are going to be forced to spend money that comes out of their customers' pockets to send out a paper notification of privacy policies even when the policy doesn't change, or whether or not we should modernize into the 21st century and ensure that there is continuous notification on a website and that a paper notification only goes out upon a change, an actual change.  What the ranking member is doing with the motion to recommit is once again empowering the unconstitutional and unaccountable CFPB to engage in even more activities that harm consumers. It ought to be rejected, and we ought to ensure that we adopt H.2396 and simplify and modernize one regulation that is harming consumers and harming financial institutions.

Tonight, we are not here to rehash the failings of the JCPOA, but we are really here to honor Secretary Kerry's commitment of oversight of Iran outside that agreement. He made it quite clear to Congress in his briefings that we would monitor the world's largest exporter of terror around the world; that we would do everything outside the agreement to enforce sanctions; that we would not stop reviewing their behavior.  This piece of legislation comes at an important time, as the Trump administration is taking significant steps to protect our homeland by reviewing actions around rogue regimes and sponsors of terror around the world, including  Now, my friend from Washington brought up the subject of the American worker, and, of course, we all are blessed by the brilliance and success of We couldn't come to our jobs without them.  But there are 5,000 airlines in the world, Mr.There are 10,000 Boeing aircraft in service, and there are 5,700 airplanes on order from the Boeing corporation to help make up that $41 billion of annual revenue.  The question here is not about selling airplanes, the question here is about protecting the homeland and interests of our country around the world.  Unfortunately, civil aviation is commingled with military Quds Force action; not just in what has been said tonight about transporting military action to Syria, supporting a war that has killed some 500,000 people, but what about Boeing transport from Damascus to Caracas?                              {time}  1815  What about the Boeing aircraft operated by the Iranian regime back and forth between Russia and Iran, back and forth between Tehran and Damascus, between Damascus and Venezuela?  It is not just the civilian aircraft, Mr.Speaker, and that is why we want to be alert, and our American citizens need to know if their bank deposits are being used to extend credit to a regime that seeks pleasure in murdering innocent people, murdering our men and women in uniform and even innocent civilians in their own country.  We may differ on our views on the JCPOA, but we can all agree that nothing in the nuclear deal prevents the sharing of information between an administration and this Congress about financing aircraft for the world's largest state supporter of terrorism. That is what this piece of legislation is trying to achieve. That is what Mr.Williams' point is in bringing it to the floor, and I appreciate his thoughtful work to implement this much-needed policy and to help keep the citizens in my district safe from Iran's global terror advance.

389,topic-id,759,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, I respectfully disagree with the chairman of the Financial Services This is not simply the gathering of information. This is not simply oversight.  Under H.4324, a condition would be imposed on the sale of commercial aircraft to The Iran nuclear deal was very clear. It is broadly committed to ``allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services to Iran.'' The only condition on the U.commitment is that ``licensed items and services be used exclusively for commercial passenger aviation.''  H.4324 would impose a new condition, a new condition which would require certification by the Secretary of State and all of the process that would ensue.  It is not a stretch--in fact, it is fairly clear--that if H.4324 were to pass, the Iranians and others could credibly claim that we have violated our obligations under the Now, nobody should be surprised by that.  Despite the advice of his National Security Advisor, despite the advice of the Secretary of Defense, despite the advice of pretty much everyone around him, President Trump chose not to recertify Iranian compliance with the Iran nuclear deal.  We have seen bill after bill, including the bill just voted on, attempting to reverse the Iran nuclear deal, and we have heard this since this deal first came to the floor.  Let's reflect for one second on what the implications are:  This bill puts the Iran nuclear deal at risk. It arguably takes American aircraft manufacturers out of competition for lucrative contracts. My colleague from Washington will address this shortly.[[Page H9883]]  I don't understand how putting American jobs at risk and taking American manufacturers out of contention in favor of companies like Airbus is about keeping America great again. I don't understand why, when we focus on jobs, this should be an action we should take.  However, I will say something, and I speak as a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Prior to the passage of the Iran nuclear deal, it is not an exaggeration to say I didn't worry every night in a way that we worry today about North I went to bed every night thinking about Iranian centrifuges spinning, about military technology being created that could ultimately deliver a nuclear weapon to Israel or to Europe or to the United States, and our intelligence community believed that we were 2 to 3 months away from an Iranian nuclear weapon, kind of where we are today on North  I suspect everybody in this Chamber doesn't want to be where we are on North Korea with another state, with  I understand the skepticism on Iran, and I agree with everything that the chairman said with respect to Iran being a state sponsor of terrorism, with Iran being a location of money laundering, and I could go on, with Iran being an absolutely appalling regime.  But I speak as a member of the Intelligence Committee for a lot of people in this room when I say that, for the first time in a long time subsequent to the passage of the Iran deal, whatever you think of Iran--and not many of us think much of Iran--we don't go to bed every single night worrying about the possibility of waking up to a nuclear-weaponized  Why would we put that at risk?  I agree with the chairman that transparency is important, and I agree with everybody that Iran needs to be watched very, very skeptically. But why would we want to be with Iran exactly where we are today with North Korea?  Is this effort, which, in my opinion, is simply a continuation of the efforts to end the Iran deal, to reverse President Obama's legacy, is it worth going to bed at night not just worried about North Korea, but worried about Iran? I would suggest that it is not.  I don't want to go back to the pre-Iran deal era when I became an expert on centrifuges, on Uranium-235, on hardened bunkers and the weaponry that we produced to penetrate hardened bunkers and to the realization that, if we had to go to war against Iran to prevent a nuclear Iran, the consequences would be as awful as if we went to war with North Korea to prevent a North Korea nuclear-weaponized state.

868,topic-id,1180,"Mr.President, I want to thank Senator Durbin for organizing this time and for his leadership and advocacy on behalf of Dreamers across the country.  Passing the Dream Act is about more than the law. It is about compassion and basic human decency. There is nothing compassionate or decent about revoking the status that 800,000 young people, including 600 in Hawaii, depend on to live, work, and study in the only country they have ever known.  Relying on a promise from the Federal Government, these young men and women came out of the shadows, handed over personal information, and underwent extensive background investigations to earn their DACA status, but the President's actions have put them all at risk. Like so many people, I have been moved by stories of how DACA has transformed the lives of Dreamers across the country.  Earlier today, I spoke with two young Dreamers who flagged me down in the hallway as I was going from one hearing to another, and they asked to speak with me. One had traveled from Arizona and is only a high school student. He was all dressed up, and he had a bowtie on. The other who flagged me down in another part of the building lives in California and is originally from South Both asked me to continue to fight to pass the Dream Act before the end of this year.  To see these young people politely approaching Members of Congress like me--I don't think a lot of them even had appointments, but they had to study the faces of the Members of Congress so, as they saw us in the hallway, they could come up to us. So the fact that they politely asked to speak with me, even as they literally are fighting for their lives, speaks volumes. We should open our hearts to them and support their cause.  Like so many of my colleagues, I have met with Dreamers from my home State of Hawaii to hear about how DACA has changed and enriched[[Page S7969]]their lives. In October, I met with three young women studying at the University of Hawaii thanks to  Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice were, in many ways, like any other college student. They balance busy class schedules with part-time jobs and extracurricular activities. They have also lived in fear since the President and his Attorney General made the cruel and arbitrary decision to end DACA on September 5. Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice told me they hadn't received any notice about what would happen after the program ended on March 5, 2018, and depended on media updates that would literally determine their futures. They shared hopes and concerns most of us would take for granted.  When their newly issued driver's licenses expire, they may not be able to fly home to California to visit their families because they will no longer have valid After turning their information over to the Federal Government, they worry for their parents and families, many of whom are undocumented. When their work authorizations expire, they will have to drop out of college because they can't afford tuition.  Karen is pursuing her master's degree in conservation biology and environmental science and hopes to have a career in research. She said:       If I lose my DACA, that means I'd lose my work permit which      means I lose my graduate assistantship which means I can't      [graduate]. So thinking about those logistics is definitely      scary. Because I wouldn't be able to complete my education      unless I found another way to fund it.       [Dreamers] are working to improve our lives, and the lives      of our families, and hopefully, through our professions, your      life too. We're becoming doctors and lawyers and teachers and      any field you can imagine there's probably at least one of us      represented. So give us a chance.  Even with all they have been through, Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice told me they don't regret signing up for DACA because, although their futures are now in jeopardy, for a few years they were given a chance at their American dream.  Dreamers like Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice are not asking for much. They are just asking us, as Karen said, ``for a chance.'' They are asking us to keep the promise we made to them, and it is in our power to do that.  Around 10,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status since Attorney General Sessions announced the program's end. Every day Congress doesn't act, 122 Dreamers lose their DACA status. We are taking away these young people's chances of staying in school, pursuing meaningful careers, and even visiting their families at  While the President once called Dreamers ``absolutely incredible kids'' and made promise after promise to protect them, he has gone back on his word time and again. We can't rely on his empty promises.  I ask my colleagues to put yourselves in the shoes of these What if your future in this country was uncertain after March 5? What if you were facing deportation to a country you don't even know so you have to start life all over again? What if your families lived in daily fear? If we can put ourselves in the shoes of Dreamers, what part of the Dreamers' uncertainty and living in fear can we not understand?  Is it because we are not them? Is it that we can only relate to someone's existence or experience only if we lived it ourselves? If that is the only way we can relate to people's problems--people who come to us for help--then we are in a very sorry state.  Most of us who serve in the Senate are only one or two generations removed from immigrant status or immigrant backgrounds. I, myself, am an immigrant. I was not born in this country. I came here with a single mother. I know what it is like to come to a new country where you don't speak the language and where you have to learn, where you have to adjust. All my mother asked for was a chance to attain the American dream.  It really bothers me that at the time when we were talking about passing comprehensive immigration reform, Member after Member came to the floor of the Senate and talked about their immigrant backgrounds. Yet too many of them were perfectly happy to shut the door on immigrants in this country--over 11 million undocumented persons--to shut the door in their faces; forgetting that most of us come from immigrant backgrounds; forgetting that this country, apart from the original people who were here, American Indians, we are all immigrants.  So let's put ourselves in the shoes of our Let's open our hearts to them. These are young people who just want to have a chance at the American dream that too many of us take for granted now. Let's not only be able to empathize with people whose experiences we have lived. Let's not be there, let's not go there.  I call on my colleagues to support the Dream Act now.  I yield the floor.

727,topic-id,2116,"Mr.President, I come to the Senate floor to once again talk about the need to pass tax reform for hard-working The House has passed a bill, the Senate has passed a bill, and now, of course, we are working through the conference committee to get the very best product we can for the American people.  This tax relief is not just about reducing the tax burden on hard-working Americans and making sure they can keep more of their hard-earned dollars after tax, but it is also very much about economic growth. The tax relief package we are putting together that is coming together through the conference efforts, working to improve on both the House version and the Senate version, is designed to grow our economy. That is incredibly important because over the last decade, what we have seen are stagnant wages and income. So workers are working as hard as ever--harder than ever--but they are not seeing that growth in their paycheck. That is why we have to make this tax relief package pro-growth, so at the end of the day, that worker has a lower tax burden, but they also have a rising wage and more income. It is the combination of those two things that really--it is the rising tide that lifts all boats, if you will. That is how we generate that higher standard of living for workers and taxpayers across this great  So that is what we are working to do: tax relief, grow the economy, create more jobs--and create them here at home versus overseas--and higher wages and income.  These are just some of the statistics from the tax relief package that we put together. These are provided by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation as well as the White House Council of Economic The objective is to grow wages by $4,000 over the 10-year scoring period, making sure our workers are seeing real wages. The estimate right now is that this tax bill is pro-growth and will generate, on average, $4,000 in higher wages, combined with an average tax cut of about $2,200. That is an average family--a family of four with median income.  It will generate almost 1 million new jobs, and that is what, of course, pushes wages higher. When you create more jobs, it is that demand for labor that pushes wages higher. That is how it works. We are talking about almost 1 million new jobs over the 10-year period and a 3.7-percent larger economy. So growing the economy, creating more jobs, and it is that demand for labor on the part of business that pushes wages and income higher.  When we look at the next chart I have, we see that we provide tax relief across all incomes. So it is really focused on lower income, middle class, making sure that, like I said, wage earners are saving more of their hard-earned dollars, but the effort is to cut taxes across all income groups, and that is what we do. It starts by taking the seven brackets we have and reducing them. It is just kind of simple math.  The House plan reduces the number of brackets to only three. We keep the seven different brackets. The reason for that is because the objective is to lower everyone's tax rate, and we are better able to do that by keeping the seven tax rates.  Some might say: You want to do simplification. We do want to do simplification, and we do tax simplification. There is no question that we do tax simplification because the complexity in calculating your taxes is calculating your taxable income, your adjusted gross income subject to taxes. That is the complicated part. Whether we have three different rates to apply to it or seven different rates to apply, depending on which bracket you fall into, that really doesn't add complexity.  So we keep the simplification intact while we make sure that we provide tax relief across all of the different tax brackets or tax rates. That is what we see in this second chart.  In addition, we keep or expand many of the tax deductions or tax provisions that are important to families, and that starts with the child tax. Well, I should say it actually starts with the standard deduction. We double, in essence, the standard deduction. For an individual, right now it is a little over $6,000 a person. We double that standard deduction to $12,000. For a married couple, you are talking over $24,000 that is covered under the standard deduction, no tax.  In addition, if you are an individual and you have dependents, either children or maybe taking care of a parent or something like that, you get $18,000 in that standard deduction. Why is that important? Because by doubling that standard deduction, we go from 7 out of 10 filers not itemizing to something like 9 out of 10 tax filers not itemizing. This means real simplification. It means doing your tax return on maybe just a one-page form. This means you are not only reducing rates but also greatly simplifying the Tax  We keep other provisions that are very important for American families and, in fact, enhance them. For example, the child tax credit is doubled. So not only do we double the standard deduction, but we also double the child tax credit. We go from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. This is going to make a huge difference for families.  Also, for family businesses, family farms, and small business we double the estate tax, the death tax unified credit, and include the step-up in basis. It is hugely important to make sure you can transition a small business, farm, or ranch from one generation to the next.  To save for college, we enable the 521 savings accounts to continue for parents. Another very important one is we encourage businesses to provide paid family and medical leave by giving them a tax credit to partially offset an employee's pay while caring for a child or family member.  Other things we keep, in terms of deductions that are very important, again, to hard-working families are as follows:  The mortgage interest deduction. We make sure they can continue to deduct the interest on their home mortgage.  The deduction of charitable contributions. It is obviously very important for the greater good of our society that people can continue to contribute to charities they believe in and support and that they can deduct those charitable contributions.  The child and dependent care tax credits, the adoption tax credit, and the earned-income tax credit. We make sure people can continue to contribute to their 401(k) accounts on a basis that is tax-advantaged.  Then, medical expense deductions. Obviously, for our seniors, this is very important. For somebody who has a medical condition or an illness, being able to deduct those medical expenses is extremely important.  This is about making sure hard-working Americans can have not only tax relief but also the pro-growth aspect they see in the rising wages of incomes.  That is what I want to talk about in this third chart, which goes to supporting our businesses across this great country. Small business is the backbone of our economy. Small businesses, farms, and ranches are the absolute backbone of our economy. Small businesses typically are passthrough businesses, which means the income flows[[Page S8000]]through the business and is then taxed at the individual level. So part of the tax relief we are providing to small businesses comes from the reduction in the individual rates, as I have already gone through, because that income has flowed through.  Passthroughs can be a partnership, a sub-S corporation, a limited liability partnership, a limited liability corporation. These are all passthroughs. So when the income flows through that small business to the individual, because we have lowered the rates, that already provides a lower net tax on those small businesses and the people who own and work and invest in those small businesses.  The other thing we do is provide a 20-percent distribution deduction--a reduction in the taxable amount as far as income distributed by those businesses. We have gone through various iterations. We started at about 17 percent. We had hoped to move it higher. I think we will end up around 20 percent. What this means is, when income flows through that passthrough business, 20 percent is deducted before you calculate the income. For example, if you flow through $1,000, you would be taxed on the $800. Now, apply those lower tax rates I talked about, and you can see clearly that you significantly reduce that tax rate on these small businesses.  Why is that so important? It enables small businesses to keep more of their hard-earned dollars, to invest in equipment, to expand and grow their business. It enables them to hire more people, like perhaps these great young people we have here working as pages. It enables them to raise wages and income and to grow their business, or, for an entrepreneur, to maybe start up a business.  So it is those dollars that instead of going to taxes, stay with the business. They are invested in the businesses, create more jobs, more opportunity, and higher wages. That is the pro-growth aspect of this tax relief I mentioned at the outset.  The other way this tax is really pro-growth is also for larger C-corps bringing down that rate. Of course, smaller businesses use the C-corp as well, but by bringing down that rate, we make companies in America more competitive in the global economy. Companies that do business not only here in America but in other countries around the world have to decide where they are going to invest. Are they going to invest and grow their plant and operations here in America or are they going to grow their plant and operations somewhere else? Of course, if they grow here, they are hiring people here. They are paying wages and salaries here in America rather than in some other country. We want companies that do business internationally or globally growing their operations here, not overseas.  Right now, economists estimate that, currently, in excess of $2.5 trillion is held overseas by these companies and is not brought back to the United States and invested here because we have one of the highest tax rates in the world. Our corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the world.  So when we talk about the current 35-percent tax rate, companies look at that and say: Why would we bring back earnings from another country, say, Ireland--pick a country anywhere in the world. Why would we bring those earnings back and pay a really high tax, versus reinvesting overseas or somewhere else where the tax is much lower, and we can be more competitive?  This is what we are having to deal with, and that is why we lower the corporate rate--because that then creates the incentive to come back, invest dollars in the United States, and create more jobs here in America, and, in so doing, as they bring that revenue back, which is called repatriation, they generate tax revenues which help us provide more tax relief for hard-working  So that is what I mean. That is the two-fer aspect of this tax relief plan. It is making sure individuals have real tax relief so they keep more of what they earned, but it is also about making sure they earn more, that their wages and income grow, and that there are more jobs and opportunities here in That is absolutely the focus of this tax relief plan and what we are working to achieve.  Both the House and Senate have passed versions of this tax bill. We are now working to get the very best product we can through the conference committee. We are making real progress, and we need to continue to work together and get this tax relief done. We have been working on it for a long time. A lot of effort has gone into it. It is time now to finish it up this week, to vote on it, and to get this tax relief passed before the end of the year so, as Americans go into 2018, they know they are able to keep more of their hard-earned tax dollars and we also have a vibrant economy, where there is going to be more jobs and opportunity and higher income and wages.

488,topic-id,1375,"I thank the gentleman for yielding and for taking this opportunity on the Special I think, as an aside, I need to apologize to him for making him wait so long for this Special  I also want to tell the American people, Mr.Speaker, that the gentleman who has taken this Special Order is probably the constitutional expert not only in this body, but one of the constitutional experts in our country. He is a great legislator himself. Although he is new to this body, he is not new to being a legislative leader at all. He has been a legislative leader in our State for many years. He is a wonderful teacher and somebody who has great political courage and is willing to stand and say that the emperor has no clothes. He is willing to call attention to the fact that our democracy is at risk, that our due process is at risk.  He used the phrase ``trumped up.'' What an interesting phrase that is that we have used for many years. I don't know that it has had as much relevance in years past as it now may have.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr.Raskin, for leading this Special Our system of government, as he has pointed out, is based on the rule of law. We are a government of laws, not of men.  What that means is that it is not personalities, not dictators, not kings that rule our land. It is the law, the law of our Constitution, the law of our legislators, and the common law that we pursue as interpreted by our court systems. Its foundation is the constitutional principle that all are equal under the law. No one is exempt.  The appointment of a special prosecutor earlier this year to look into the possibility of the administration or Trump campaign officials colluding with a foreign adversary or obstructing justice falls into a long tradition in our country of using independent counsel to investigate those in the most senior offices of our government.  Our Founding Fathers would say that is a check and balance; that is a protection against the usurpation of democracy.  The choice of former FBI Director Bob Mueller to be that independent investigator was an extraordinarily wise one; a decision greeted with support from across the political spectrum, precisely because Mr.Mueller is so widely respected for his independence and his commitment to the law above all else.  And, parenthetically, although it is not necessarily relevant, he is a He is not, however, driven by the politics of left or right or Republican or He is a man of the law, a man who seeks the truth, a man who has dedicated his career to assuring that we remain a land of liberty under law.  We have already seen a demonstration of that commitment in the prompt firing of a subordinate investigator for an act that was not illegal, as the gentleman from Maryland, our constitutional scholar, has pointed out, but, however, threatened to impugn the objectivity of the investigation.  In other words, he removed somebody who he thought might undermine the credibility of this investigation because he is so committed to this investigation being objective and unquestionably fair. Mr.Mueller has made it abundantly clear that he will not tolerate any hint of bias in this investigation.  So far, it appears that his investigation is bearing fruit, having uncovered serious crimes and secured three indictments as well as guilty pleas from two key subjects. Guilty pleas.  This was not a question of: We had a trial and somebody convinced 12 people that he was guilty.  This was a case where the individual said: ``I am guilty. I did what was alleged. I know that it is illegal, and I should bear the consequences.''  That included, of course, the National Security Advisor--who was National Security Advisor, I think, for 25 days, or close to that number--Mr. As the investigation has advanced, Mr.Speaker, we have seen troubling statements from the President and his advisers seeking to sow uncertainty about the legitimacy of the special counsel's activities and undermine confidence in him.  But it is not so much the confidence in him that is critical. It is confidence in the law. It is confidence in the process. It is confidence that, in fact, we are a nation of laws, and whether we are President or peasant, we will be held accountable if, in fact, we break the laws.  What is being done to undermine this process threatens the independence of the investigation and those who are undertaking it. It is dangerous to our democracy and to our freedom.  Now, in recent days, we have heard calls by the President and his allies to launch a counterinvestigation of the special prosecutor's investigation. Those of us who know history know that that is so often the defense of those who seek authoritarian power, of those who believe they are above the law, of those who believe they can intimidate others so that they will never be held accountable for wrongdoing.  This preposterous suggestion has but one purpose: to cast a shadow of doubt over the findings of Mr.Mueller's inquiry by attempting to frame it in a partisan way.  In fact, Mr.Mueller was appointed by a Republican-appointed Deputy Attorney It is tactics like this one that we see so often overseas in countries ruled by dictators and those seeking to become dictators. This willful effort to erode confidence in any institution that must be seen as impartial is harmful because if nobody and nothing is impartial, if everyone and everything is tainted by politics and interest, then no one can possess the moral authority to hold accountable one who wishes to be entirely unaccountable.  That, Mr.Speaker, is the reason I think that the President has also attacked the fourth estate, the newspapers, the broadcasters, the people whose duty it is to bring facts to the people so that they, the people, can make a rational judgment in a democracy, for it is in their hands that the power ultimately resides; and if you undermine those who give them the facts, then you undermine their ability to make decisions.  This ultimately is what the special prosecutor's work is all about: accountability, ensuring that every person is held to the same high standard of behavior under the laws of our  So, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both parties--this is not about party. This is about country. This is about patriotism. This is about the rule of law. If we lose that respect[[Page H9933]]for law, we will lose our country. It will be a different, lesser country.  I urge my colleagues, from both parties, from every ideological corner, let us not forget the most fundamental principle that binds us together as Americans and as public servants: That all are created equal; that all of us, all Americans, are equal under the law.  That doesn't mean we are the same, but it means, in the eyes of the law, we are equal as we stand to be held accountable, or to be held innocent, or not involved, or not owing somebody else for wrongdoing. We need to uphold it by our words and by our deeds.  The special prosecutor's work must continue unimpeded, and it must continue to be respected. Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee, that was not the case. To defend the indefensible undermines respect for law.  I want to thank my friend again, Mr.Jamie Raskin, from Montgomery County, Maryland, for this Special As I said, he is a great constitutional scholar and teacher, a great legislator. More importantly than that, he is an individual who loves his country and, throughout his life, has fought to make the country all that the Founding Fathers meant it to be.  I thank him for coming to this floor and for his efforts to ensure that Mr.Mueller's investigation can continue to be seen as impartial and with its objective unquestioned, and that is accountability, accountability and justice, and equal justice under the law. That is our bedrock. That is our touchstone. That is our guiding star. That is what Professor Raskin, Congressman Raskin, Citizen Raskin is talking about today, and we all ought to thank him for that.

First of all, Mr.Speaker, I want to say that the majority leader and I, as well as his predecessor, Mr.Cantor, have worked together on what we call a Hackathon, which is a meeting annually of individuals involved in the high-tech community in how better to communicate, how better to process information, how better to make transparent the work of this body and make the actions of this body accessible to the general public as they happen.

598,topic-id,3482,"Mr.Speaker, I would simply observe that what the majority leader did not mention--again, I have not seen the conference report, so this is not based upon a review of the conference report, but this is based upon the Senate bill and the House bills that were passed by both bodies--was that it will increase the debt of our country by some $1.5 trillion and a minimum of $1 trillion. It will raise taxes on some 78 million Americans between $50,000 of income and $150,000 of income.  I am assuming that the elimination of the mandate is still in the conference report. I am not sure, but the information I have is that it is still in the report. Mr.Speaker, that will cost 13 million people to be uninsured as a result.  I have information, Mr.Speaker, that what the conference report does is reduce taxes on some of the wealthiest people in I am not sure how they offset that--maybe with a mandate, maybe with something else--but 62 percent of the bill's resources go to the top 1 percent in  Mr.Speaker, Speaker Ryan spoke on this floor about the average family making $59,000 a year. He mentioned that that family will get, under the House bill--again, I haven't seen the conference report--$1,182 per year in a tax cut.  What the Speaker did not mention is that the family in the top 1 percent will get a tax cut of $1,198 per week. Per week, Mr.In other words, 52 times what the struggling American will get, what the American who Speaker Ryan said may not be able to come up with $500 if they have a crisis with a refrigerator or their heating unit, something of that nature, or their car breaks down will get.  Mr.Speaker, we on this side of the aisle do not believe that this bill addresses relief for the struggling working men and women of this country.  Mr.Speaker, it is clear, in all of the polling, that the average working American shares that view. They believe correctly that this is a tax cut for the rich and a few sprinkles to the middle class. I am sure the leader will have something to say on that.  In addition, Mr.Speaker, it is ironic that what will happen in this tax bill is we will phase out. We will--again, I have not seen the conference report, so I don't know exactly whether that is true or not, but in both the House and Senate bills, we phased out--we didn't phase out, we proposed to be phased out. The benefits to those middle-income, hardworking Americans will see their benefits phased out. That will not be true of corporations. It will not be true of the wealthiest in our country.  So it is troubling, Mr.Speaker, that a bill of this magnitude is being rushed to judgment. In 1986, the gentleman, in making his announcement, said we have been working on this for 31 years. Now, I presume he was talking about from 1986 to 2017.  What he did not say, Mr.Speaker, is, in 1986, we had 30 days of public hearings on a bill. Thirty days of public hearings. What he did not say is that we had 450 witnesses during those public hearings testifying about the taxes. What he did not say is that there were nearly 4 months of hearings on the 1986 reform bill. And what he did not say is that the Ways and Means Committee conducted 26 days of markup.  This bill has received less than 7 days of markup in both bodies and in the conference. This is being rushed to judgment. The American people, by substantial numbers, believe this bill is not good for them.  Now, Mr.Collins said that he talked to a donor and the donor said: Don't call me again if you don't pass this tax bill.  I get that. I don't know who the donor was and I don't know how rich the donor was, but obviously the donor thought that he had a real stake or she had a real stake in this tax bill.  We regret that we are not doing as we did in 1986, because what the majority leader did not mention either was that the 1986 bill was a bipartisan bill with President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill supporting it, and with Chairman Rostenkowski, a Democratic chair of the House Ways and Means Committee; and a Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood from Oregon, supporting the bill. It was a bipartisan bill. And what the majority leader did not mention is the 1986 bill did not add a single cent to the deficit. It was paid for.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is a much lesser product than it could have been. We on this side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, think we need tax reform. We are prepared to support tax reform. We believe we need to bring down the corporate rate. We believe we need to make sure that small businesses can prosper and grow into large businesses.  What we don't believe in, Mr.Speaker, is simply having a bill that advantages the best-off in our country and says that the advantages we give to the middle class will be phased out in a little bit, about 5 years.                              {time}  1145  So, Mr.Speaker, we will, according to the majority leader, consider this bill next week. It will not be bipartisan, and that is a shame. It will not be positive for the country because it will put us even more deeply into debt, and the people who pay that bill, ultimately, will be our children.  And on both sides of the aisle--we don't have a lot of Members on the floor, but I say to every Member on the floor, every Member on this floor, I am sure, at some point in time you have given a speech somewhere that said: ``We care about the debt. We are going to bring down the debt.'' This bill does not do it. This bill exacerbates the debt.  Anybody who believes that this bill is going to pay for itself through dynamic scoring and economic growth is kidding themselves. It is a rationalization to vote for a bill for which the main imperative is political, not policy, because my Republican colleagues, Mr.Speaker, believe that, if they don't pass this bill, they will lose the next election.  I have heard that argument over and over and over again. That is not a reason to vote for this bill. It is a reason[[Page H9920]]to say: Let's go back to the table. Let's include Mr.Neal in the consideration, the ranking member. Let's include Mr.Wyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Let's include Mr.McCarthy and me to try to see if we can reach a bipartisan, positive, constructive piece of legislation which will, like the 1986 legislation, enjoy the support of a wide range of the American people and their  Mr.Speaker, we had an election yesterday in Mr.Jones won that election. Mr.Strange, the incumbent Republican representing Alabama right now, lost the primary. He has no mandate.  Why rush this bill through? This bill, if it were passed on December 31 of next year, would affect the 2018 taxes that would be filed in April of 2019. The need to rush this bill, Mr.Speaker, seems to be that, and the reason for having no hearings, the reason for having no witnesses, is because this bill, on its merit, cannot sustain itself.  Now, let me read you a quote, Mr.Speaker: ``I think the message of the moment is that the American people, all across the country, are asking us, even in the most liberal State, Massachusetts, to stop this healthcare bill. I think that means there will be no more healthcare votes in the Senate prior to the swearing in of Scott Brown, whenever that may be.''  That statement was made on January 20, 2010, by the present majority leader who was then, of course, the minority leader. And his proposition was: You ought to wait until Scott Brown is here so that Massachusetts can have its vote counted. But hypocritically, he has changed his tune today when Alabama, a very conservative State, the opposite of Massachusetts, has voted to elect Doug Jones to the  I don't hear Mr.McConnell or anybody else saying: Let's wait for the duly elected Member of the United States Senate from Alabama to be seated so that he will have an opportunity to vote on this extraordinarily consequential vote and, in my opinion, negative consequences to our country.  Mr.Speaker, I am sure the majority leader might have some comments he wants to make in response, and, therefore, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  There were a lot of questions about the schedule. I took notes because there were a lot of things said, but let me first make sure I can try to get through all of them.  You first mentioned many times, what I did not mention. Now, I was asked a question, when would we vote on the tax bill, so I want to be very clear. I answered the question. I said, yes, we will vote on it You said you have heard that it could be Tuesday, so I just said yes, and I didn't mention others because I wasn't asked other questions. But now that you have, let's walk through this.  One of your first arguments was debt. Do you realize, in this progrowth, tax-cutting, job creation bill, if it just grows four-tenths of 1 percent, it pays for all of it?  But what is interesting here is--don't take my word for it--what happens every day to the market when they realize Congress and the Senate is 1 day closer to passing the tax bill? Everybody with a 401(k) gets a pay raise.  The market has set more than 59 records since the election and our movement to passing a tax bill, and that is for all Americans who invested. Everybody's retirement is getting a little better because of it.  Now, what about on the jobs perspective? Well, Broadcom, which was created in America but left America based upon the current Tax Code, on the day of the announcement of our tax bill, said: We are coming back. It is not just that we are bringing so many jobs back. We are going to spend $3 billion a year in R&We are going to spend $6 billion in manufacturing.  And that is $20 billion a year in revenue for that company that is going to pay taxes now in  But I wonder, that is a big company. Do you know what I just read the other day? A company announcing they are going to Syracuse, New York, based upon our tax bill.  Yes, things are changing in People are excited about it.  But it is not just those that are going to hire these thousands of Americans to work. I want to make sure it happens in Maryland as well, so I wanted to look at your district, so here we go. My good friend represents Maryland's He has done it for quite some time. Here are a few facts.  Currently, you have 47 percent of filers in Maryland Five that take the standard deduction, so they will be better off because they will get a doubling the day the President signs it.  Another 11 percent have itemized deductions that are less than our new higher standard deduction, so they, too, will save. Not only are they going to save money, they are going to save time. Instead of spending weeks trying to fill out a tax form, it is going to be done in minutes. And you know when they fill out their tax form, they are going to get money.  But they don't have to wait until April 15. Not only in your district, but across this country, check your check come February, because you know what is going to be in that check? More money because the standard deduction goes up.  So that is 58 percent of my friend's district is better off on day one. But from what you tell me, you don't think that is good enough to vote for. A majority of your district is better off on day one. That is not even talking about the small businesses.  Do you know, the small businesses in your district, those that are earning $400,000, they are going to save $19,000. I know we are dear friends, but I am not sure if I have ever known that you have owned a business.  You know my background. When I was 20, I started my first business. There were three lessons I learned that have never left me: I was the first one to work; I was the last one to leave; and I was the last one to be paid.  This is going to create more entrepreneurship, more opportunity, and more people are going to be hired.  Now, I know you are worried about the debt, but it just strikes me, this year, you voted for a budget just a couple of months ago--I am not going to go back to another Congress--that increased the deficit by $6.8 trillion. So we are only worried about the debt at certain times?  Well, this bill is actually going to grow the economy, as we have watched quarter after quarter after quarter of the administration.  Now, I have got to make sure I got all of it.  You talked about hearings. We have had 59 public hearings. We printed out, before we even ran to continue the majority, about what we would do on tax.  But let's get to the core. That was your district. Let's say to all Americans, it doesn't matter where you live. So anybody, it doesn't matter if you sit on that side of the aisle, on this side of the aisle. It doesn't matter if you are Democrat, Republican, or you are a It doesn't matter what you are. You are an American first.  And you know what your constituents are going to see? Let's take the average family, the average family of four, making $55,000. You can write this down. You know how much tax they are going to pay? But that still is not good enough for you.  It is very interesting, in my social science studies, what the party on the other side of the aisle used to say they were for. I believe, back in the day, if you would have stood up here and said, ``I have got a tax bill that is going to make sure the average family of four, on the first $55,000, is going to pay zero,'' they not only would be excited, they would vote for it.  And you talk to me about bipartisanship. I really think that is a question for you, bipartisanship.  Is it bipartisanship when we reach out to you about CHIP, about healthcare for children, a place not to play politics?  We even stopped a hearing and a markup that we had scheduled well in the future because you came to us, your side of the aisle, and asked us to because you thought you could come to an agreement. Then we were told by your leadership, no, nobody could vote for it. We put things in the bill that we thought you would even want, but, no, you still voted ``no.''  And how many times have you told me on this floor, I think it was just a few months ago--and I will quote you, if I may--about government funding, because I was concerned because I had read some articles in The New York[[Page H9921]]Times that suggested, ``as a minority party struggling to show resistance in an era of President Trump, the Democrats are now ready to let the lights of government go dark.'' I read that to you because I wanted to know was that true or was that false.  Well, you said to me, when I asked my friend whether that rumor was true, he replied: ``. . . nobody on my side is talking about wanting to shut down the government. We don't want to shut down the government'' was your quote.  You continued to say: ``I would assure my friend that it is neither our intent nor our desire. As a matter of fact, we want to work quickly to avoid that happening. That is not good for, obviously, the American people; it is not good for managers trying to plan on how to deliver services; and it is certainly not good for our Federal employees. So I would want to work with you to make sure that doesn't happen.''  Mr.Speaker, that was in March, just 9 months ago. I wonder what changed in those 9 months because just last week--and I tell my friend, there was no partisanship in putting a continuing resolution on the floor for 2 weeks. There was no poison pill on this side of the aisle. It was a clean one. And I watched, sitting at this desk, how the vote was going, and I watched the other side, Mr.I watched people, not that they just voted ``no.'' They were whipped into the position to vote ``no.'' I watched the tally. And once that tally got past the magic number of 218, I watched my good friend put his thumb up, because he gave the okay to those 14 Democrats in his conference that were sitting there, that were told not to vote until it passed. I just wonder what happened to bipartisanship on something that is so bipartisan.  I know the thousands of Federal employees you have in your district, but that is just--I listened, Mr.Speaker, to the leader of the Democratic Party on the other side who said, just 2 days prior, the only person talking about the shutdown is President Well, the only person taking action and whipping to get to a shutdown was on this floor.  We have had open hearings, Republican and We have had an open, bipartisan, bicameral conference. They have walked through an entire bill. We have made sure Americans are going to get a tax cut and jobs are going to be created. It is already happening before the bill is even signed.  I am not sure if I didn't mention something else, because you try to correct if something was not mentioned. But I want to make sure I answered all those questions for you because I know, not just in your district, that every family of four making $55,000 will pay nothing, that all the small businesses that are going to hire new people--and I differ from you.  Maybe you will whip strongly against it like you whipped strongly against the CR and keeping government open, But I still think, when I look upon that tally on the tax bill, I think there will be some on your side. And why do I think that? Because they told me so.                              {time}  1200  But I still think, when I look upon that tally on the tax bill, I think there will be some on your side. And why do I think that? Because they told me so.  The only difference will be, at the end of the day, if they don't, if you keep the strong arm, and instead of releasing the thumb up once it passes and put it down, that is the only reason we won't have bipartisanship on the floor that day.  But I believe in I believe in this floor, and I believe in the individuals who fight so strongly to get here to represent their constituents; that they know the new jobs in their district, they know how much those families will save, and they will not let politics get the best of them. They will go against the tide to stop it. They believe that it will even be better. I look forward to that day.  I also look forward to my friend coming back to the quote he told me 9 months ago, because you know what? It is close to We have military men and women defending us. The gentleman talked about that bill the President recently signed that, yes, he worked to strong-arm with me, that is going to make government more effective, efficient, and accountable. It also had a pay raise for our men and women. And when he voted ``no,'' he told them they weren't getting their raise. But worse, he went even further.  The gentleman questioned whether they could actually have the funds to continue the battle where they needed to be. We have been through shutdowns. We know nobody wins. I believe what he told me 9 months ago. I just want him to come back.  ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgH9918-6.txt,566,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,14.0,December
599,topic-id,2699,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He made a number of points.  First, generally, I have been here long enough to have heard the debate for the 1981 bill, the so-called supply side, Jack Vice President Bush referred to it as ``voodoo economics.'' And point of fact, as the gentleman knows, because I am sure he knows the record, we increased the debt under Ronald Reagan 189 percent. Larger than any other President with whom I have served over the last 37 years; 189 percent. Stockman said: We knew it wasn't going to balance the budget. We just said that for political purposes. Stockman said that. He was Director of the OMB under Ronald  Then in 2001 and 2003, we had tax cuts. We heard the same arguments, how it was going to grow robustly the economy. It brought in the deepest recession anybody in this Chamber, other than perhaps Sam Johnson, who I think is probably our oldest Member, because the rest of us didn't experience the depression, it ushered in not the biggest growth rate in America, but the least job-producing 8 years of any American President whom I have served with, and the deepest recession that anybody in this body has experienced, and a hemorrhaging of jobs.  In fact, the stock market, which the gentleman refers to, had a 25 percent decline in value over the 8 years of the Bush administration, with two tax cuts where exactly the same argument for growth was made, and it didn't happen.  On the other hand, I was here in 1993, when we raised taxes, not much, but a little bit, particularly for infrastructure, and the prediction, Mr.Leader, on your side of the aisle: we would tank as an economy; we would have a terrible recession.  Exactly the opposite happened. You were dead, not you personally, but those who made that representation were 180 degrees wrong.  First of all, we balanced the budget 4 years in a row. Nobody has done that other than President Now, you can say you were in charge of the Congress, you were, and I would respond to you: Why couldn't you do it under George Bush when you had everything? There is no answer to that.  In terms of the experience that we have had when we had tax cuts, the debt did, in fact, explode; 189 percent increase in the national debt. That was approximately 2\1/2\ times the increase under Obama and the increase under George But we continue to argue there is going to be great growth. No reputable economist agrees with that proposition. Well, you read them out to me. I will be glad to hear them.  The stock market increase under this President has gone up. It went up 300 percent under Barack Three hundred percent. Three hundred percent, from 6,500 to over 18,000.  He had the largest job production, and I told my friend, in 2016, as opposed to 2017, hear, my friends, there were 279,000 more jobs created in 2016, under Barack Obama, than have been created under this Mr.Speaker, 279,000 more. Now, that is not a great deal, but in terms of growth, there was more growth of jobs in 2016, when Obama was President of the United States, than has occurred under Donald Check the records. I am sure you will review and say: Let's see if Hoyer is just giving us some malarkey.  The gentleman talks about this great tax benefit. What he didn't mention, and what I was referring to, by the way, was when you were giving the schedule, not in response to the question, but that aside, doesn't mention the State and local taxes.  Now, I am not exactly sure what has happened to State and local taxes, but in my State, it will have a very substantial negative effect. Why? Because we have a significant income tax. Why? Because it is a progressive tax, and it puts the burden on those who have more.  Now, you may disagree with that. Just have a flat tax no matter what[[Page H9922]]you have, and you pay the same thing. I am not sure exactly what you have done.  The shutdown you talk about. You had 90 people vote against a CR that you recommended they vote for in September, which was a clean You would not have passed that You would have shut down government. You are responsible for keeping government open, ``you'' being your party. You are in the majority. The only reason that CR passed was because we voted for it. You had 90 of your people vote against it; 90, who apparently didn't want to pay the military, apparently didn't want to protect them overseas. That proposition, like they say, won't hunt, because the chairman of the Armed Services Committee voted against that Why? Because he thought it was harmful to the national security of our country. Secretary Mattis believes the CR is damaging.  It is inappropriate, in my view, when we do something and say: We don't like this bill, and the only party with whom I have served who would consciously, purposely shut down the government, I tell my friend, Mr.Speaker, is the Republican They did it in 1995, under Newt Gingrich, and they did it last year with Mr.Cruz coming over here and saying: Shut down the government unless they repeal the Shut it down, consciously.  We have never done that. Have we had to shut down because we couldn't get agreement? We have done that for a few days. But for 16 days you shut it down consciously. And guess what? When you voted to open up the government, guess who voted against it? Mr.Mulvaney, the Director of the He voted against opening up the government. I guess he was against the Armed I guess he was against defending our country, if that's your proposition.  You are right. You waited. We didn't get an agreement. But we waited long after September 30, when the gentleman says he is very concerned about funding it. The authorization expired. Now, you passed, ultimately, a bill that we didn't vote for. You passed it on your own. If you really were that concerned, you would have passed it before the authorization expired on September 30. We passed it some weeks later, and we passed it with a piece of funding in there that is going to undermine, for instance, just as one example, vaccinations for children, because you funded it, in part, by reducing substantially the Prevention Fund, which seeks to prevent illness.  On bipartisanship, very frankly, we had a 2-week CR, you are right, a 2-week You got a 2-week The only thing you have worked on, from our perspective, is the tax bill, and you did not include us in those discussions. You had closed hearings.  We had a conference hearing yesterday. Mr.Neal tried to move an amendment out of order. It wasn't accepted. It was a done deal. Done deal in secret.  I tell my friend, I reread a little bit of ``Young Guns'' last night. It talked about transparency. It talked about openness. It talked about doing things one at a time, not packaging a lot of bills.  The reason we all hate CRs is because nobody knows what is in a We lard it down, and this CR is larded down with numerous bills. We are talking about the tax bill, but the CR that the gentleman talked about is five or six major pieces of legislation put in one package. Take it or leave it.  That is not the way to run this organization, and that is what you guys said in ``Young Guns.'' And I agree with you, but it is not what you have done. It is what you said, but it is not what you have done.  Let me just close on this. Frankly, I was going to talk about the CR, but I am talking about it now.  We don't have a budget caps deal. Today is the 14th; so we are essentially 17 days from the end of the year. We don't have a caps deal. We don't have a disaster supplemental for Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands that is proposed to be in this CR, as I understand it, and the fires in The gentleman is absolutely correct, and we are going to support helping the folks of California who have been devastated by these fires. The gentleman is absolutely correct.  We don't have anything on We think that is critically important. I said to the majority leader 4 months ago that we felt this was critically important and we needed to get this done. I think, as I have said to the gentleman, we have over 300 votes on this floor for a bill to get this done.  Alexander-I don't think, I don't know, I haven't seen the conference report, but Alexander-Murray, which tries to stabilize the availability of healthcare at a reasonable price to the American people, I don't think that is in the tax bill, as I understand it.  VA Choice funding, I think, is in the I haven't seen exactly what it says.  Opioids funding. I have a crisis in my district. In every district in America, opioids is a critical issue. There is no funding in the CR, as I understand it, for that.  The fire grants program for our emergency responders, no money for that.  Perkins loans, nothing for that. The debt limit is going to come later.  National Flood Insurance Program, nothing for that, as I understand it.  Medicare and other health extenders, 702 of FISA to keep America secure and strong and safe. As I understand it, none of that is being dealt with.  The reason we voted against the last CR is because we are tired of kicking things down the road. We are tired of kicking the can down the road. We want to get to an agreement on a bipartisan basis to pass legislation that is positive for our country, and that is why we may vote against this next CR, because we ought to stop just kicking the can down the road. And we are going to kick the can, as I understand it, down the road to some point in time to January 19, is the discussion.  Mr.Leader, Mr.Speaker, we are prepared to sit down to try to reach agreement on these issues that have got to be reached. If we don't reach them, America will be less safe, less secure, less healthy as an economy and less healthy, literally, in terms of making sure that the healthcare available to America is on a stable path.  Mr.Speaker, I will yield to the majority leader and then make a few comments, and then we will close. I yield to my friend.                              {time}  1215  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I do look forward to these colloquies, and I first want to make sure history has it right. 137 economists sent a letter to Congress supporting our tax reform effort and saying it will accelerate growth. I don't know if the gentleman dislikes these 137, but these are economists. I don't judge the difference.  History says President Obama added more than $8 trillion to the national debt.  Now, how does that measure against all of the others?  Well, that is more than 43 prior Presidents combined. That is what history shows.  My friend is correct. He has been here much longer than I have. He actually had the majority for 40 years. He didn't balance the budget during that time. There was a common denominator that got the budget balanced in those 4 years, and that was the Republican majority who had to fight for it to get there.  The gentleman raised some other issues. He brought an issue up with a number of days. I don't think we should waste any time. He brought an issue up of we don't have a cap agreement to be able to work forward. It wasn't the gentleman, but it was his leader on the other side who decided not to go to the meeting at the White  The gentleman says that we should not waste our time on the floor. It wasn't this side, but we did have to take time up on this floor to make a motion to impeach the We took that time up on the floor. We didn't take the time up for CHIP and for the others.  I do remember the quote from my friend. We differ, sometimes philosophically, but we are friends and we are friends because I admire him. I admire principles. There are times when I have watched the gentleman stand for what he has said for years, and maybe his party has a different position. He doesn't hide from it. It is what he told the American public he would do, and he voted that way. And he will stand and oppose me because it is what he said in the past and what he said he would do.[[Page H9923]]  But this is not something new. He has always said: ``Funding our government is not a game. When one side wins and the other side loses, a shutdown is not a political football to be tossed around so casually.'' I was personally shocked last week.  I wondered what would have happened as I watched your operation whip people to a ``no;'' as we watched the time click; as you watched, you held those who stood by the voting booth who wanted to vote ``yes'' but could not.  Had we not gotten enough votes to keep government open, would your side of the aisle have applauded? Would your side of the aisle thought they won victory?  And you do go back and it is correct, there were 90 Members on this side of the aisle who didn't vote for a CR, but you, like myself, understand a CR is usually a responsibility of both because it is bipartisan. No one is getting anything, and no one wants to end in that position.  We don't want to be in a CR and we don't want to vote for a That is why we came to you so many times in the past when it came to But, yes, I understand sometimes people can use it for politics. Let's push it all to the end so maybe we get an advantage with something else.  We wanted an agreement. That is why staff of those four leaders have been meeting, and actually came to a pretty close agreement.  So what do they do next?  Take it to the next level. Let's go to the White House because the White House has been in those meetings at the same time because the President has to sign the bill, the Senate, the House, and leaders on both sides. But when that meeting came just a few short weeks ago, your leaders wouldn't show up. And I take you at your word that you are willing to sit down. The rest of your leadership has to be willing to sit down, too.  But this idea that we want to hold government hostage, so many times I have heard the gentleman in the past say that was wrong. He asked about the things that haven't been done.  The thing I love the most--I believe in metrics. They have to be honest metrics. I will share them with you because I share them with our side of the aisle because I want us to be judged. I want us to know exactly where we are. And if we are not where we said we are going to be, we should actually work harder.  So I took the first Congress of every new President since George H.I wanted to see how many bills came through committee. Because the gentleman is right. When he read the ``Young Guns'' book--and I am not saying to buy it in any shape or form because I don't want to cause any ethics issues, but I don't get any money from it anyway. I give it to the veterans.  ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgH9918-6.txt,566,CONVERSE VETERANS POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,14.0,December
600,topic-id,658,"Well, I keep pushing it for you.  Mr.I don't even know if it is in print. I want the bills to come through committee because that is where the expertise is; that is where the open public process is; that is where amendments get to be offered, won or lost. More bills in a first Congress since George H.Bush have gone through committee.  Now, let's measure how many bills have gotten off this floor.  Does the gentleman realize that more bills have been passed out of this Congress than any Congress in the first term of a President in modern history back to George H.Bush?  And we did it by going through a transparent, open process; exactly what we pledged we would do in that book. So, yes, I am glad you read it and I am glad you took the words, and I would love to show you the graphs.  But let's walk back to this: government funding is important. Let's talk about it. Here are the facts: By mid-July, all 12 appropriations bills passed both subcommittee and full committee. That was On July 27, we passed the four appropriations bills off the House floor, which provided for critical national security. Now, my friend and nearly all of the Democrats voted ``no.''  On September 14, we passed the remaining eight appropriations bills off this floor. Now, my friend and nearly all of the Democrats voted ``no.''  But the most disappointing vote, as I mentioned, was last week on December 7 to fund the government. My friend and the Democrats all voted ``no.''  When I was young and I didn't always get my way, I would go to my parents and I would complain. But it is really odd that we got to this floor in a different nature, that someone would complain about something not getting done and never vote for anything.  Mr.Speaker, I like my friend. I want my friend, who, for decades, has talked about not playing games with the funding of government. I don't know where you have gone, but I want you to come back. I think America needs you back. I think that leadership will be important for both sides. And I will tell you, I would have been disappointed in you if I watched you applaud if you were successful in shutting down the government. Because I know that is not the man you are. I know that is not the person and the principles of what you stand for.  All of those votes that you said this side of the aisle didn't vote for, I stood and voted for those because leadership is different. We do take votes that are tougher than others. We do have to put politics aside, and we do have to look out for the best of this country. It may not be the mood of the politics on TV that maybe wants to fight more, or throw another motion on the floor to impeach, but there is a time that we should rise above.  I think going into the end of this year, we should think anew and act anew. I think America should not see a bad Christmas because one side of the aisle wanted to shut it down, and not for any other reason than they voted ``no'' on all of the bills that would have kept it open. If you had a cause, if you had a desire, and if you had a big desire, you would have shown up to the meeting to actually get the answer.  We could have a cap agreement. We could be done with it. We could make sure our men and women get the raises they deserve. We could make sure that those in battle theater have every opportunity so they are able to carry out their mission that we asked them to do in the safest manner possible. That is what I want to see.

By the way, Mr.Speaker, it was the least regular order prior to an omnibus at the end of a year in dealing with appropriations bills that I have ever seen. They packaged, I think it was four or five the first time--four, I think, and then the balance of eight.  We didn't consider them individually.

And think about what we have learned in the last several weeks:  First, we learned that the DNC and the Clinton campaign paid for the dossier.

They first paid their law firm, who then paid Fusion GPS, who then paid Christopher Steele, who then paid This is a great irony.  We have Special Counsel Mueller investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 Presidential election, yet we know, just as sure as I am standing on the House floor tonight, the Clinton campaign paid Russians to do what? Influence the 2016 Presidential election.  They paid for the dossier. It has been reported--and I think it happened--but it has been reported the dossier became the basis to secure warrants at the FISA court. In other words, they took this dossier, this disproven dossier, fake news, National Enquirer, garbage dossier, they dressed it all up, they spruced it all up, they took it to the FISA court and then got a judge to say: Okay, that is enough to spy on  That is what has been reported.

So they used this dossier, this disproven dossier, to spy on  And then what have we learned in just the past 5 days?                              {time}  1745  Bruce Ohr, the Associate Deputy Attorney General; Bruce Ohr, four doors down from Mr.Rosenstein; Bruce Ohr, the top guy at the Justice Department, in 2016, during the campaign, is meeting with the guy who wrote the dossier, meeting with Christopher  Bruce Ohr, the top guy at the Justice Department, the Associate Deputy Attorney General, and four doors down from Mr.Rosenstein is also meeting with Glenn Simpson, the guy who founded Fusion GPS, the people who paid for the dossier.  So you have got Bruce Ohr, the top official at the Justice Department, hanging out with the guy who wrote and the guy who paid for the dossier during the campaign.  Here is the kicker. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Here is the kicker. At the same time that Bruce Ohr is meeting with him, we learn that Bruce Ohr's wife is being paid by Fusion GPS, working for the people who paid Christopher Steele to write the dossier that we believe was taken to the FISA court to secure warrants to spy on Americans associated with the Trump campaign.

556,topic-id,982,"Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee for this very important Special Order and for her incredible work in assuring justice in our country on so many, many fronts.  Madam Speaker, I rise tonight because of deep concern regarding our Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who are attempting to kick the legs out from under Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in our elections last year.  Yes, they called Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify on whether bias has tainted that investigation.  You know what is interesting about this?  All of the intelligence agencies of our country agree that there was more than meddling in last year's elections.  I actually pray for Robert Mueller every night because what the involvement of Russia in our elections has meant, you know, that's not a country that really welcomes debate and open conversation. They kill their enemies.  Robert Mueller is going to get at the very core of what Russia is doing not just in our country, but what it will instruct us Russia is doing in Europe and many other places around the world.  I listened to some of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee today, and I just want to put this on the record: Robert Mueller has given his life to this country through his entire years of service.  I have never personally sat to dinner with this man or I don't think I have even shaken his hand, but I admire him for his true patriotism.  I watched some of the individuals on the Judiciary Committee today and wondered if they knew that he had been in the Marine Corps during He actually rose to the level of captain. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with the Combat V for victory. He is the recipient of the Purple He was a Navy and Marine Corps captain and got the Commendation Medal for his valor in combat.  How many of those individuals questioning his integrity can even compare to that with their little fingernail?  Combat Action Ribbon, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry That was his early career.  As an attorney, he went into service to our country as an assistant U.district attorney on one coast, and then on the other coast as U.district attorney.  He is very evenhanded, and he worked his way up then in the Justice Department, rising to the level of Deputy Attorney He had been an Assistant Attorney His entire life has been spent in dangerous jobs.  To take on Russia, you put your own life in someone else's hands, actually. I can read a list--but I won't tonight--of all of the leaders and rising leaders of countries that wish to be free that Russia has summarily killed, for which there is no justice.  Madam Speaker, I rise somewhat out of outrage tonight listening to some of our colleagues here who demanded that we disband Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. Counsel Mueller is a I should not like him for that reason, right, because I am a Democrat? But I know there is something bigger to him, and that is defending the American people against all enemies, foreign and domestic. He has put his life on the line since he was a teenager for this country.  Our country was founded on the principle of equality under the law. Our democracy, in the safeguarding of those principles, depends on genuine free elections. Not only must we pass laws here that assure that, but they have to be enforced.  We have to unequivocally confirm the truth behind the extent of Russian meddling in our election. That is what we need. We know they did. Now we want to know every piece of it.  How did they hack those voting machines? How did they use special ads that appeared around the country targeted to special audiences?  We have to restore the faith of the American people in their very vote in order to maintain this democratic republic.  Throughout his career, Special Counsel Mueller has proven himself time and time and time and time again to be a man of integrity.  I might say, this comes from a woman who tried to become an FBI agent when she was in college and was rejected not because she didn't have the academic abilities, but because in those days they didn't admit women to the Times have changed a lot, but I know that Robert Mueller is the best that America has.  Due process is one of the most carefully guarded of our constitutional protections, and we must see this investigation through to its ultimate end.  There can be no chicken hawks in this House or those who point fingers whose careers do not demonstrate the kind of patriotism Robert Mueller has demonstrated throughout his career.  Madam Speaker, I was actually shocked at how the questioning went this afternoon without the kind of respect and understanding of what it takes to preserve a republic that is free and independent of outside meddling.  I want to thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak. I am embarrassed at some of the questions that the Republican majority has been hammering over in the Judiciary Committee and some of the other committees as the investigation intensifies and becomes more complete. The American people have a right to know.  I guess the question every American has to ask: In whose hands would you place your life? A man who has served this country, who is now, I believe, 73 years old--over 70 years old?  He has proved everything, but he has proven also that he has been a total patriot.  I would ask the same of those who so frivolously waste their words in efforts to try to suppress an investigation that we know is essential to the preservation of our vote and our freedoms.

This Friday, December 15, is the deadline to sign up for open enrollment for them and for their family.                              {time}  1045  If you don't do that, you won't have a chance, really, to buy that health insurance next year. If you haven't already bought your health insurance for 2018, to get details about available plans, please visit the website, healthcare.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596--that is healthcare.gov, or 1-800-318-2596. You will actually get to talk to a real person.  In order to get in touch with someone local who can help you sign up for insurance in your own area, you call that same number, 1-800-318-2596, or you can go to the website that is called localhelp.healthcare.gov--localhelp.healthcare.gov.  Health insurance is vital. It can protect us from astronomical cost when a serious accident or illness occurs, because the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is $30,000. A broken leg, on average, costs $7,500. Having a baby, on average, in States like Ohio, costs $6,000.  Health insurance is your lifeline. It helps protect you and your family from unexpected costs and, frankly, possible bankruptcy, because over two-thirds of people in our country that go bankrupt do so because of health bills they can't pay.  What happens is, if they have a house, they lose the house. It is confiscated to pay the medical bills. They lose their credit rating. It is a terrible thing that happens to people when they get sick, and it is just a roll of the dice on who is going to get cancer, who is going to get appendicitis, who is going to become ill, who is going to be hit in a hit-and-run accident around this country.  Coverage choices are affordable on these exchanges, and, in many cases, financial help is available. During last year's enrollment period, believe it or not, 8 in 10 people qualified for financial help. For most people, that meant they could find insurance premiums for as little as $100 a month or less.  For example, CareNet, a provider network in Ohio, recently helped to enroll a gentleman who has cancer and was previously uninsured. Can you imagine that? Who can afford these infusions? This man spent an entire year without oncology treatment and certainly needs multiple surgeries now. Because of the Affordable Care Act and through the help of CareNet, he found a plan that costs $100 a month. He thought he would have to pay much more, but he will now be able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2018. Thank God he got coverage.  Actually, many working people can qualify for For example, a family of four earning $33,000 in Ohio can get coverage through Please know you can apply for and enroll in Medicaid at any time of the year. Even if you don't have health insurance, you should definitely look into that if you do not have health insurance.  Every American is required to have health insurance through their employer--but a lot of employers don't provide it--through Medicare, Medicaid, or through purchase of plans on the individual marketplace. Health insurance provides you and your family with health security and piece of mind, paying costs when you need medical care.  The marketplace provides access to quality and affordable health coverage, which requires insurers to cover certain benefits such as prescriptions, emergency care, mental healthcare, and preventive services. It is important to highlight that more than 68 million people rely on Medicaid, and 9 million children rely on the Children's Health Insurance  Now, Republicans in Congress have let the children's program lapse. Unfortunately, Federal funding for that program helps over 220,000 children in Ohio, and 73 days ago, the Republican Congress said: Sorry, America's children, we are going to put you on hold for the moment.  Whether that program will be funded or not is all caught up in these end-of-year discussions that are occurring here at a very high level. America's children should be covered with insurance.  The Republican-led Congress has also let Federal funding for community health centers, a resource critical to millions of our families, lapse also since September 30. They best restore that. Why hurt the American people? Why would you do that?  Once again, please visit healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 to sign up for your health insurance for 2018.

No reasonable person can look at America's current tax system and be impressed. For one thing, it is enormously complicated. It is 10 million words. You can stand on it and paint this ceiling.  I don't want to just talk about technicalities here because most Americans don't have time to worry about section 106(a) or section 807(b). They are too busy getting up every day and going to work and obeying the law and paying their taxes. They just want to know what the bottom line is.  So let me tell them what the bottom line is. We are going to pass a tax bill that is going to cut about $1.4 billion in taxes for the American people and the American businesswomen and the American businessmen over 10 years.  Let me talk, first, about the impact on people--ordinary people, Mr.President, like you and We are going to double the standard deduction. Why is that important? Right now, about 70 percent of Americans take the standard deduction. After we double it, probably about 90 percent will. The President is right. You will be able to file your taxes on a postcard if you want to. For Americans who have children, we are going to double the children's tax credit. We are going to lower every marginal tax rate. I know you have been told we are only going to help the wealthy. That is just not true. We are lowering every single tax rate. I am very proud of the fact that this bill starts--it doesn't end, but it starts with helping our middle class.  In my State, a mom and dad working hard, making $75,000 a year--mom makes 30-plus thousand and dad makes 30-plus thousand, and they have two children--right now, they pay about $3,500, $3,700 in Federal income taxes. Now, of course, that is not all they pay. They pay payroll taxes, they pay State taxes, and they pay local taxes. In fact, government taxes everything now at all levels. Government now taxes the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the homes we live in. Government started thinking it owns all our money. Government taxes us when we work. Government taxes us when we play. Government taxes us when we die. So when I tell you that a couple making $73,000, $75,000 in my State is paying $3,750, roughly, in Federal income tax, I don't want you to think that is all.  The point I am trying to make is, after we pass this bill, that couple is going to pay about $1,500, $1,700, $1,400 in Federal income taxes. That mom and dad who, as I said before, get up every day and go to work and obey the law and try to do the right thing by their kids and try to save a little money for retirement and try to teach their children values is going to have an extra couple thousand dollars in their paycheck, and that is a lot of money. It is to me, and I know it is to you, and it is going to be a lot of money for that mom and dad.  This bill is also going to help every businesswoman and businessman in Yes, it is going to help our large corporations. Right now, we tax them at a rate of 35 percent. This bill is going to reduce that to 21 percent, but it is not just going to help large businesses, it is going to help small businesses as well. I am talking about the subchapter S corporations and the LLCs and the LLPs and the sole proprietorships. I am talking about the family farms. I am talking about the American who decided to take a risk to create some jobs, start a small business, went and took a second mortgage on her home, maybe employs four or five people. If she fails in her business, government is not going to be there to bail her out. She is going to lose her home, but she wants to take a risk, to be her own boss, to create jobs in We are going to cut her taxes too.  The passthrough rate, the top marginal tax rate, by my calculations after this bill is passed, is going to be about 29.6 percent. Right now, the top marginal tax rate for that businesswoman would be about 43 percent. And you say: Well, the small businesses get a 26-percent rate. Why do the big corporations get 21 percent?  Because the big corporations pay taxes twice. Saying they are going to pay 21 percent in our bill isn't the only part of it. When they declare dividends, they have to pay taxes again. So that is the reason for the disparity.  Let me tell you why this is important. So many of my colleagues--in fact, every one of my colleagues in the Senate says that they are for jobs. We are all for jobs, but you can't be for jobs if you are against business. You can't.  Businessmen and businesswomen need four things from government. They need reasonable regulation--not no regulation, reasonable regulation; they need a decent infrastructure; they need a skilled workforce; and they need low taxes. That is what government is supposed to provide. And then, in a free enterprise system like ours, government needs to get out of its way and let the free enterprise system work, which has lifted more people out of poverty than all the social programs put together.  Our bill is going to provide lower taxes. We have a lot of differences of opinion in this body. Some of my colleagues--most of whom happen to be Democrats--believe that it is possible to tax this country into prosperity. Once again, I say this with all the respect I can muster: They are in good faith in believing that. This is You can believe what you want. But if they believe that, then they were in the quad throwing a frisbee during economics 101. And that is just a fact.  Some of the opponents of this bill have suggested that tax policy has absolutely nothing to do with our economy, with economic growth. Once again, with all the respect I can muster, I would ask them very respectfully: What planet did you just parachute in from? Average Americans understand, ordinary Americans understand, people who work for a living understand that when you tax something, you get less of it, and when you tax it less, you get more of it.  This is a solid bill. It is not perfect. If I were king for a day--I am not, and I don't want to be--I would make some[[Page S8032]]changes. But reasonable people disagree sometimes, and I believe this body will come together.  I hope we get some Democratic votes because I think that in their hearts, some of our Democratic friends want to vote for this bill. They do. We will see whether or not they do, but I believe they do. But we are going to pass this legislation, and the American people are going to be better off. It is not going to add to the deficit. I would not vote for this legislation if I thought it would hurt us long term in terms of our deficit.

They are also leaving behind some really important Americans: our Native American brothers and sisters.  For years, issues of taxation and how Federal tax policy impacts Tribal governments have been the subject of discussion, and for those years that we have talked about the need for tax reform, there have been continuous promises made to Tribal governments that we will deal with these inequities, these issues of double taxation in  For example, a Tribal member who gets an adoption through a Tribal court doesn't qualify for an adoption tax credit.

The families of those we lost and all the folks affected by this are in my prayers tonight.  Mr.Speaker, on May 25, 1961, President John Kennedy came before this body and gave an urgent special address. He laid out the costs of supporting the space program and of going to the Moon, and he said: ``We choose to go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.''  Today, Mr.Speaker, that journey continues as we take a vote to formalize sharing a space partnership between our Nation and a close ally and friend, the nation of  This partnership began in 1985 when NASA and the Israel Space Agency began cooperating on a limited basis. A decade later, our Nation signed an agreement to allow Israeli astronauts to begin training with their American counterparts.  In 2003, Israeli Air Force Colonel Ilan Ramon became the first Israeli astronaut. He traveled to space aboard the Space Shuttle It was a 16-day mission, and the crew of six Americans and one Israeli conducted 80 experiments that helped us understand our place in the universe just a little bit better.  Tragically, the celebration of this partnership turned to shared mourning as Columbia was lost on reentry, but the tragedy did not stop our shared journey into space. To this day, we continue to cooperate, including on projects everyone benefits from, including the Global Positioning System, and research that helps us better understand the Sun, and even research related to our environment here on  In 2015, NASA and the Israel Space Agency signed a civil space framework agreement to formalize and expand cooperation in civil space activities.  Mr.Speaker, today's vote continues a deep and lasting partnership among free societies. I have been proud to work with a number of my colleagues and NASA and everyday Americans who know that all mankind benefits when we explore our universe.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for his leadership on these issues and the ranking member, who has been such a champion in support of smart policies in the arena of science, space, and technology. I also would like to thank the majority and minority staff from the committee for the work that they do.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

25,topic-id,2211,"Madam President, I rise today to talk not about legislation or about the tax bill--well, I may talk about the tax bill a little--but I do wish to talk about deadlines and how we all do our work, whether it is in the Senate, in our businesses, or in our personal lives. I wish to talk about deadlines missed and deadlines that don't exist.  One of the realities of this place that I think is very unfortunate is that we rarely make our deadlines. These are self-imposed deadlines. These are deadlines that we create. We pass a law that says something has to happen by September 30. We set the deadline, and then we don't make it.  Most notoriously, it happens with budgets. I don't know the last time we had a budget on time. I think it is about 17 years ago. I suspect there are probably less than a dozen Senators in this Chamber who were here when we last passed a budget on time. There is[[Page S8057]]no excuse for that. The problem is that when we put it off, we don't know anything more than we did at the time of the deadline. We could have done it, and yet, because we are able to, we put it off. That is human nature, unfortunately. Who among us would not have put off the deadline for a book report if we could have said to the teacher: Gee, I don't think I can make that Monday morning deadline. I will just do my book report on  Life doesn't work that way. In the real world, there are deadlines. There are consequences if you don't get your work done on time. Things happen, and if you don't get your work done on time, usually, those things that happen are bad. I don't know where else, other than in this body, where deadlines, which have enormous implications and enormous importance, are simply ignored.  I just sat down in the last day or so and put together real deadlines that we have in the law right now. What are they? Well, the Children's Health Insurance Program's deadline is September 30, 2017. That is gone. That has passed. I can give you 23,000 reasons that we should have met that deadline. That is the number of young people in Maine who are covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program, and there are 9 million nationwide. But we missed the deadline. Why? I can't find any reason. We don't know anything now that we didn't know in the middle of September or in August when we could have passed this program, but we just blew right by it. Maybe it is because none of our kids are in this program. I venture to say that if the children of the Members of the Senate were in the CHIP program, we would have met that deadline, but we didn't.  What is another one? Community health centers had another deadline of September 30, which was missed. I will give you 200,000 reasons that we should have met that deadline. That is the number of people in my State of Maine who are served by federally qualified health centers. I was at one just on They serve people who otherwise wouldn't get care. They fill an enormous gap, particularly in a rural State, to provide healthcare to people who need it, but we didn't make the deadline. There was no particular reason not to make this deadline. We just blew right by it. It was not all that important. I venture to say that if our families were covered under this program, we would have gotten it done. No Senators' families are covered by federally qualified health centers. If they had been, we would have gotten it done.  Of course, the granddaddy of all of deadlines mentioned is the budget: October 1, 2017. We missed it--no deadline. We just went right by it. Nothing happened. Well, what we did was to pass a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution really should be called a ``cop-out resolution.'' It is basically saying that we are not going to make the hard decisions in a budget. We are just going to push them forward for a month or two. But the problem is that the month or two comes. In fact, it is coming this Friday, and now we are talking about another continuing resolution to go into January or No business would do this. Families can't even do this.  Some time ago, I was the Governor of I remember vividly. I can practically tell you where I was standing in my office. We have a deadline in Maine of July 1 for our budget. We always make it. Members of the legislature of one of the parties came to me. They were having a hard time getting a budget. It was very contentious, as it is every year. He said: Governor, let's just do a continuing resolution like they do in Washington, and we can solve this problem in the next 2 weeks. I said: Not on your life, because if we do, once we open the Pandora's box of continuing resolutions in Maine or in Iowa or in Mississippi or Florida, then we are stuck. We will never get a budget on time again because it is too easy to put off the hard decisions. What do we know now about the budget that we didn't know in August? What will we know in January that we don't know now?  By the way, a continuing resolution for the entire budget is bad for the government and disastrous for national security. I serve on the Armed Services We have hearings both from our civilian leadership and our military leadership, and they have told us repeatedly: Please get us a budget. The continuing resolution doesn't allow us to plan. It locks us into last year's priorities. It doesn't allow us to look forward and make commitments that will save the taxpayers money if we have the authority. It is a disaster for national security, but a deadline was missed on September 30. It looks like we are going to miss another deadline on December 22, and we will be here talking about funding the government, doing the budget, sometime in January or maybe in There is no reason for it. There is no reason for it except that we are simply avoiding making difficult decisions.  The next one is DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood The real deadline started on October 6. That is when people started to lose the ability to re-up their qualifications for Over 100 people a day are losing their DACA status. In the last week it has been, I think, something like 1,700--in the last week or 10 days. These are people who are going to go into the holidays unsure about whether they are going to be able to continue to live in this country. These are young people, as we all know. This is the only country they know. They were brought here as little kids. They weren't illegal immigrants. They were brought here as children, and they are contributing to our society, and they are working and paying taxes. But we missed the deadline starting in  Now, even the President said we should fix this program, and he gave us 6 months. He said: I am going to disallow the program, but not until March 5, 2018. I don't know whether it is legal to bet in the District of Columbia, but I would be willing to bet that we are still struggling with this question on March 4, 2018. I deeply hope not because lives are being toyed with here unnecessarily. We could make the decisions now. We could decide to reach a compromise agreement on this program, which Members of both sides of the aisle think needs to be done, including the Let's get it done. But it is one more missed deadline.  Next is the National Flood Insurance Program, with a deadline of December 22, which is 4 days from now. I don't think we are going to make it. If ever there was a time of importance for the National Flood Insurance Program, it is now. We have had enormous flooding issues with the hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Yet the flood insurance program expires on December 22. Why don't we get it done? Because it is not our houses. It is not our houses that are at risk to get the flood insurance. I suspect if we had the houses that were part of this problem, it would be solved.  Medicare extenders expire on December 31 of this year. Are we going to get those done? I deeply hope so, but I am not so sure.  FISA section 702, one of the most important national intelligence provisions that we have, also expires at the end of the year. Are we going to get that done? I deeply hope so, but I am not optimistic.  Next, we have the wildfires and FEMA disaster aid for Harvey, Irma, Maria, and the wildfires. These are huge disasters. We have partially funded them, but certainly not to the point that is going to be required. Those deadlines were all this fall.  At the bottom of my chart of priorities is tax reform. Boy, are we going to make that deadline. The only problem is that it doesn't exist. There is no deadline for that. There was no deadline. It is not December 22. It is not It is not New Year's. It is a self-imposed deadline that is not in law anywhere.  I agree that we need to do tax reform, but we have been doing it on an unprecedented scale and speed that is unnecessary. We have missed and ignored all these real deadlines in exchange for focusing all of our attention on a fake deadline. Sure, it would be nice to get it done, and we could have gotten it done. It could have been done on a bipartisan basis. We could have started last summer, and we would have had a bill just like the bill that emerged from the HELP Committee with regard to healthcare, on a bipartisan basis. But instead it was a closed process, done with unprecedented speed, with virtually no hearings--well,[[Page S8058]]no hearings, no real hearings on the bill, no serious outside experts, no analysis of what is in it. We have been given a 500-page bill that we are going to vote on in probably a day or so. Yet we are racing to meet a deadline that didn't exist.  It is boring to talk about process, but that is what I am really talking about today. I just don't understand an institution that doesn't make its real deadlines and yet races and throws everything aside to try to make a deadline that just came out of the air. It is not in any law, any rule, any expectation--let's do it by Christmas or by the end of the year. It is no way to run a business, and it is certainly no way to run the government on behalf of the American people.  I have never been in an institution or in a group of people who are as capable as the people who are here, and I find it genuinely puzzling as to why we perform so poorly and why the public opinion of us is so low. These are good people on both sides of the aisle. Yet something about the way this institution works keeps us from meeting the rules and expectations that the rest of society takes for granted, such as making deadlines, doing your job, doing what you are paid to do.  One of the most fundamental responsibilities is to pass a budget. We have members of our Appropriations Committee who have been working for a year to put the budget together. It is done, and we could do this, but instead we are putting it off and putting it off and putting it off. I wouldn't be surprised if, come January or February--assuming we don't make it by this Friday--there are going to be people who say: Let's just do a continuing resolution for the rest of the year--a cop-out resolution, a nonresolution, a nondecision on behalf of the people of this country.  I think we can do better. I think we can begin to regain the trust of the American people by going back and doing things the way we are supposed to according to the old norms, with hearings and considerations and making deadlines and meeting our obligations to our citizens and to our country.  I deeply hope that as the year turns, we also make a turn and that we make a turn to do this place better, to do our work that the American people hired us to do, to do it on a timely basis, and to meet our responsibilities. I believe we can do it. I believe we can do it better, and I deeply hope that we do so.  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.

706,topic-id,1282,"Madam President, I rise to join with the Senator from Vermont in opposition to the FCC's planned vote to end net neutrality protections.  Tomorrow, as he noted, the FCC will hold a vote on Chairman Pai's plan to eliminate net neutrality. These rules have kept the internet free and open, and in a day where a lot of things aren't working, this was something that was actually working. People were able to access the internet, people in my State who maybe didn't have a lot of resources. Kids were able to access the internet to do their homework. It was working. If the FCC votes to abandon net neutrality, it will put internet service providers, not consumers, in charge of determining the future of the internet.  Net neutrality holds internet service providers--big mega-internet service providers--accountable for providing the internet access consumers expect while protecting innovation and competition. It is the bedrock of a fast, free, and open internet.  Net neutrality has allowed the internet to become one of the great American success stories, transforming not only how we communicate with our friends and our family but the way we do business, how consumers buy goods, and how we educate our kids. These protections have worked. We have rural kids who couldn't access classes before who are able to get these classes on the internet. We have small businesses that are able to advertise their services in a way that no one would have known that they existed. One of my favorite ones is a company called Weave Got Maille, and they are doing chain jewelry. It is just a group of about 10, 15 employees up there who started with nothing but one chain. Then they were able to come up with a cool nickname, and then they were able to advertise on the internet directly to consumers. Now they are one of the biggest employers in the town right on the Canadian border.  These internet protections that have allowed small businesses to blossom have allowed consumers to access the internet like everyone else. They have worked, but with the FCC's vote tomorrow, the internet may soon be changing.  Earlier this year, when Chairman Pai announced his proposal to eliminate net neutrality protections, Americans took the opportunity to make their voices heard during the public comment hearing, and the proposal received a record 23 million comments. While many of these comments are written by consumers worried about the future of the internet, there is reason to be concerned about that process. Approximately 1 million fraudulent comments were filed with the FCC, and an additional half a million comments were filed with Russian email addresses. Sound familiar? I think so.  I think everyone in this Chamber knows Russia has been trying to influence our democracy in every way they can--from hacking to putting out propaganda, to now trying to insert itself into a comment process for our free and open internet, something that has[[Page S7986]]been the hallmark of American society, something they don't have in Just think, an additional half a million comments were filed from Russian email addresses. This is troubling because, in America, the public comment process matters. It is one of the few opportunities Americans have to weigh in directly with the That is why I joined several of my colleagues in calling on Chairman Pai to delay the vote until the FCC fully investigated these fake and foreign comments. Despite our calls, the FCC is still moving ahead with its vote. Despite 23 million comments, they are still moving ahead with their vote.  Under Chairman Pai's plan, the FCC gives internet service providers the ability to significantly change consumers' experience online. Internet service providers may soon be able to block, slow, and prioritize web traffic for their own financial gain, not for the average citizens' gain but for their gain. This means, internet service providers could begin sorting online traffic into fast or slow lanes and charging consumers extra for high-speed broadband. They would also be able to slow consumers' connections once they have hit a certain data limit or if they are viewing content from a competitor, and internet service providers may even block content they don't want their subscribers to access. So much for an open internet.  The only protections maintained under the proposed order are requirements for service providers to disclose their internet traffic policies. However, for consumers with only one choice for internet service, like many in my State and like many in rural areas, there is no real opportunity to comparison shop or find a new provider if they are unhappy with their service. This means that even though consumers may be aware that their internet service provider is blocking or slowing their connection, they actually don't have a choice so what does that information matter to them anyway? This proposal will harm consumers, particularly in rural areas. It will limit competition, and it will hurt small business, entrepreneurship, and innovation.  What I have seen around this place is that everyone is talking about rural broadband. They want to expand broadband. I want to expand broadband. Well, you can expand broadband all you want, but it is not going to matter if people aren't able to afford to access it.  A truly open internet encourages economic growth and provides opportunities for businesses to reach new markets, drive innovation, and create jobs. Small businesses remain engines of job creation, and net neutrality levels the playing field, allowing small companies to compete with more established brands. That is what America is about--allowing more innovation and small companies to come up and compete.  Unfortunately, for small businesses and startups across the country, the net neutrality repeal will mean new barriers when competing online. Without unrestricted access to the internet, entrepreneurs may be forced to pay for equal footing to compete online rather than focus on expanding their business. Small businesses unable to pay for access to faster internet service may soon find themselves struggling to compete from the slow lane, not the fast lane. This proposal will hurt the very people creating jobs and keeping our economy competitive.  As a strong supporter of a free and open internet, it is clear that repealing net neutrality is a step in the wrong direction. We are facing an increasingly global and interconnected economy, and it is critical that the internet remain a hub of entrepreneurship, creativity, and fair competition.  The fight to protect net neutrality is far from over, and we need to keep the pressure on. We have seen merger after merger after merger. We have seen consolidated businesses, bigger and bigger and bigger. So now what is the next step here? To limit net neutrality to make it harder for the small guys, for the ones who are trying to get into the market to compete. It is not just an isolated philosophy; it is actually part of a larger philosophy, which means that smaller companies, that individuals are going to have a hard time getting into the market and getting free access like the big guys.  That is why we ask Chairman Pai to reconsider this vote on Thursday and to come up with a new policy that doesn't hurt the people of  It is no surprise today that the poll I saw said the vast majority of Americans don't favor getting rid of net neutrality, and in fact it showed the vast majority of Republicans don't favor getting rid of net neutrality. So we ask Chairman Pai, who was appointed chairman by a Republican President, to reconsider this decision.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

833,topic-id,2255,"Mr.President, I stand today to call for bipartisan action on several things that are really critical. One of them has become routine, since it started as a bill that Democrats and Republicans did together. That was the Children's Health Insurance Program, something that my colleague from Vermont has referenced.  In my State, we have been a good-government We have had a budget surplus for years, and, believe it or not, we relied on the fact that Congress would come through and do what they were supposed to do and reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, but that didn't happen. As a result, we have a slight budget deficit--something we haven't had for years. But it really hit home when I called our budget director in the State and I said: How did this happen when we have had these surpluses?  He said: Well, we actually thought that you guys would reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, but you didn't.  Instead, what we have seen is a tax bill that adds over a trillion dollars to the debt. Even when you take into account any economic gain from that bill, a nonpartisan group said that it would, in fact, add $1 trillion to the debt. That is what we are doing instead of reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, which makes no sense to me.  Funding for CHIP expired more than 2 months ago, even though, as I said, it is one of the success stories out of this Both parties have come together for years to support this program that provides healthcare to millions of children across the country.  In Minnesota, these funds support coverage for more than 125,000 kids. Just last week, my State estimated that failing to reauthorize CHIP would cost us $178 million. That is why the[[Page S7960]]deficit was at $188 million. So the CHIP funding that our State has come to rely on through Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents has suddenly gone away--that is why we have a deficit--while at the same time, a decision has been made by my colleagues on the other side to add over $1 trillion to the debt. I don't know what to tell the people in my State, except that tax cuts for the wealthy appear to be a priority rather than reauthorizing this bill to help kids get their health insurance. Guess what. They don't understand that reasoning.  States like mine are running out of ways to make Federal funding last a little bit longer. Every single day that we don't act puts coverage at risk for millions of kids. Some States have already been forced to tell parents to start making other plans for their kids' healthcare. No parent should ever have to worry about whether their child will have healthcare. We must keep this strong program going. I have also heard from families with kids who get treatment at the children's hospitals and clinics of Minnesota and who count on this program for the medical care they need. That is why we must pass the bipartisan bill Senators Hatch and Wyden have put together to extend CHIP for 5 years--so we can stop this nonsense and tell people back at home that actually something is working here.  In 2015, the last time we renewed the program, it passed the Senate with 92 votes. We should demonstrate that same bipartisan spirit again. We should not hold these kids hostage with this bickering, and we certainly shouldn't be holding all of the States hostage either. This makes no sense. We must act before it is too late, or States like mine will not just have a deficit as a result of this, they will be forced to make difficult choices about insurance coverage for some of our most vulnerable constituents. CHIP is one part of our healthcare system that nearly everyone agrees works. We should be doing everything in our power to protect it.  In addition to CHIP, the American people want us to work together to make fixes to the Affordable Care They don't want us to repeal it; we have seen that in the numbers. They want us to make some sensible changes. You can never pass a bill with that kind of breadth and reach without making some changes to it. I said on the day that it passed that it was a beginning and not an end.  I am a cosponsor of the bill Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have put together because it is an important step forward and exactly the type of sensible, bipartisan legislation that we should pass. The bill has 11 Republican cosponsors and 11 Democratic cosponsors. Patient groups, doctor groups, and consumer groups have praised it, including the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the Arthritis Foundation--and those are just some of the A's. There are hundreds of national health groups who support this bill. They have Democratic members and they have Republican members. They just want to get something done.  Senators Alexander and Murray held a series of hearings and discussions on commonsense solutions to bring down insurance costs with Senators on both sides of the aisle.  I fought for a provision in this bipartisan legislation that would help States like mine apply for and receive waivers. This was put together, by the way, in our State by a Republican legislature and a Democratic It is a plan that would bring down premium costs, a plan that made sense across the board and was broadly supported in our Our Federal Government should be encouraging that kind of flexibility. The waiver we are asking for is actually something we would like to see other States do. The provision we included in the Murray-Alexander bill would encourage other States to do exactly what we did; that is, apply for waivers for flexibility to bring down rates without getting penalized.  This bill would also expedite the review of waiver applications for proposals that have already been approved for other  This legislation also shortens the overall time period that States have to wait for the Federal Government to decide whether to approve their waivers. The last time I checked, I thought this administration was touting the fact that they like to get things done, that they want to move things faster, and that they don't like the redtape of bureaucracy. Well, here we have a bill that actually says that States shouldn't have to wait for the Federal Government to make decisions. Why can't we get it passed?  Not only does the bill improve the process for waivers--this is my favorite part because when you hear me talk about it, you might think, wow, this must be expensive. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that the Alexander-Murray bill would actually cut the deficit by $3.8 billion over the next 10 years because it simply gives States the flexibility to cope with the issues they are having in their own States, to adjust to their own particular circumstances, and to make it easier for people to afford healthcare, while saving money for the Federal It makes no sense to delay by even 1 day the passage of this legislation, nor does it make any sense to cut all those kids off of health insurance.  Renewing the Children's Health Insurance Program and passing Murray-Alexander would be important steps forward, but we still must do more. I don't think we are going to get all my prescription drug bills passed by the end of the year, but we should. We won't, but we should. That doesn't mean I am giving up. I think the American people aren't giving up because they have been able to see clear-eyed what is going on because they are starting to see what is happening with the cost of their prescription drugs. The costs are skyrocketing.  I have heard from people across Minnesota who are struggling to afford the medicine they need. This is about the woman in Duluth who told me that she chose not to fill her last prescription because that one drug would cost a full 25 percent of her income. This is about the woman in Paul who, even with Medicare, can't afford a $663-a-month cost for medicine that she needs. This is about a woman from Crystal, MN, who told me: ``I am practically going without food to pay for my prescriptions.'' It is heartbreaking that this is happening in  Reducing the costs of prescription drugs has bipartisan support in Congress, and the President has said that he cares about this. So why can't we get this done?  I have one bill that has 33 cosponsors that lifts the ban that makes it illegal for Medicare to negotiate prices for Part D prescription drugs for 41 million American seniors. Yes, right now, it is in law that we can't negotiate for 41 million seniors. Last time I checked, I think they would have a lot of bargaining power, but right now, we can't do that.  A bill Senator McCain and I have would allow Americans to bring safe, less expensive drugs from  A third bill that Republican Senator Grassley and I have is to stop something called pay-for-delay, where big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off their generic competitors to keep less expensive products off the market. How can that kind of practice be any good for American consumers? Guess what. It is not. We need to put an end to this outrageous practice. This bill would save taxpayers $2.9 billion.  Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there isn't healthy competition for that drug in this country. Believe me, there are plenty of areas where we don't have healthy competition, where Americans aren't getting the kinds of deals they should get.  I have a bipartisan bill with Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Lee, and several others called the CREATES Act to put a stop to other pharmaceutical company tactics--such as refusing to provide samples--that delay more affordable generic drugs from getting to consumers. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save approximately $3.6 billion.  People in this Chamber are talking about saving money. How are they doing it? On the backs of kids. They are talking about saving money. How are they doing it? On the backs of Americans who would like to afford premiums.[[Page S7961]]  I have laid out a number of bills that actually have been scored to save money. Passing the Alexander-Murray bipartisan bill would save us money. We have the actual accounting to show it. Allowing for less expensive drugs from other countries would save money for consumers. It is pretty easy to understand. It is called capitalism. It creates competition.  For our own American drug companies--we are proud that they have developed lifesaving cures. They are important employers in our country. But if they refuse to bring down those prices and if they have a monopoly on the market, we should be bringing in competition. There are two ways to do it. One is generic, and that is making it easier to produce generic drugs, and also stopping big pharma companies from paying off generic companies--their competition--to keep their competitive products off the market. The other is simply allowing drugs from less expensive places, but safe places, like That is a bill I have put forward with Senator McCain, but also Senator Bernie Sanders and I have worked on this, as well as many others. These are commonsense ideas. Yet we cannot even move to a vote. Why? Because the pharmaceutical companies don't want us to have that vote.  So I am asking my colleagues, 1, let's end the year with some common sense and pass two commonsense bills to help the American people with their healthcare, and those are the children's health insurance bill and the Alexander-Murray compromise to make some fixes to the Affordable Care Then, when people are home for a week over the holidays, maybe they should start talking to their constituents, as I have. Maybe they should talk to their friends and their neighbors and see what they think about what is going on with prescription drug prices. Maybe they will come back with a New Year's resolution that they are no longer going to be completely beholden to the pharmaceutical companies, that they are willing to give the American people some relief and take these companies on and create some competition for  I thought this was supposed to be a capitalistic system. In a capitalistic system, you do not have monopolies for certain drugs. You do not have a drug like insulin, which has been around for decades, triple, so that one elderly constituent in my State actually saves the drops at the bottom of the injectors so they can use them the next day. That is what is happening, while at the pharmaceutical companies, they are taking home big bonuses at the end of the year.  I implore my colleagues, let's get these commonsense things done so you can go home and not think, when you are sitting there at your holiday dinner, that you have basically left millions of kids without healthcare, and then on New Year's, the next week, make a resolution to do what is right for your constituents, not for the pharmaceutical companies.

927,topic-id,1575,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in expressing my support for taking action on the Dream Act, as well as to express my continued opposition to the administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood  I thank my colleague Senator Durbin for organizing today's remarks, as well as for his years of leadership and tireless advocacy on behalf of the Dreamers, along with Senator Graham, who is leading this very important bill with Senator  It is critically important that the Senate pass the Dream Act and not wait any longer to take action. There are 22,000 eligible DACA recipients who did not meet the administration's deadline to renew their statuses, and as a result, about 122 Dreamers are now losing their DACA statuses every day. That is more than 11,000 who have already lost their statuses as of today, and that number will continue to increase every single day that we fail to act. This is nothing on which we can wait--wait a week, wait 1 month, wait 2 months. Every single day, it affects more people. So, while some have suggested that we wait until March to fix this issue, the reality is that the Senate needs to take action now.  Since it was first established in 2012, DACA has helped nearly 800,000 young people who have lived since childhood in the United States to better contribute to their families and communities, including more than 6,000 who are in my I recently met with the archbishop of the Twin Cities, along with some of these Dreamers, and we talked about how important this was to the fabric of life in our[[Page S8013]]community, to our economy in Minnesota--where we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country--to the Dreamers, and to their communities, themselves.  The Dreamers were brought to our country as children, and they know only one home. That is the United States of The average Dreamer has called this country home since he was about 6\1/2\ years old. That is the average. Dreamers serve in our military; they pay taxes; and they contribute to communities across our country. More than 97 percent of Dreamers are now in school or in the workforce--97 percent--and all DACA recipients are required to meet the program's education requirements. In fact, 72 percent of all DACA recipients who are currently in school are pursuing bachelor's degrees or higher. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, more than 100 students with DACA status applied to medical school last year. This is at a time when we have a shortage of doctors in my State, particularly in the rural areas.  The administration's decision to end DACA has created tremendous uncertainty and the risk of deportation for the Dreamers who work and study in the States across our It, simply, doesn't make economic sense. One recent study estimated that ending this policy would cost the country over $400 billion over the next 10 years.  I would like to point out to my colleagues that for immigrants as a whole, 25 percent of our U.Nobel laureates were born in other countries and that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed up by immigrants. Why would we cut off this talent flow? Look at these DACA recipients. Ninety-seven percent of the Dreamers are working or are in school.  That is why I strongly disagree with the President's decision to end DACA, as do many Republicans, Democrats, business, labor, and religious leaders, and it is why I support the bipartisan Durbin-Graham Dream America is truly a country built by immigrants, but just as importantly, these immigrants and their families have helped America succeed. They have been part of our Nation's greatest achievements.  I look at my own family.  On my dad's side, my great-grandparents came from My great-grandfather worked in the mine, and my grandpa worked in the mine because they needed people to mine iron ore in order to make all of the armaments and all of the ships that helped us to win World War That happened. They were so proud of what they had done to contribute to our country's efforts.  On my mom's side, my actual grandparents, who were Swiss, came to this country--my grandma as a 3-year-old, to Wisconsin, with her parents.  My grandpa, when he was about 18 years old, came over. He found out that there was a limit on Swiss immigrants. He somehow got through Canada and then got through to He met my grandma and had my mom and her brother, my Uncle Dick, and, at some point, decided that he would try to change his status from ``alien'' to ``legal immigrant.'' That was when the Congress had just passed the Alien Registration Because World War II was before us, he had to register. That went smoothly, so he decided to apply for citizenship. That was when they discovered that he had entered the country twice--once when he had said that he was going to Canada, on Ellis Island--but he went to Canada only for a week--and the second time when he had gotten through to  I don't know what would have happened to my grandpa now. Back then, he went through the immigration hearing; he got his status. There is a picture of him in his bow tie--in an old black and white--and he is smiling. He was much older than when he had come to our country and become a citizen. I don't know what would have happened, because what he had done wasn't really legal.  Back then, they said: Do you know what? We want you in our country. You are a worker. You have raised two kids. You live in We want you to be a citizen. They gave him that citizenship just a few weeks before the United States entered World War Otherwise, I guess he would have been deported to Switzerland right in the middle of the war.  That is my story, and everyone has an immigrant story.  The Senate-passed bill, when we did comprehensive reform--and I was one of the people very involved in that on the Judiciary Committee--included a version of the DREAM Act, which would have created a path to citizenship for those eligible for DACA who had graduated from high school and gone on to complete higher education or to serve in the military. We must end this uncertainty for That is why I have joined with so many of my colleagues in calling on Leader McConnell to hold a vote.  Here is a Dreamer whom I will never forget. I was trying to find examples for people in my State so that they may understand what this ``Dreamer'' term is all about, and I found one a few years ago--Joseph At the time, he was 99 years old, and he was a decorated Army veteran. We lost him only last month at age 103. He told me his story back when he was 99.  He was brought to our country from Mexico when he was 5 years old. He had no idea that he was not born in our country. He grew up in Sleepy Eye, Then he signed up to serve in World War That was when they had found out that he was, in fact, undocumented and had not been born in our country. Back then, as he had described it to me, the military had wanted people to serve, so they had him go to At the direction of our military, he went to Canada for 1 night, stayed--his words--in a nice hotel and then came back to Minnesota, and--magic--he was legal. He served under General MacArthur in the He then came back to the United States, met his wife, got married, and had kids. His son served in the Vietnam war.  I had the privilege of hosting him at the World War II Memorial, which he had never seen before--with his son, who is a Vietnam vet--so that he could see the memorial for the first and the last time. With us were two Dreamers from high schools in the suburban Twin Cities area who wanted to serve in the Air Force but couldn't because we don't have the same rules we had during World War It was, basically, because of their statuses that they couldn't serve.  We lost Joseph Medina--the advocate that he was not only in words but by example--just last month. I think of his service, and when I see him standing in front of that memorial with those two Dreamers who weren't themselves allowed to serve, it really hits home to me and to everyone who has heard his story as to what these Dreamers are all about.  We all have our stories, and we owe it to these Dreamers and we owe it to our country and the values of our country to stand up for these I stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have spoken out in support of the Dream Act and who agree that we must take action in the Senate to protect these Dreamers in the name of Joseph Medina and in the name of all of our relatives who have always come from somewhere.

1033,topic-id,426,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am taking this opportunity to speak on an important initiative to strengthen our aerospace workforce. H.4254, the Women in Aerospace Education Act, directs the National Science Foundation through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and NASA, to shape their fellowship and internship opportunities to encourage more women to get aerospace expertise while they are training to be teachers.  Female aerospace professionals must be placed in the classroom in greater numbers. A full fifth of U.aerospace engineers are of retirement age today. They are beginning to exit our workforce, which will create an enormous shortfall in our national security preparedness.  Meanwhile, women represent only one-quarter of all STEM workers and represent only about 15 percent of all aerospace engineers. We need to improve our STEM education pipeline--from ensuring STEM classes are available to students at a young age to encouraging young Americans to pursue STEM education all the way through to completing their degree.  But the gender gap that is so prevalent in this industry will persist until we make STEM and aerospace more inclusive of women and encourage women at a young age to pursue these fields.  Attitudes about career paths are formed at a very young age. The role models and leaders from which young women learn have an enormous impact on the decisions they make throughout their formal education as they enter the workforce.  I introduced the Women in Aerospace Education Act to make better use of some of the Federal Government's best teacher training programs to increase the number of women teachers who have seen, worked on, and can relate to the Nation's leading aerospace programs to young female students.  Robert Noyce scholars, who get teacher certification assistance from the National Science Foundation, are already, in small numbers, getting experience in NASA centers and the national labs.  Once they become certified and go teach in the K-12 system, they draw upon the work they did on major public initiatives in science and technology. Schools love having Noyce program teachers because their strong positive attitudes about STEM are cultivated in the students. It will strengthen our STEM pipeline to enhance the connection between the Noyce scholarship program and our schools.  The second provision of this bill directs NASA to more actively promote its internship and fellowship opportunities to women or members of other historically underrepresented groups.  Together, the two provisions of this bill will help a necessary and fundamental shift in our education system in aerospace workforce.

As the Congressman mentioned, my name is Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Congressman representing the great Eighth District of Illinois, which are the west and northwest suburbs of Chicago  I am proud to join my colleagues tonight in celebrating Illinois' bicentennial--the 200th year--of statehood. There is something special in celebrating the anniversary of Illinois' entry into the Union, as it was the State which produced the man who would save it.  I am proud to be from the Land of Lincoln, but for all of its national and historic importance, my love of our home State is also very personal. I did not have the honor of being born in Illinois, but it is my home and always will be because our State welcomed my family with open arms, as it has for so many others over the last 200 years.  You see, I was born in New Delhi, India, and when I was 3 months old, my parents brought our family to the United States so my father could continue his education and our family could embrace all the opportunities of this great country.  It wasn't easy and there was struggle, but my family came to know that the American Dream of building a better life was possible because the people of Illinois made it so.  We had our challenges, but everything changed for the better when my father was offered a position as an engineering professor in a mysterious place called Peoria, They did not know where Peoria, Illinois, was at the time. They unfurled the map, found out where Peoria was, packed the U-Haul in New York State, and started driving and driving and driving. They made it to Peoria, but that was when the golden years in our family started. That is where they educated their two sons in wonderful public schools. That is where they bought their first home. That is where they entered the middle class.  Every night, my father would say something at the dinner table along the lines of: Think of the greatness of this country and of Illinois, and make sure that the governments in both places are there for the next families who need it.  My father began teaching. My brother and I went to school in Peoria, and Peoria became our home. More than three decades have passed. My father is still teaching at Bradley University, and he and my mother still live in the house I grew up in.  Though I went away for college, I always knew where I would be when it was time to start my own family. My wife, Priya, and I were married in Illinois, and all three of our children are being raised there.

Gunnery Sergeant Basilone is an exemplar of brave service in our Armed Forces, and a member of the Greatest Generation, whose collective bravery and selflessness won World War II and liberated millions from oppression.  In Congress, there are many actions we take to honor and remember those who serve our These commendations matter. Younger generations ask whose name is inscribed on monuments and flag posts or on Federal properties; and in retelling these stories, we inspire young Americans to appreciate the generations that came before in public service.  Sergeant Basilone, indeed, has a tremendous story. Born on November 4, 1916, in Buffalo, New York, he was 1 of 10 siblings born to Salvatore and Dora His father, an immigrant from Italy, and his mother, a native of Manville, New Jersey, decided to raise their family in the Somerset County, New Jersey, Borough of  At just barely 18 years of age, a young Basilone decided to enlist in the United States Army in the 1930s. He would begin his military career with a tour of the  In the Army, he was popular, extremely well-liked. He boxed and contributed to a sense of camaraderie that put the young men who were a world away from home at ease. He would later be honorably discharged from the Army and return home.  But in 1940, the trumpet summoned him again, and he re-enlisted, this time in the He would be dispatched to the height of battle in the Pacific theater.  Sergeant Basilone and many fellow marines were part of Operation Watchtower to regain territory in Guadalcanal, the site of a Japanese airfield. On August 7, 1942, the group took the airfield and defended it bravely from Japanese attempts to reconquer the territory.  In October of 1942, the Japanese began another land attack to regain control of Sergeant Basilone fought bravely for 2 days and[[Page H9817]]ultimately contributed to the annihilation of a considerable portion of the Japanese regiment.  In a moment of selfless service to his fellow marines, Sergeant Basilone endured brutal enemy fire during the assault to assist nearby machine gunners in trouble.  Seeing the immediate danger, he killed eight encroaching Japanese soldiers and quickly provided aid and equipment to the pinned marines. He saved many lives that day and, in later testimony, his fellow marines credited Sergeant Basilone's gallantry and heroic conduct for saving their lives, actions that would earn him the Medal of Honor in recognition of his actions at                              {time}  1445  Sergeant Basilone would return home for a short time, selling war bonds to continue doing what he could for the country he loved and the work of which he was so proud.  However, staying stateside was not where he wanted to be. He volunteered to go back to the Before he left Camp Pendleton and returned to battle, he married Lena Mae Riggi on July 10, 1944.  One of Gunnery Sergeant Basilone's greatest traits was his tremendous regard for the safety of his fellow warriors. He could not let the narrow escape in Guadalcanal happen again, so he worked diligently to train recruits on proper machine-gun use. His trainees became known as the Basilone  One of his recruits, William Douglas Lansford, spoke of the pride and confidence Gunnery Sergeant Basilone instilled in him. ``We wanted to be just like him,'' Lansford was known to have said.  While he could have remained stateside at home with his new wife, he insisted on staying with the Basilone Gunnery Sergeant Basilone and his men stormed the shores of Iwo Jima with the first wave of marines on February 19, 1945.  The Japanese returned heavy fire. Sergeant Basilone ran toward one of the block houses, the source of Japanese fire, and quickly destroyed it with grenades and demolitions. After this, he scrambled to rescue an American tank that was trapped in a minefield.  But in a moment that will forever live in our hearts, Sergeant Basilone and a handful of his fellow marines were then hit by heavy mortar fire. He died alongside the brave men who stepped forward to serve this country and the men he wanted to return to battle to protect and defend.  Thanks to his bravery and his fellow marines, the Allied Forces were able to complete the invasion. He would be awarded, posthumously, the Navy Cross, the United States Navy's highest decoration, for his sacrifice and service on that fateful day, becoming the only marine in the war to receive both the Navy Cross and the Medal of  In the generations that have followed, Sergeant Basilone has rightfully taken his place as an American hero of the Second World Raritan has held a parade in his honor every His statue stands in the heart of the borough. His legacy of love and service to the country has been maintained by his extended family, such as his niece Kim Van Note, through the Basilone Kim joins us today in the House gallery.  Gunnery Sergeant Basilone, more than self, his country loved, and it is that great love of country and an American spirit I hope that inspires future generations for years--might I suggest, decades--to come. It is the least we can do in the House of Representatives to name Raritan's post office in his honor. I am honored to sponsor this legislation.

633,topic-id,1055,"Mr.President, those of us who remember the massacre at El Mozote, El Salvador, are reminded that last week was the 36th anniversary of that horrific tragedy.  For those who are not aware, on December 11, 1981, Salvadoran soldiers, including an elite battalion trained and equipped by the United States, systematically murdered more than 900 innocent men, women, and children. The Salvadoran military high command falsely denied the crimes had occurred, and their denials were echoed by the U.Embassy and the State For more than 35 years, the perpetrators of the massacre avoided justice, due to the cover-up and an amnesty law passed in 1993, but in 2016, the Salvadoran Supreme Court overturned that law and the case was reopened. Let us hope that those who ordered, participated in, and covered up those crimes against humanity will finally receive the punishment they deserve.  On December 2, good friend Congressman Jim McGovern traveled to El More than any other Member of Congress, Jim has been a tireless advocate for human rights and justice in that country. After returning to Washington, on December 11, Jim spoke about the El Mozote massacre in the House of I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [Five-Minute Special Order, Monday, December 11, 2017]               36th Anniversary of the El Mozote Massacre                      (By James McGovern (MA))       Mr.Speaker, thirty-six years ago, nearly one thousand men,      women and children were murdered by Salvadoran soldiers in El      Mozote, El It's considered one of the worst      massacres in modern Latin American history.       On December 2nd, I traveled to El Mozote with a delegation      led by the Washington Office on Latin Four hours      after leaving San Salvador, we arrived at El Mozote in the      northern region of Morazan, near the border of       Three decades ago, El Mozote included about 20 houses on      open ground around a square. Facing the square was a church      and, behind it, a small building known as ``the convent,''      used by the priest to change into his vestments when      celebrating Nearby was a small school house.       Our delegation sat in the town square with survivors and      victims of the massacre. We listened to their stories, shared      prayers for their loss and suffering, toured the grounds      where this atrocity took place, and visited memorials the      community built to commemorate and preserve this tragic      history. We also heard from lawyers with Cristosal, a U.S.-     based NGO providing legal aid to the association of victims      and survivors.       On December 10, 1981, the Salvadoran army brigade based in      San Miguel and the Atlacatl Battalion, an elite infantry unit      based in San Salvador, arrived in El Over the next      two days, these troops methodically and viciously murdered      the town's residents and those of nearby villages.       On the morning of December 11th, troops assembled the      people in the town square. They separated the men from the      women and children and locked them in separate groups in the      church, the convent, and various houses. According to eye-     witness accounts, they then interrogated, tortured, and      executed the men at several different sites.       Around noon, they began taking the women and girls in      groups, separating them from their children and machine-     gunning them after raping them. Many families were ordered to      remain in their homes while soldiers set fire to the houses.       Over 140 of the children, some mere infants, were jammed      into ``the convent'' next to the church. There, soldiers      blocked the doors, aimed guns through the windows, and fired      into the mass of children, murdering them all in cold blood.      They then threw an incendiary bomb into the building,      collapsing the roof and adobe walls.       I walked with members of the community to the site where      the children were murdered. A garden cultivated in their      memory blooms on the site where they perished. A mural on the      side of the church facing the garden depicts tiny angels      ascending to heaven.       Beneath the mural are plaques with the names and ages of      the children killed so brutally. They range from zero to      sixteen years. Walking on such hallowed ground, I was deeply      moved and outraged by the atrocity that took place there.       In October 1990, the Salvadoran courts opened an      investigation into the El Mozote[[Page S8044]]     case, and in January 1992, the civil war ended with peace      accords signed between the Salvadoran government and FMLN      guerrillas. In November 1992, the U.Truth Commission on El      Salvador supervised exhumations of El Mozote remains by      Argentine forensics experts, confirming that the stories told      by survivors were indeed true. Then, everything was cut short      when the Salvadoran congress passed a sweeping amnesty law in      1993.       However, last year, in July 2016, the Salvadoran Supreme      Court overturned the amnesty law as unconstitutional. And in      October 2016, a judge reopened the El Mozote case and began      taking testimony, which continues today.       There are many reasons why we in Congress should be engaged      in the search for justice in the El Mozote case.       First, in the post-war period, the U.has supported a      strong and independent judiciary in El Salvador, capable of      prosecuting corruption and human rights abuses. El Mozote is      viewed as an exemplar case on whether this is possible to      achieve.       Second, in the 1980s, the United States armed, trained and      equipped the Salvadoran armed forces, in particular, the      At El Mozote, U.guns and bullets were used to      massacre infants, children, women and men.       Third, the U.established and trained the Atlacatl      Ostensibly an elite rapid reaction counter-     insurgency force, it was a major actor in the mass murder at      El Mozote; nine years later, the unit also murdered six      Jesuit priests and two women at the University of Central      America in San       Finally, at the time of the massacre, the Salvadoran High      Command denied that it had happened. The U.embassy and      State Department echoed those denials and denigrated the      Washington Post and New York Times reporters who traveled to      El Mozote and published detailed stories about the massacre.       Mr.Speaker, the U.should support the Salvadoran judge      presiding over the El Mozote case and the Attorney General's      Office, including releasing all information in our military      and intelligence files relevant to that period of the civil      war.

704,topic-id,1150,"Madam President, this week, the Federal Communications Commission--FCC--is preparing to give a giant, early Christmas present to a few, deep-pocketed telecom companies, as it prepares to repeal critical net neutrality protections. Net neutrality is the simple principle that the internet should be kept free and open by preventing the corporations who control the connections to selectively throttle or block certain content, especially that of competitors.  Repealing net neutrality rules will benefit just a few powerful corporations--and it will do so at the expense of small businesses, consumers, and hard-working Americans, whose persistent and passionate voices on this issue have been completely ignored by the FCC's Republican majority.  Despite calling for public hearings when the current net neutrality protections were developed, Chairman Pai has failed to heed his own advice now that he is in charge of the  It seems the only people he listens to are those with deep enough pockets to afford high-powered lobbyists. If you are a concerned citizen or small business owner, your voice doesn't matter to this As someone who held public hearings on this issue in 2014, I can tell you that there is widespread and overwhelming support for net neutrality just about everywhere except at the FCC itself.  If the Chairman took the time to listen, as I did, he would hear from small business owners like Cabot Orton at the Vermont Country Store, who told me, ``We're not asking for special treatment, incentives, or subsidies. All the small business community asks is simply to preserve and protect Internet commerce as it exists today, which has served all businesses remarkably well.''  Just today, we received a letter from businesses in Northern New England, including Vermont's own Ben & Jerry's, Cabot Creamery Cooperative, and King Arthur Flour, discussing the[[Page S7985]]``crippling effect'' a repeal of net neutrality rules would have on rural businesses.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Chairman Pai would hear from libraries, which for some rural communities are the only way to access the internet.  As Vermont's State librarian, Martha Reid, told me: ``All Americans--including the most disenfranchised citizens, those who would have no way to access the Internet without the library--need to be able to use Internet resources on an equal footing.''  Chairman Pai would also hear from independent content creators whose voices are too often not heard on traditional media. As actress, writer, and producer Ruth Livier told me: ``In the unprecedented world of an open, nondiscriminatory Internet, no longer did low-budgets and no connections mean there was no way in. Never again could we be disregarded by anyone who essentially asks, `Who are you to have your story be told?' ''  These are the voices being ignored. They are the people, the Americans, who stand to lose the most in the Chairman Pai's misguided plan.  This is not about partisanship. Republicans and Democrats alike, in my State and every other State, benefit from the power of an open Internet, and equally stand to be harmed if the rules of the road ensuring its openness go away.  I know there are some people with a lot of money who want to do away with net neutrality. They are even filing fake comments with the FCC saying they want to repeal these protections. One of those comments came to my attention. It had my name and my home address on it. Most people, when they saw it, just laughed, because they knew it was fake.  None of us should support a process that willfully dismisses the voices of our constituents. I hope that all Senators will join me in calling on the FCC to abandon this reckless vote to repeal net neutrality.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                December 13, 2017.     The Ajit Pai,     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington,       Dear FCC Chairman Ajit Pai: We are a group of businesses      from Northern New England with strong ties to the rural and      agricultural business community. We are writing today out of      deep concern about the FCC's proposal to roll back the      current net neutrality rules based on Title II of the      Communications We urge you to maintain the existing      rules instead.       As members of the business community in this region, we      regularly witness how small rural businesses, including the      farms and cooperatives that many of us source from, already      struggle with limited access to broadband and limited options      for Internet service providers. The repeal of net neutrality      would compound the challenges faced by these businesses,      adding cost and creating a competitive disadvantage to      running a successful business in rural       Uninhibited access to the internet is already a fundamental      necessity for operating a successful business in rural areas.      Looking to the future, this is only going to become more      important. In our work with farmers in this region, we see      how this particular group of businesses is increasingly      reliant on the internet for access to technical information      and support, and for access to information about markets.       The changes proposed by the FCC would remove the only      existing legal foundation strong enough to ensure net      neutrality protections are enforceable: Title II of the      Communications Act, as implemented in the agency's 2015 Open      Internet       Under this change, internet providers would gain new powers      to steer businesses and customers one way or another. For      example, Internet access providers could charge new fees for      prioritized access to customers. While big companies and      farms might be able to afford a pay-to-play prioritized `fast      lane' to users, small and medium sized businesses cannot; at      the very least, such new fees would put them at a distinct      disadvantage with larger competitors. Internet access      providers could also charge rural businesses new fees for      access to websites and services. They could favor certain      businesses by slowing down traffic or exempting competitors'      traffic from users' data caps. They could also block websites      and apps outright. This would create immense uncertainty for      companies in every sector of the economy who rely on open,      unencumbered connectivity as a key enabler for their business      and productivity. It could also greatly limit or bias      farmers' access to products, services, and information they      need to run their business.       Ultimately, repealing net neutrality will have a crippling      effect on rural economies, further restricting access to the      internet for rural businesses at a point in time where we      need to expand and speed this access instead. We urge you to      maintain strong net neutrality rules and focus on advancing      policies that foster fair competition.

1054,topic-id,1607,"Mr.President, I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut for his words. The Senator from Connecticut is a former prosecutor who knows law enforcement backward and forward. I can only imagine the grief felt in his As a neighboring New England State, I recall the vigils, the[[Page S8022]]people coming to pray, and the sadness from what happened in our neighboring State of But as so many have said, we can express grief--and we should--but we have to do what the Senator from Connecticut and others have suggested, which is actually take some steps that might stop these things. So I applaud him for what he said.  Let me speak on another issue. This week, we voted on three circuit court nominees, just one step below the Supreme All three of these nominees are extreme. One is objectively unqualified. The fact that we are so quickly casting floor votes on these troubling nominations, all of whom were reported out of the Judiciary Committee just last week, is a symptom of the Republicans' willingness to abandon decades of Senate tradition so that this body can serve as a rubberstamp for President Trump's nominees. The Senate will not be the conscience of the Nation or the check and balance it was always designed to be, but instead, a rubberstamp for the  Let me just cover a couple of things. Don Willett is a sitting justice on the Texas Supreme That should mean something. Sitting judges have an obligation to exercise good judgment; to not say anything that would lead individuals to question their impartiality. A question I ask nominees all the time is: Can someone who comes into your court--whether they are Republican or Democrat, plaintiff, defendant, rich, poor, whatever--look at you and say: Well, at least this judge is going to show impartiality. Maybe I will win or maybe I will lose, but it will not be because the judge wasn't impartial. When you look at this sitting justice, Don Willett, he fails the standard of impartiality.  A few weeks ago, I questioned him about his tweet telling a young transgender woman, who was interested in playing softball to ``Go away, A-Rod.'' Justice Willett claimed that this tweet was in jest. But, let me say it again--a sitting justice telling a transgender teen to ``go away'' sends an unmistakable message to marginalized, vulnerable communities: Not all are welcome in my courtroom. Well, that is not a laughing matter.  This was not the first time that Justice Willett has worn his bias on his sleeve. As an aide to George Bush while he was Governor of Texas, he objected to then-Governor Bush declaring a ``Business Women's Week.'' He opposed the proclamation's mention of ``glass ceilings, pay equity . . . [and] sexual discrimination/harassment.'' He dismissed these very real barriers to women in the workforce as ``hype.'' For these and other reasons, I seriously question his judgment or that he would be seen by people coming into his courtroom as impartial.  Then we have James Ho, who is another troubling nominee. His views on social issues are, not surprisingly, extreme. He has even offered effusive praise for Jeff Mateer, another Trump nominee who has publicly proclaimed that transgender children are part of ``Satan's plan.'' Even as a judge, he has complained about the Supreme Remember, these judges are supposed to follow the precedent of the Supreme He has complained about the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision. He said that it is going to lead to ``people marrying their pets.'' I don't think any legal scholar anywhere from the right to the left would agree with that interpretation. Mr.Ho praised Mateer for ``protecting and enforcing the . . . civil liberties of every Texan.'' Well, it is not every Texan--just those he agrees with.  Of course, this race to confirm Mr.Ho that is zipping through here means that we will not have fully vetted him for this lifetime appointment. When he served in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, he authored a memorandum that was cited in one of the shameful ``torture memos.'' These torture memos have turned out to be a blot on the conscience of the United Mr.Ho has refused to answer questions about his involvement, despite the fact that the torture memos are now very much in the public domain. Unfortunately, these kinds of non-answers are considered sufficient as of late, since Republicans are more interested in rubberstamping President Trump's judicial nominees than asking serious questions of them as a coequal branch of government. I cannot believe that any Republican leadership would allow a nominee of a Democrat who would have been involved in the drafting of a key and controversial memorandum to be confirmed unless they are willing to answer questions about it.  Then we have Steven Grasz, whom the American Bar Association unanimously rated him as unqualified for the Federal bench. In the past 40 years, I recall seeing a unanimously unqualified rating only a few times, and those people never made it through. After an exhaustive review including more than 200 interviews about Mr.Grasz, the ABA concluded he could not separate his personal beliefs from his duties as a judge--a fundamental obligation of a judge. This is almost unprecedented to have a rating like this.  To have at least a qualified rating from the ABA is a basic qualification for a nominee to the Federal bench. Certainly, Republicans would insist on it if it was a Democrat's nominee. The Republicans made it very clear that if a Democrat nominated somebody who got a ``not qualified'' rating--I don't recall it happening, but if they did--they made it very clear that person would never be considered. Well, here is somebody who is declared ``not qualified,'' and yet they whipped him through. You would think ``qualified'' would at least be the bottom line for a nomination. You would think whoever is President, they are at least nominating somebody who could hit the threshold of being considered qualified.  Republicans are now casting aside the ABA as a biased institution; some have accused the ABA of opposing Mr.Grasz simply because of his opposition to abortion. Well, that is absurd. The ABA has rated 46 of President Trump's 50 nominees as ``qualified.'' Let's not delude ourselves, does anyone think that any of the 46 Trump nominees that the ABA rated as qualified support abortion rights? They would never get out of the White House if they did. So that argument--like so many others used to support these extreme nominees--does not pass the laugh test.  As the longest serving member of the United States Senate and a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have spoken up about the steady erosion of the Committee's norms and traditions. The Committee has processed un-vetted, extreme nominees at an unprecedented rate. President Trump will have four times as many circuit court nominees confirmed in his first year than did President The reason President Trump has four times as many circuit court nominees confirmed in his first year than did President Obama is because Republicans removed any and all guardrails on our confirmation process--the guardrails they insisted on when there was a Democratic No matter how careful the Democratic President was in picking that person, they had to have these guardrails. I thought, actually, the guardrails made sense.  The second you have a President who nominates extreme judges, they decided we don't need those guardrails anymore because President Trump would never make a mistake. Nominees have had hearings scheduled before we even had the ABA ratings. Multiple circuit court nominees are regularly stacked on single panels. That is something Republicans insisted should not be done when there was a Democratic Now, unfortunately, the chairman--who is a friend of mine and a man I respect--has reversed his own blue-slip policy. He has begun to advance nominees without favorable blue strips from both home State That is the first time this has been done in the last two  I fear we are doing lasting damage to our nomination process. I fear we are making the advice and consent process a completely laughable exercise. The three nominees who are set forth this week are evidence of that.  I am going to vote no on each of them because they are not qualified. I have voted for many Republican nominees. I might disagree with them philosophically, but they were qualified, just as I voted for many Democratic nominees. Some I disagreed with, but they were qualified. These nominees aren't qualified. They are extreme. I want the standard I always asked for; that whoever you are, when you come into a courtroom, you can look at the[[Page S8023]]judge and say: OK, whether I am a plaintiff or defendant, rich or poor, facing the State as the respondent, no matter my political background, I am going to be treated fairly. I will win or lose my case on the merits, not on the judge's bias.  We are closing our door to that. We are closing our door to it when the President of the United States turns the selection process over to an extreme political, partisan group and then asks Republicans to rubberstamp it. I respect my Republican colleagues, but I can't imagine many of them ever standing for a Democratic President doing anything like this. I wouldn't.

Congress needs to do something to stop this epidemic of gun violence that is destroying so many communities all around the country. On an average day, 93 innocent lives in America are cut short, due to gun violence. These senseless deaths also disproportionately impact communities of color.  As a Representative from California's 13th Congressional District, I know all too well the devastating impact that gun violence has on our communities.  In fact, the Center for Disease Control recently reported that African-American children have the highest rates of firearm mortality overall. They are about 10 times more likely than White children to be killed by guns. Latino children are twice as likely as White children to be killed by guns. But no child--and I mean no child--regardless of their background, wealth, ZIP Code, or race, should be killed by gun violence. No child. It pains me, and I know it pains their parents and family members, to know that such promising young people have left us too soon.  Tonight, let me just read the names of a few of Oakland's children who have lost their lives to gun violence this year:  Anibal Andres Ramirez, who was only 13. He was Oakland's youngest gun victim this year. He was shot outside the new Walnut Plaza community center in east  Luis Urquidez, who was 17 when his friend accidentally shot him. What in the world was that gun doing around this young boy?  Deangelo Hal, who was 17 when he, once again, accidentally shot himself with a stolen gun.  Keith Lawrence, who was 17 and a student at Skyline High Keith was found shot dead in a parking lot.  Soane Mausia, who was 18 when he and his brother were shot by men outside of their east Oakland home.  Joaquin Byrd, who was 18 and also a student at Skyline High He was shot during a fight at a fast food restaurant.  Sultan Bey, who was 18. He was college-bound and had dreams of becoming a computer engineer. He was shot while picking up a friend.  Mr.Speaker, this only happens in There are too many guns in At some point, we have to stand up and say: Enough is enough.

934,topic-id,1526,"Mr.President, earlier today, the FCC voted to reverse a major impediment to a free and open internet--the title II internet regulations that were imposed under President Obama in 2015. These regulations are commonly referred to as net neutrality. For the sake of convenience, that is what I will call it.  I want to congratulate FCC Chairman Ajit Pai for his brave accomplishment today. He has fought for what he knows is right, and he has done so in the face of tremendous pressure and, at times, overwhelming opposition. I also want to use this opportunity to correct the record about what it is that the FCC has actually accomplished.  There is an astonishing amount of misinformation about this issue, and there is a lot of hyperbole surrounding it. If you believe the passionate voices defending these regulations, then you may believe that the FCC just jeopardized the entire internet as we know and love it and sometimes loathe it. These activists tend to paint a scary vision of America without net neutrality--a vision in which large internet service providers prey on ordinary consumers and startup businesses, a vision in which internet access would be rationed or bundled up in very expensive, unaffordable packages. One viral tweet even suggested that Google would start charging two bucks apiece for internet searches.  These are falsehoods, every one of them, and they will be exposed as such in the coming days, weeks, and months, when the internet hums right along just like usual and skyscrapers in all of our major cities remain standing. In the wake of that, we are going to look back at these dire predictions, these mere hysterics, like the Y2K bug or the Mayan apocalypse of 2012. In the present, these exaggerations have real-world consequences that go far above and beyond scaring the public.  In the last 6 months, Chairman Pai and his family have been attacked in the grossest and most unacceptable terms. Even his children have been singled out for intimidation. These kinds of attacks have absolutely no place in our public discourse. Why don't we tone down the rhetoric and see if we can get to the truth about net neutrality. We can start with a little background.  In 2015, the Democratic-controlled FCC issued the so-called open internet order. This order made dramatic changes to how the internet is classified for purposes of Federal regulation.  Until 2015, broadband internet was classified as an information service. As such, it was subject to light-touch regulations that allowed innovators to build without seeking permission from the Federal This classification reflected common sense, and it reflected the intent of  The internet is a fast-moving information superhighway. If slow-moving government regulators had gotten involved decades ago, it could have inhibited innovation--the same kind of innovation that keeps service fast and keeps prices low for all  Not only was this a commonsense arrangement, it facilitated a virtual renaissance of innovation and discovery in this increasingly important part of our economy. This renaissance gave us things like smartphones, ridesharing, and super-fast fiberoptic internet services. It gave us 3G, 4G, and then, soon, 5G wireless service. This period also gave us One could argue that maybe this wasn't all good but mostly good.  Overall, the light-touch regulatory arrangement works pretty well for ordinary users, big companies, and entrepreneurs who are just starting out in their garages. Contrary to net neutrality's most aggressive defenders, the internet of 2014 was not some sort of hopeless hellscape; it was actually pretty awesome.  The FCC threatened all of that in the early weeks of 2015 when it reclassified broadband internet as a ``telecommunications service.'' This innocuous-sounding change subjected the internet to a whole host of regulations that were originally meant for New Deal-era telephone monopolies like Ma In essence, the government imposed 1930s-style regulations on 21st-century technology. This outdated arrangement has worked about as well as one might expect. Broadband internet investment has fallen significantly since the net neutrality regulations were proposed in 2011. George Ford of the Phoenix Center estimates that between 2011 and 2015, just the threat of internet regulation scared off $200 billion in investment.  Since the regulations were imposed in 2015, broadband internet investment has declined by 5.6 percent. That is billions of lost dollars over just 2 years. As Chairman Pai has noted, this is the first ever decline in broadband investment outside of a recession, and this recession just happens to be self-imposed. It may not seem like a big deal to you that government is squeezing out billions in internet investment, but it hurts you and it hurts your fellow citizens in material ways, in ways that might not always be obvious. Less investment means less fiber optic cable, fewer towers, and fewer wi-fi hotspots. This translates into spottier coverage and slower speeds for Americans, especially those living on the periphery of[[Page S8034]]society, in poverty, or in rural areas. FCC regulations make it harder for these Americans to have equal access to the internet.  These regulations have also entrenched the market power of large internet service providers while hurting their smaller competitors. By their very nature, regulations impose conformity on a market. They limit companies' ability to distinguish themselves from their rivals by offering innovative services. This works out fine for the companies at the top. They have already made it. In fact, it can work out really well for some of them. They can kick back without worrying about some young punk coming along and changing the game. It works out less well for the young punks, the startups who want to win customers away from old-school companies.  That is how it works in theory, at least, and there is good evidence that this is exactly what is happening in practice. Small ISPs have been far more critical of net neutrality regulations than large A group of two dozen small internet providers recently wrote that the regulations hang like a black cloud over their business, slowing or even halting their deployment of new technology. Likewise, 19 municipal internet providers told the FCC that they ``often delay or hold off'' on introducing new services because they cannot afford a potential complaint. Internet providers that serve predominantly rural areas have voiced similar concerns, reporting that they have reduced network expansion in parts of the country that are already underserved.  These examples show that net neutrality regulations are harming competition and increasing the consolidation of power in the internet industry, not decreasing it. Internet regulations have, in effect, sheltered large ISPs from competition and from the need to change. Be sure to think about that the next time you are on hold with customer support.  As Americans chart a path forward in the coming years, we will face an important choice: Do we want an internet that is run by regulators or do we want an internet that is run by innovators? The innovators have had a really strong track record over the last 30 years with regard to the internet. So they are the ones I am siding with, not with the regulators.  How can we empower the innovators? More importantly, how can we empower the millions of families who rely on fast and reliable internet service each and every day?  The FCC did its part by repealing net neutrality regulations and returning to the regulatory framework that governed the internet--successfully, I would add--until 2015. This move reclassifies the internet as an information service, but it goes well beyond that. The FCC will require every ISP to disclose information about its network management practices. If these companies block or throttle web traffic, rest assured that the public will know about it.  Importantly, this order restores enforcement power to the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices. The FTC had policed the internet successfully for years prior to 2015. Now the cop is back on the beat. The FCC's action today is a return to normalcy for the internet, but we should not rest easy. A future administration could undo all of Chairman Pai's hard work at a moment's notice if Congress doesn't act to solidify his accomplishment.  Over the summer, I introduced legislation entitled the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would prohibit the FCC from imposing utility-style regulations on the internet ever again. Passing this act would give companies the regulatory certainty they need to invest in improvements for their customers. We should not discount how important Congress can be in determining the success or in directing the failure of things like the internet.  In 1996 President Clinton and Congress inaugurated the light-touch regulations of the internet. They wanted the information superhighway to be unfettered by Federal or State regulations. They were rewarded--and we were rewarded--with a tremendous outpouring of innovation that has improved the lives of, basically, all Americans and people throughout the world. I say that we emulate their wise example and see what free men and free women can invent in the next 20 years.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

That same report ranked Iowa 10th in available energy capacity in the United States if these nonpowered dams were converted, with the potential to generate 427 megawatts.                              {time}  1400  Renewable energy development like hydropower has created thousands of good-paying jobs across My district is the home of three hydroelectric generation plants and will soon be the home of the second largest hydro plant in the State, the Red Rock Hydroelectric Upon completion, Red Rock will produce upwards of 36 megawatts of energy.

217,topic-id,860,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to just take a moment and recognize another anniversary. Six months ago today, on a baseball field just a few miles from here, I and several of our colleagues found ourselves in a combat zone of our own.  It doesn't seem like it has been 6 whole months since a crazed gunman walked onto our field and started shooting at us. But the reason I want to bring that up today is because every person on that field that day who was shot at is still in this House today and still walking around in Washington, D. By the grace of God, we were protected during that time, and I just want to thank everyone for their prayers and support, and those who responded to that event and came out and saved the lives of many of us.  Steve Scalise, the whip whom we serve with here; Matt Mika, one of our staff members; Zack Barth, a congressional staffer; and Capitol Police Special Agent Crystal Griner all were wounded during that battle, and it really was a battle.  But I also want to highlight some of those who did not leave the field that day, who stayed and helped others; people like my good friend from Mississippi, Congressman Trent Kelly, an Army Reservist, who, when he identified the shooter, did not panic, but he alerted others, and then eventually led many to safety behind a concrete building.  Representative Mo Brooks stayed and helped apply a tourniquet to Zack Barth who had been shot in the calf.  Representative Brad Wenstrup, who is also a colonel in the Army Reserves, a combat doctor, was out on the edge of the field and could have easily run away, but he stayed and was one of the first to be able to run out and give aid to Steve Scalise out on the field as he lay near second base.  Retired Lieutenant General Representative Jack Bergman was able to actually lead several of our players and staff members to safety inside of the dugout away from the gunfire.  Brian Kelly, a civilian staff member on the team, stayed with me throughout the gunfire as we tried to lend aid to Matt Mika who was lying next to the Capitol Police SUV throughout the entire incident.  Finally, my thanks go out to Special Agent David Bailey, who I personally watched on numerous occasions put his own life in danger as he would move out into the line of fire to draw fire away from myself and Brian He saw that, whenever the shooter was not shooting at Capitol Police, they were shooting at us so he would purposely move himself in the line of fire, and again, miraculously protected us, even as one of the rounds hit his cellphone which deflected away from his body.  Lastly, I want to thank the Alexandria Police Department, who came to our aid and eventually took down the shooter.  Moments like this are surreal to me and to others, and it is important that we go back and reflect and remember these moments. Because the only way that we can correct mistakes from our past, is if we go back and we relive them and we look at what caused this.  As we stand here today, one of the things that I see that we need in America that we have lost is the idea of civility. We have heard here on the floor[[Page H9936]]today differing opinions regarding policy; ideas of what is good for this country, what is right for this country. That is part of the strength of this country. That is the freedom that we have, which is to bring different ideas.  The whole idea of this Chamber is to bring different ideas and different policy opinions to the floor and debate them, and those ideas and opinions that have the support of a majority of the Members are moved forward.  But at some point in the past, we have transitioned beyond just arguing over ideas and we bring rhetoric that is distasteful. We attack the person and their families. I just believe that we can do a whole lot better in this Nation if we, once again, find the ability to agree to disagree and respect the rights, freedom, and the liberty of the other person to have their opinion. If we can do that, then we can engage in discourse and we will lessen the amount of violence that we see that is driven by political rhetoric.  That would be the message that I would pass off to America on the anniversary of the shooting because that is the idea that people like John Yates lived their lives for and fought their battles for, was for the freedom that we have in this Nation to continue to exist.

652,topic-id,810,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding time so that I can speak, and not just in support of this legislation, but in strong support of the legislation by my colleague and friend from Michigan (Mr.Trott).  In the short time I have been in Congress, Mr.Speaker, one thing I have come to realize, there are some people in this Chamber who never met a regulation that they didn't like. Regardless of how effective or ineffective or misguided that regulation is, or how outdated the regulation is, they always just want to hold on to a piece of government regulation.  I, too, appreciate the ranking member for going through the litany of mission statements of special interest groups here in Washington, D.But this is precisely what the American people are tired of. They are tired of the Washington, D.C., swamp. They are tired of the special interests, and they want legislation that affects them personally. This piece of legislation will affect millions of Americans directly.  Now, I am not just speaking today from prepared remarks, which I have, but I am speaking from someone with experience in this area. I spent 30 years, Mr.Speaker, in the IT services business. Ten of those years I spent protecting some of our Nation's secrets, through military intelligence, and then working in the defense industry. Twenty of those years I had my own business, and we were responsible for protecting the sensitive information of businesses and their customers. So I am well versed in the idea of protection, and, as a constitutional conservative, I am very sensitive to privacy protection.  This piece of legislation is commonsense legislation. It is exactly what the American people want us to pass, and I can give you some great examples of why, because one of the aspects of security, especially data security, is being continually aware of the threat.  Now, what happens--and I remember when this happened. I was still in my IT business when the original legislation was passed; and all of a sudden, I am receiving a privacy notice of what my rights are, and, unlike most Americans, I sat down and actually read all of it.  Now, where the confusion came in is when, a year later, I receive another one, and then I receive another one, and I am literally comparing the two to see what has changed, and I find out that nothing has changed.  So what was the reaction after that? Every time I get a notice in a big envelope, instead of just a bank statement, I would just take it and throw it in the trash, not knowing if something has actually changed, which would be important.  Now, Mr.Luetkemeyer, another colleague of mine on the Financial Services Committee, passed a bill 2 years ago to provide correction to that problem. All Mr.Trott's bill is doing now is expanding that to other industries.  This is a consumer protection bill because now, if someone in those industries, if there is a change, they receive a notice, they know that there has been a change.  But, as the chairman has pointed out time and time again, this is actually going to give more immediate access to know what the privacy policy is of financial institutions, to identify if there have been any changes because they can go online to see it. I mean, you can get that instantaneous with these devices that almost everyone carries. It is time to bring us up into the current century and the technology that we have.  So I commend my colleague on actually bringing commonsense legislation, the type of legislation that Americans want, that consumers want. They want to know what their rights are, but they don't want to be inundated with useless information continually, over and over again, because then they would actually not be aware of what their rights are and what has changed.  Now, this is especially beneficial to Georgia because Georgia has become an auto manufacturing hub. And as we continue to grow this economy, and more people--I believe in the next few days, when we pass this tax bill, you are going to see a rise in people buying automobiles. Why? Because they are going to have more money in their back pocket. They are going to spend more money, and they are going to be taking out more loans.  So we need to make sure that they know immediately what their privacy rights are, and this bill will make it to where those will be available online.[[Page H9912]]This simply makes--it right-sizes government by making government smarter, more effective, and, actually, that the regulation is tailored toward the consumer, not toward the special interest groups and the trial lawyers in Washington, D.

This bill will help do that by ensuring that community banks and credit unions stay in the mortgage lending business and continue to provide potential homeowners with diverse credit options in their communities.  I would like to thank Representative Claudia Tenney from New York for providing such a great relief to community institutions.  Unfortunately, as we have seen too often, this is one more instance where government efforts to protect people are inadvertently having the opposite effect. Though intended to protect homeowners, the CFPB's final rule and guidance on escrow and mortgage service requirements are so burdensome and costly for smaller institutions, that we are driving mortgage businesses away from them.  This comes on top of an already burdensome regulatory environment in which our small financial institutions are facing rules and regulations that were made for larger banks, causing them to close their doors at a rate of one small institution a day.  We need a more tailored regulatory environment that balances the credit needs of consumers with appropriate consumer protections. This legislation would do that by exempting lenders with assets of $20 billion or less from escrow requirements on high-priced mortgage loans they hold in portfolio and would provide much-needed regulatory relief for small servicers.  With smaller staff and fewer resources, existing escrow rules are financially and technically prohibitive for small community institutions. In addition, these smaller lenders often hold the liability in portfolio for the term of the loan, making an escrow account unnecessary, because the lender has a strong interest in protecting its collateral by ensuring that taxes and insurance premiums get paid.  When it comes to purchasing or refinancing a home, it is tremendously important that consumers have credit options. We preserve those options by allowing community institutions to enter or remain in the mortgage market.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

That bill was ultimately signed into law by President It has eliminated millions of confusing and often-ignored mailings that cost millions of dollars to produce each year.  While our legislation provided relief to banks and credit unions, it did not extend relief to other financial companies regulated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; namely, captive finance companies that operate in a manner largely similar to depository institutions.  The safeguards featured in the bill from the 114th Congress and codified into law are included in Mr.Trott's bill. This relief will not be granted to a financial company that has changed its policies or practices with regard to disclosure of nonpublic personal information; only if it kept it the same.  There is also a requirement that the privacy notice must be made available to consumers in a variety of ways. Consumers will continue to have access to privacy notices through online resources and billing statements.  Requirements for financial institutions to release annual privacy notices to customers, even when no changes have been made, are both redundant and a waste of resources. With the passage of this bill, information included in these mailings would likely be more significant to the consumer because they would only come after a change in privacy policy.  Mr.Speaker, this is about accountability for the institution to their customer for holding that information. It is about access for the customer to their own information, with regards to privacy of it. A good example, as pointed out by the ranking member, was But let's stop and talk about Equifax for a second.                              {time}  0945  What happened? They had, I believe, the largest breach in history, 150 million people.  Mr.Speaker, there is probably you and I and everybody in this room and probably the 12 people watching right[[Page H9910]]now who are affected by this, but I guarantee you that you and I and all in this room and the 12 people watching, nobody kept their privacy notices that were sent out last year, did we? They are all in file 13 somewhere, long forgotten, and all of the information in those privacy notices is forgotten about and not even probably read to begin with.  So it is important. The gentleman's bill here has in here that the privacy notice can be accessed online. And in the Equifax breach, anybody who was concerned could then go online and check for the privacy policies of Equifax and see what the policies were and whether they were adhered to by the company itself in notifying them, in taking care of their concerns, in reimbursing them. Whatever was in the notice was in that online notice as well. So it provided that access, which the consumer is not going to have in a piece of paper. That is probably going to get in file 13.  I can tell you, Mr.Speaker, when I was home last weekend, I got one of those things. You know what, I looked at it, opened the envelope, and said: ``I don't want to read this.'' I threw it away. This is nonsense. This is a waste of time and resources.  And, in this situation with the Equifax breach, I think this bill points out the great things that can happen if you enact this legislation from the standpoint of allowing consumers to have access, 24/7, to the notifications and the privacy policies.  Mr.Speaker, I want to again thank the gentleman from Michigan for picking up the mantle on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.2396. Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing the bill before us today.  ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgH9905-2.txt,1931,RUTLEDGE PEARSON POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,14.0,December
729,topic-id,1565,"Mr.President, all the nearly 50,000 children who are on West Virginia CHIP want this Christmas is to have their healthcare. That is not a lot to ask for from a child.  As a legislative body, we were elected to serve the needs of all of our constituents, and that includes protecting our most vulnerable--our children. How many times do you hear us give speeches, whether it is in this body or whether it is back home--it is all about our children. The future of our country is about our children. The future of our State is about our children. Our future generation--whatever we do, the promise of the world--is about our children. And all they are asking for is to have their healthcare.  It seems as though we are so consumed with partisan gridlock and posturing that we would allow the expiration of health insurance for children. It is almost unconscionable for us to be in this situation, and the children have no control of their own healthcare coverage, and their parents can't really afford basic healthcare. They are the working people who are above the poverty guidelines and doing everything they can to put bread on the table and take care of their families, and their children have no access to healthcare without  On September 30, Congress not only failed to reauthorize a bipartisan, noncontroversial program for children, we failed the 9 million children in this country who rely on the program to stay healthy. There are 9 million children who are depending on CHIP, the funding of CHIP, and the basic priorities we should have for our most vulnerable, and we have done nothing. Our 1 job as Senators, as parents, and as human beings is to care for and protect our children, but this body cannot even find the humanity to do that.  In West Virginia alone, almost 50,000 children use CHIP over the course of the year, and more than 20,000 children who are currently on the program are going to lose it in February when the money runs out. Through CHIP, these children have access to basic medical care, which includes prescriptions, immunizations, dental coverage, vision, and mental health coverage. For more than 2 months, their healthcare has been hanging in the balance because of the negligence of the body, our dysfunction, playing Democrat and Republican at a higher level of our party than our purpose of being here, which is to do our job.  Millions of families are in a state of uncertainty, worrying about how to pay for their child's basic healthcare needs or, for many families, lifesaving services. I believe it is our duty to ensure that our children are taken care of, for they are truly our country's future and legacy. I believe that no matter how much your family makes or where you come from, the most important thing you have is healthcare for your children so that they have a healthy start.  There are five promises every adult should make to a child. This was started under Colin Powell, the five promises.  The first one is, every child needs to have a loving, caring adult in their life; someone who they know unconditionally loves them, right, wrong, or indifferent. It is not always the biological parents or biological family. It could be a neighbor. It could be someone reaching out. It could be a church or service. It could be an afterschool program.  Second, every child must have a safe place. A safe place might not always be the home where they live.  Third, every child must have a healthy start. We talked about nutrition. We talked about healthcare. That is part of it. If we can't teach a child how to keep themselves healthy, how to take care of themselves nutritionally in all different ways, they are not going to grow up to be a productive adult. They will have health concerns. They will have health challenges. It is up to us to make sure they have that healthy start.[[Page S8002]]  Fourth, every child should have a livable skill. That means education. In this country, we make sure every child has free education, K-12, and we make sure there is assistance so they can go through a college program. If we can work with them and help them with financial literacy, they wouldn't be bound with so much debt. I think we can help in a lot of different ways.  The fifth promise is the hardest one to teach. It is the hardest one because this promise is that every child should grow up to be a loving, caring adult and give something back. If these children see that we don't care and that our priority is not healthcare and that having a healthy start in life is not one of our priorities, what are they going to do when it is their turn, when they become the responsible adults? What are they going to do? Are they going say: Well, you know, I don't know, we didn't have too good of an example because we saw all the bickering and fighting back and forth, politics trumping everything, so I guess maybe that is not a big priority for us.  I hope they have more discipline than we have had here. I hope they have more compassion, more empathy than we have shown. That is what I hope. I hope that we change our ways now and make sure our failure to come together stops and stops now and that we come together for the CHIP program and the healthcare for every child who depends on this for a healthy start in life.  That is why I stand before you today--to encourage my colleagues to come together and find a solution and protect healthcare for over 9 million children across this country. I have talked to families and children all across West Virginia who are at risk of losing their healthcare coverage.  For many families, CHIP is a temporary helping hand while they are down and out. It is a perfect example of how, in West Virginia and in America, we put out a hand to help those people in need. There is a difference between a handout and a hand-up. These people need a hand-up when they hit hard times.  I have a letter from a mother in West  I have encouraged the people of West Virginia to put a real family, a real face behind the challenges they have so that it is not just something we are speaking about in a political arena--it is basically something that happens in real life, and it is affecting people.  This letter comes from Annetta:       My name is Annetta, and I am the mother of a now 18-year-     old son named WVCHIP is important to me because when      Dalton was 15, it was discovered he had a pituitary brain      tumor as well as a condition known has Chiari malformation.      If you are not familiar, Chiari is a condition where the      brain protrudes out the back of the head, similar to a      herniated disc in the spine. Most times, Chiari requires      surgery to relieve pressure out of the head.       I had lost my health insurance at work and could not afford      to get a private insurance during this time. Thankfully I was      approved for His neurosurgeon nor his endocrinologist      ever had any issues accepting CHIP; they didn't have any      issues with authorizations for MRIs or bone scans, which he      had every few months.       I am very thankful to have had insurance like CHIP, and I      feel there are so many children like my precious son that      will suffer if the program ends. I feel some could be      detrimental to not only the children but also the parents who      are not eligible for Medicaid services. We live in a state      where jobs are not so plentiful and the ones we have pay much      less than other       I hope WVCHIP is saved.  This is a mother reaching out, saying that her son was saved because of She couldn't afford it. She was above the poverty guidelines. She was working and trying to make it, and someone told her it might be more advantageous to go on welfare. There is still an awful lot of pride and dignity in people's lives. They will fight for that dignity, and we ought to fight to give them assistance during the toughest times.  I am calling on my colleagues to right this wrong and to reauthorize CHIP before we leave for There are so many deadlines we are trying to make. I know the speed the tax bill is moving through is because it is a priority to get done before Even though we don't have a crisis, even though the stock market is doing greater than ever, even though unemployment is lower than ever, there is a timetable at warp speed that this is moving through. Yet we have not addressed what we need most, which is healthcare for our children. I don't know where the urgency is for tax reform that would trump the urgency and the need for healthcare for children.  With that, I urge all of my colleagues to please take a look at this, and let's correct this wrong and not go home for Christmas until all these children have healthcare.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgS7981-3.txt,1983,CONVERSE VETERANS POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,13.0,December

702,topic-id,1515,"Madam President, I thank all of my colleagues, led by Senator Cantwell, for joining me on the floor this afternoon.  We are speaking on behalf of millions of our constituents and of the tens of millions of Americans who support a free and open internet. I am proud to come to the floor to discuss an issue of national importance to both our economy and our democracy--net neutrality.  Now, a lot of people have recently stopped and asked me: What exactly is net neutrality?  The technical answer is that network neutrality, or net neutrality, is the principle that internet service providers--you know their names: Verizon, AT&T, Charter, Comcast--cannot discriminate against content providers, against websites. They are the people to whom you pay by check each month and who make sure that you have broadband service. You know who they are. The simpler explanation is this: No one owns the internet. Everyone can use the internet. Anyone can improve the internet.  Yet that will not be the case if the Trump administration and Ajit Pai, the Chairman, and Republicans have their way. They want to get rid of the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules so that the ISPs, the internet service providers, can indiscriminately charge more for internet fast lanes, slow down websites, block websites, make it harder--and, maybe, even impossible--for inventors, entrepreneurs, and small businesses--the lifeblood of the American economy--to connect to the internet.  That is why we are here this afternoon on the floor, and it is why supporters of a free and open internet are vigorously opposed to this politically craven attempt to weaken the principle of net neutrality that has allowed the internet to flourish.[[Page S7983]]  Tomorrow the Federal Communications Commission is voting on a proposal that will cut at the very heart of a free and open internet. They are voting to roll back net neutrality protections and send a love letter to the big broadband companies that stand to make huge profits without these rules.  So what are Chairman Pai and his broadband buddies really trying to do?  The first thing they will do is to gut the rule against blocking. What does that mean? It means that an internet service provider could block any website it wants. That includes a website of a competing service or a website with a contrary political view--whatever they want.  Second, Chairman Pai would gut the rule against throttling. What does that mean? It means that the internet service provider could slow down any website it wants.  Third, Chairman Pai would gut the rule that bans paid prioritization. What does that mean? It means that the internet service provider could charge websites for an internet fast lane, meaning that those websites could load more quickly, while the websites that could not afford the internet's ``E-ZPass'' would be stuck on a gravel path and take more time to load, frustrating consumers with long buffering times.  Fourth, Chairman Pai would gut the forward-looking general conduct rule. What does that mean? The general conduct rule protects consumers from harms such as data caps and other discriminatory behavior that ISPs will think of in the coming months or years ahead.  Fifth, Chairman Pai would create an unregulated interconnection market. What does that mean? It means that the Federal Communications Commission would lose authority to oversee places at which ISPs connect to the internet and extract fees.  Finally, Chairman Pai wants to prevent States and localities from adopting their own net neutrality protections.  What will be the replacement for these enforceable net neutrality rules today? What will replace them? Absolutely nothing. Chairman Pai will leave it to the internet service providers to, simply, regulate themselves in this unpoliced internet ``Wild West.''  Chairman Pai claims that the Federal Trade Commission--not the Federal Communications Commission, which is the Commission of expertise over telecommunications--somehow provides a sufficient backstop to bad behavior by the ISPs, but that is simply not true.  Under the Federal Trade Commission, the big broadband barons would establish their own net neutrality policies. That is like letting the bullies develop their own playground rules. If the ISP wants to block websites, slow down competitors' websites, and charge innovators and entrepreneurs to reach their customers, they will be free to do so. That is because the Federal Trade Commission can only step in if a broadband provider violates its own net neutrality policies--that is, the policy created by the broadband company itself. Yet, if an internet service provider has a written policy that charges websites for internet fast lanes, there is nothing the Federal Trade Commission can do about it.  That is ridiculous, and it is wrong. Allowing the broadband industry to set its own net neutrality protections is like letting the fox guard the henhouse.  OK, so the Federal Trade Commission oversight will not work. Chairman Pai claims that he has another solution. It is called transparency. He argues that, if ISPs are transparent about their net neutrality practices, consumers and businesses can simply choose to use a broadband provider with the net neutrality practices that best suit them. But what good is transparency when most Americans have little or no choice for high-speed broadband access?  Consider this that 62 percent of Americans have only one choice for high-speed, fixed broadband. That is right. Nearly two-thirds of the country have only one choice from whom they can purchase broadband. That means, if a household's only choice for high-speed broadband is not transparent about its plans to set up internet fast and slow lanes, the consumer has two choices--one, to accept the internet service provider's terms or, two, to live without the internet. That is a false choice. People do not want to live without the internet in the 21st century.  Chairman Pai claims that internet service providers actually support net neutrality but just not the open internet order under which we are living today. That is like saying that you support democracy but not the It is like saying that you like math but you hate numbers. It makes no sense.  The broadband barons have been fighting for years, both at the Federal Communications Commission and in the courts, to block net neutrality rules. It is crystal clear, and it has been for years. The broadband companies are deeply opposed to net neutrality because they want to drive up their profits by setting up internet fast and slow lanes and charge consumers more for less. It is a simple formula.  Chairman Pai also claims that broadband investment has been discouraged by the open internet order. That is false. Investment in our broadband infrastructure is stronger than ever, and with the deployment of 5G technologies on the horizon, we can expect this strong investment to continue. Broadband investment in the aggregate has increased in the 2 years since the FCC passed the open internet order. Beyond just measuring dollars spent, broadband speeds also increased after the 2015 order, meaning the ISPs have been improving the services they offer to their consumers. Consider this: In 2016 almost half of the venture capital funds invested in this country went toward internet-specific and software companies. That is $25 billion worth of investments.  We have hit the sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless technologies is high, job creation is high, and venture capital investment in online startups is high. Chairman Pai threatens to disrupt this appropriate balance and squash innovation online. It is clear that Americans do not want what the FCC is proposing. It seems as though the only supporter of this plan is the broadband industry.  If Chairman Pai and his Republican colleagues turn a deaf ear to millions of Americans standing up to net neutrality and approve their plan tomorrow, we will continue this fight elsewhere. When the Obama-era rules were challenged by the internet service providers in 2015, I led a congressional amicus brief with Congresswoman Eshoo in support of the rules. Congresswoman Eshoo and I plan to do it again this time and lead an amicus brief in defense of net neutrality. I also intend to file a Congressional Review Act, or CRA, resolution of disapproval with a number of my colleagues so that the U.Senate can vote to undo Chairman Pai's proposal and restore the 2015 open internet order.  The Trump administration is waging an all-out assault on our core protections: DACA, the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate accord, and the Clean Power Now Trump's Federal Communications Commission has put net neutrality in its sights.  For all of those who rely upon the free and open internet, whether it is for commerce, education, healthcare or entertainment, I urge you to join me in this fight to create a firestorm of opposition to this assault on net neutrality. This is a fundamental attack on the openness of the internet that must be beaten, and we must now form an army of ordinary Americans as the voices that will fight the special interests and lobbyists in this city who want to shut down net neutrality forever.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgS7981-3.txt,735,CONVERSE VETERANS POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,13.0,December

Of course, I am referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Mr.Speaker, as I travel my State of Kansas and across the country, people invariably share with me what they feel their priorities should be for this Federal  Number one, almost everyone will say within 5 or 10 minutes that they think national security is very, very important.  Next, people typically talk to me about how important they feel education is.  Thirdly, people will talk about how important they feel infrastructure is: roads, bridges, railroads, high speed internet, and those types of things.  Mr.Speaker, no matter what your priorities are as an American, none of those will happen unless we have a strong, healthy economy; and that is what I believe the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does. It helps to continue the strong economy that we have created.  Mr.Speaker, we are so fortunate this year. We are about to celebrate our third quarter in a row of GDP growth over 3 percent. It seems like just January and I was coming here as a rookie All the experts and all the press said this country will never see GDP growth again, yet we are about to have our third quarter in a row of it. It just amazes me to hear people continually tell me what we can and cannot do.  I took a second to look at that. Why do we have this strong economy? Why is GDP growth going so well?  I think it is very simple. We have rolled back regulations and slowed that down.  So many people I have talked to have been sitting on the sidelines for the last 8 years, waiting for some certainty. This new President has given them the certainty to invest in this economy. Now it is time to pass this tax reform bill and make this economy even stronger.  From day one, from the first day we got here, we talked about common visions and goals for what tax reform would look like.  Number one, we wanted to make sure that we gave relief to hardworking Americans so that they would be able to keep more of the money they have earned through their labors.  Number two, we wanted a simpler process.  Number three, we wanted to grow a healthier economy that would create more jobs and pay higher wages.  Mr.Speaker, I am so proud to be here this week and say that we have delivered for the American people.  Let's take a look at this bill.  Number one, it gives relief to hardworking In Kansas, with the House bill, the average hardworking couple with two children is going to keep $1,400 more of their money.  But as we continue this process, we tried to make each rendition of this bill better and better. Now, the average Kansas family will be able to keep up to $2,000 more of their hard-earned money.  But more than that, there are another 5 million Americans who will get another $2,000 bonus this next year. Those are the people who paid for the ObamaCare health insurance penalty that they refused to take because the insurance was not worth anything.  Many hardworking Americans will keep up to $4,000 more of their money.  Next, it is simpler. Ninety percent of Americans will be able to do their taxes on the back of a postcard.  Is that not simpler?  Of course, it is. I don't think anybody can argue those first two points.  Thirdly, the goal was to figure out how we grow the economy, how we grow jobs, how we increase wages for people. That is what we have done. We have lowered taxes on small businesses, which will be the main job creators of this economy. By lowering those taxes, they are going to invest more in their people, in labor, and in capital items. Those will all lead to growing this economy.  This is a very easy bill to support, Mr.I don't have a Ph.in[[Page H10148]]economy, but I come from the school of hard knocks and hard work. Having ran several companies myself, I think the job pattern that we have going on will keep growing.  We have a 16-year high in consumer confidence, a 16-year low in unemployment. That is mostly due to rolling back regulations. But as we go forward with this tax reform, we are going to grow more jobs and have more opportunities for  This is the start of a new year with the greatest tax reform, the most important legislation of the 21st century, and I am so proud to be part of this process.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-18-pt1-PgH10147-4.txt,99999999999999,EXTENDING AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT TELEWORK TRAVEL EXPENSES TEST PROGRAMS,2017.0,18.0,December

We have seen time and time again, over the course of the last few months, the President of the United States standing up for the powerful and trying to crush the people of the United States, trying to rip healthcare from 30 million Americans in order to give special benefits to the richest We have seen the President of the United States sign in the Oval Office a measure that would enable a powerful company, when in a dispute with a consumer, to choose the judge, to pay the judge, to promise a judge future business. What kind of fairness is that for an ordinary American up against a powerful company, where the powerful company gets to choose a judge? Yet my Republican colleagues voted overwhelmingly to crush the opportunity of an ordinary citizen versus a powerful company in a consumer dispute.  Then we have the tax bill. The tax bill says that if you earn less than $30,000, you get a tax increase, and if you are in the middle class, 87 million of you will get an increase in your taxes. And by the way, we are going to give several trillion dollars to the very richest Americans and the most powerful corporations. It is another example of a bank heist on the National Treasury--our Treasury--to deliver benefits to the best off, to the richest in  Oregon is about 1 percent of the national population. If you take 1 percent of $1 trillion, that is $10 billion. I can tell my colleagues what we can do for families in Oregon with $10 billion. We can invest in needed infrastructure to have a stronger economy and put a lot of people to work with living-wage jobs. We can add teachers to our public school classrooms so that our classrooms offer better opportunity for our children to learn and to thrive. We can make college more affordable. We can improve our community health clinics to make sure healthcare is available to all, which is so critical to quality of life. But no. My Republican colleagues say: Let's give this money to the richest Let's raid the National Treasury and enrich the best off among us.  That is because we have a fundamental cycle of corruption in campaigns that is enabling such a bizarrely inappropriate bill to ever get heard on the floor of the I say ``bizarrely inappropriate'' because our government wasn't founded to mimic the powerful kingdoms of Europe that govern by and for the richest. We had a vision of government of, by, and for the people.  Now we have this issue of net neutrality, and once again President Trump and the Republicans are weighing in to crush ordinary people in favor of powerful corporations. The internet has become essential to all of us in our daily lives. We consult it to find out where to go to a restaurant or what movies are playing. We check the internet to find out what the sports scores are and what is the latest news. We order our airline tickets. We do so many things on the internet during the course of our everyday lives. Yet here is President Trump saying: We want to take that level playing field of fairness for consumers across America and let some powerful companies decide who gets to provide information, which websites to allow to have information and which ones we are going to slow down, whom we are going to put in the fast lane and whom we are going to put in the slow lane.  The internet is so critical to the freedom of information. This is really an assault on freedom of information. It was James Madison who said that ``the advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.'' Yet my colleagues and President Trump want to give powerful companies the ability to control what information is shared in  Think of a highway. We have a highway and everyone gets to use it, and you can be in the slow lane if you choose because you want to save fuel, or you can get in the fast lane and pass somebody who is going more slowly. We don't have someone saying: Hey, we are only going to allow the richest Americans to drive in the fast lane. We are only going to allow the most powerful corporations to be in the fast lane. For the rest of you, you get to go to the slow lane. I don't care if there is a truck going 25 miles per hour, you are going to be stuck behind it unless you pay me a whole lot of money to get out of that lane.  The internet for the rich and powerful is wrong, and we have to stop it. If the Federal Communications Commission doesn't get the message this Thursday, we need to overturn their rule here on the floor of the  I get a chart each day showing me the calls from yesterday. Here I have a bar saying how many people called about net neutrality and which side of the issue they weighed in on. So 544 people called in favor of net neutrality, and according to this chart, zero people called in favor of powerful corporations instead controlling the internet. I have since been informed we did get 1 call, so let's make it 544 to 1 instead of 544 to zero. Have you ever seen an issue where you have that kind of ratio of ordinary people weighing in and saying: Don't let the powerful take over our internet. People want a level playing field for consumers, a level playing field for distributing knowledge, a level playing field for entrepreneurs so that the new startups can compete with the Googles and the Amazons of our country.  I ask you, if you had a choice between two websites last night to follow the election in Alabama and one was in the fast lane and could replenish its numbers instantly and one was going so slow that the numbers were going to take 5 minutes to get posted, which site would you have gone to? Of course you would have gone to the site that can update quickly. That is the point.  We shouldn't allow powerful companies to extort Americans over the information flowing through the internet. It is not fair to American citizens. It is not fair to American entrepreneurs. It is not fair to the distribution of knowledge. We must defeat it.

People in my district and across America await meaningful tax reform. Most Americans paid too much in taxes. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last year that Americans paid more money in taxes than they spent on food and clothing. It is no wonder that nearly 60 percent of Americans believe our current Tax Code is unfair--it is.  America's Tax Code is currently chock full of special interest deals, while families living paycheck to paycheck and job creators need lower and simpler taxes now.  Throughout this process, my approach has been to evaluate this tax legislation from one question: Will this improve the lives of the vast majority of the people in my district?  That answer is, absolutely, yes.  The Tax Foundation projects that the House plan will save the average family in Michigan about $2,200 a year. That is real money.

1050,topic-id,767,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to speak about business that is important to Kansas and important to the country but especially important to the providers of healthcare for children, the children, and their families who receive that coverage and care; that is, the Medicaid CHIP program. It was established in 1997.  I call to the attention of my colleagues the importance of us acting in the next several days in regard to the reauthorization extension of the CHIP program. It has helped provide coverage to children of low-income families in my State and those individuals who would otherwise be left without any insurance and most likely, in every case, the funds necessary to cover healthcare costs for the well-being of those young men and women.  This program is funded through a multiyear authorization that requires Congress to take action each time the program reaches the end of that authorization. The end of that authorization occurred on September 30, now several months ago. While I have been assured in my State that there are sufficient funds to get us through the end of the year, I am concerned. In fact, the belief is, we may have enough funds to pay for our insurance program through That certainly is probably not the case across the United States, and we need to act within a few short days. I hope this is an issue that is addressed, as the continuing resolution that funds the Federal Government expires on December 22. As we respond to that circumstance, we ought to respond to the expiration of the CHIP program that occurred on September 30.  Waiting to reauthorize that program has already created an unnecessary burden, but if we waited any longer, it would create even more unnecessary burdens for families of more than 9 million children who are currently receiving healthcare through that program.  Temporary funding measures have kept the program solvent since the program expired, but now is the time to act, to provide some certainty and make sure the funds continue to be available. In Kansas, it would leave about 79,000 children without coverage or other good options.  Many of our Nation's best children's hospitals serve a great deal of patients through that CHIP program. We are fortunate in our area to have Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, and those hospitals and other providers rely upon the CHIP program to pay their bills as well. With all the costs associated with healthcare and with the inability of people to pay, the burden then falls upon hospitals and others to figure out how they survive. In Kansas, almost every hospital--127 of them in our State--continues to hang on by a thread, and some may not survive. This is another opportunity for us to strengthen and provide certainty that a mechanism will be in place so that when they provide care to children of Medicaid families, they will be reimbursed. That benefits all of us in our healthcare delivery system and provides more stability and more certainty in these challenging times for healthcare providers across  I am happy the House of Representatives has passed reauthorization. They did their bill. It is now time for the Senate to act. The Finance Committee has taken its action, but this bill is still pending on the floor of the U.During this Christmas season, this holiday time, parents should not have to wonder what they will do in the absence of this insurance program that allows their children to receive routine care and, in many instances, lifesaving care.  Continuing to delay action on this bill is not in the best interest of the American people. It would be nice, it would be appreciated by Americans to see the U.Senate work on a program that has broad bipartisan support but still, for some reason, can't get it across the finish line. That finish line, I suppose, was September 30, but I would say that finish line is now the end of the year, and specifically December 22, with the CR expiring at that point in time. It is time for Congress to take action in that regard.  My plea on the Senate floor this morning is for the U.Senate to take legislative action and reauthorize this program, provide certainty, and care for our country's children who are, without this program, in significant jeopardy of having an absence of healthcare.  I appreciate the opportunity to address the U. I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1070,topic-id,1363,"Mr.President, I am on the floor this afternoon to mark 5 years since the unthinkable--since 20 6-year-olds and 7-year-olds and 6 of their educators were killed in an elementary school in It changed the town of It changed this country in the way that we think about gun violence. And it certainly changed me. I want to offer a few thoughts today as we once again memorialize those beautiful children whose lives were cut far, far too short.  It is easy to spend today--especially those of us who come from Connecticut, who are very intimately connected to the tragedy and to those families--drowning in sadness. There is really no way to conceive of what it is like as a parent to lose a child that young, in that manner, in 5 short minutes in a hail of bullets emanating from a tactical assault weapon. Twenty kids who had just walked into their classroom, bright and cheery, were gone.  It is easy to hang your head, thinking of all of the things that haven't happened. I have been down to this floor over 50 times, often at my wit's end, raising my voice at my colleagues in frustration at our quiet and unintentional endorsement of the slaughter that happens in this country because we haven't passed a single piece of legislation trying to make sense of our Nation's gun laws. In fact, to the extent we have made changes in gun laws, it has compounded the problem, not remedied it.  But I want to spend my brief time here today not focusing on the sadness of today--it is there; it is inescapable--and not focusing on what we haven't done but focusing on so many miracles, big ones and small ones, that have occurred in and around the lives of those who have been affected in Newtown, CT, over the last 5 years.  First, there are these individual miracles that have happened within these families. Again, very few people understand the kind of crippling pain that comes with this loss. While these families will never be the same, they have found ways to rebound. They have found ways to still capture joy in their lives. Some have added to their numbers by welcoming new children into their family since then. They have rediscovered passions. They have made sure that the surviving children--the siblings--have been able to live lives of optimism rather than live lives of perpetual fear.  I have gotten to know so many of these families. The parents and the kids are now close, personal friends of mine. Watching the rebirth of these families instills a sense of faith in the human spirit that is hard to explain. Those are small miracles, but they are important ones to remember on this 5-year anniversary.  The miracles also come in ways that lives have been changed and saved through the efforts that have sprung forth out of this tragedy. So many of the families joined together with their friends and started up small charitable organizations in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, trying to find a way to take the beauty of these kids and transfer it to others. They are almost too numerable to mention.  The Ana Grace Project gives out a scholarship every year at Western Connecticut State University for incoming freshmen who are interested in studying music because for her whole life, Ana Grace was surrounded by music.  The Vicki Soto Memorial Fund donates five books every year to every K-6 classroom in her hometown of She was one of the teachers--heroes of that day. Kids have the opportunity to read and to learn to love reading--which is what she taught to these kindergarten kids--because of her foundation.  The Charlotte Helen Bacon Foundation pays for therapy dogs for kids and families in need, reflecting Charlotte's love of dogs.  The Catherine Violet Hubbard Foundation opened an animal sanctuary on 32 acres in Newtown to help animals that had been rescued from abusive or neglectful environments because of Catherine's love of animals.  The list goes on and on. These are small, beautiful miracles that are happening all across Connecticut and all across the country in trying to honor the memory of these kids and their educators.  Then there are miracles that have happened in the context of public policy. A year ago this week, I sat at the White House with a few of the Sandy Hook parents, quietly in the back of an auditorium, as President Obama signed into law the 2016 Mental Health Reform Act, which would not have become law without the input and activism of the Sandy Hook parents and many other survivors of gun violence.  Our gun violence problem is not a mental health problem, per se. There is no inherent connection between mental illness and gun violence. But there is no mistaking that the shooter in Newtown--as has been the case in so many other of these mass slaughters--had deep mental health problems that went untreated. There have been public policy victories.  So today, on the 5-year anniversary, I hope that my friends here will celebrate these small but meaningful miracles that have happened over the last 5 years, and I hope that you will be reminded that we cannot take one day or one moment for granted. Those moms and dads who sent their kids to school that morning never imagined that would be the last time they would be able to interact with their children. So none of us should think that we will have another chance to say what we want to say to somebody we care about. None of us should think we can put off saying ``I love you'' for another moment. Those small things that we do for each other matter desperately.  I think about one story that I will leave you with from that morning. Daniel Barden is one of the young boys killed in that elementary school. His older brother went to school at a different time than he did. He would get up earlier and go down to the bus stop earlier than Daniel would, so they normally wouldn't really see each other in the morning. For some reason, the morning of the shooting at Sandy Hook, Daniel got up earlier than he normally did. He saw that his brother was at the end of the driveway waiting for the bus. He ran out of the house and down the driveway to say goodbye to his brother--goodbye for the day. It was just a small, tiny act of kindness that Daniel thought probably would be forgotten by his brother by the end of that day, but it has meant the world to that family, the idea that Daniel got the chance to walk down the driveway and say goodbye to his brother before he went to school that day and never came back.  Don't ever think you will have another chance to say what you want to say to a loved one, to someone who means something in your life.  A few months ago, one of the Sandy Hook parents arrived unexpectedly in my office. I got word from the front desk that she was there. She just wanted to stop in for a few minutes. I said: Of course, send her back. This mom had lost her child. I have come to know her very well. She burst into my office and she flung her arms around me and she whispered into my ear: Keep going. She unclasped her arms and looked at me and said: That is all I wanted to come and tell you. After a few pleasantries, she walked out the door.  Keep going. That is what Newtown has done over the last 5 years. That is what those families have found the courage to do over the last half a decade.  For those of us who believe the laws of this country must change in order to protect kids like those who lost their lives in Sandy Hook, it is what we do. As we mark 5 years since the violence at Sandy Hook Elementary School, we keep going.  I yield the floor.[[Page S8033]]    ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgS8017-6.txt,1837,FEDERALISM ISSUES,2017.0,14.0,December
835,topic-id,656,"Mr.President, as a U.Senator, one of the most important and consequential choices I make is whether or not to support a judicial nominee.  The men and women of the bench are often the final gatekeepers of our Nation's justice system--and the right kind of judge shows up to work every day to make the system work for every citizen, free from prejudice or bias.  With that principle in mind, I strongly oppose the three nominees for the circuit court whose nominations are before the U. While President Trump has the right to make nominations, Members of this Senate also have the right to reject those nominations.  It is clear, based on the records of the three nominees before us, that is exactly what Members of this Senate ought to do.  Vote no.

The first nominee this Senate should reject is Leonard Grasz, whom President Trump picked to serve on the Eighth Circuit Court of  Mr.Grasz is a notable nominee but for all the wrong reasons.  He is notable because his peers at the American Bar Association unanimously found Mr.Grasz ``not qualified''--just the third nominee in nearly 30 years to receive this distinction.  The ABA report shows his peers questioned whether Mr.Grasz could look past his ``deeply-held social agenda and political loyalty to be able to judge objectively, with compassion and without bias.  These are serious red flags--and it is unconscionable for any of my colleagues to turn a blind eye to relevant information regarding Mr.Grasz's ability to do his job fairly.  I am also disturbed by the willingness of several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to slander the nonpartisan ABA as some sort of liberal front group instead of evaluating its factual assessment.  The ABA has done this body a great service of neutral and fair evaluation over many decades, for which Members of the Senate should be grateful.

No person who compares the right of one person to marry the person they love to a ``right to marry bacon'' is fit to administer justice in this country.  President Trump's other nominee for the Fifth Circuit, James Ho, has a similarly disturbing track record on LGBTQ rights.  He has also called for eliminating all restrictions on campaign finance and is[[Page S7963]]an ardent defender of giving the executive branch even more power.  I can see why President Trump would want Mr.Ho on the court, but Mr.Ho's pattern of giving more leeway to the executive branch should be deeply concerning to everyone else.  In sum, the three nominees President Trump sent to this Senate for review fall far short of the standards this Senate should demand or that this country deserves.  I want to make clear that these nominees have a completely backward and harmful record on women's constitutionally protected reproductive rights--and would seek to undermine Roe v.  Stacking our courtrooms with judges who will bend to the will of one President's hateful, divisive agenda is wrong--and will not be forgotten.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a stand. Reject President Trump's politically driven attacks on women's health and rights. Reject efforts to chip away at fundamental rights and respect for the LGBTQ community, and reject his judicial nominees who will serve only to give him the green light to expand his own power.

I just want to say to the Senator from Maine that it is my hope, regarding the statements that have been made to the Senator, that these two pieces of legislation she referenced will be passed. I do believe the majority leader, Senator McConnell, will honor that with regard to the It is this Senator's concern that at the other end of the hall, in the House of Representatives, they may not honor that. I certainly hope the Senator feels like she has the statements of commitment by the leadership in the House of Representatives that they will do as Senator McConnell has indicated.  Madam President, I wish to talk about the tax bill. Needless to say, you are going to hear a different version from me than my good friend and the very distinguished Senator from Maine, because last Friday night we got the conference agreement on the tax bill. You can wonder why it was held until late Friday night, when nobody was paying attention to the details of the bill.  What is becoming increasingly clear is that this tax bill is not for ordinary folks. It is going to give a few nuggets to the middle class, but that is to mask the true intent. The real purpose of the bill is to give huge tax cuts to multinational corporations and to make it easier for them to shift jobs overseas. That is the bottom line.  Right now, under current law, corporations that send jobs overseas have to pay taxes on the money they bring back into the United States, but now, what this new GOP tax bill says is that corporations that send jobs overseas can bring that money back to United States tax-free. Once this bill passes, companies will come under increasing pressure to take advantage of the tax savings in the bill by sending their jobs overseas to low-wage countries--particularly those jobs that can't already be automated.  This is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. Instead of passing this version of the tax bill that will inevitably send American jobs overseas, we should be working on a bill that cuts taxes permanently for hard-working middle-class families.  Supporters of the bill will argue that a lower corporate rate will encourage companies to keep jobs here. They will argue that, rather than going to a country with a higher corporate rate, America's corporate rate will be lower. But that is ignoring the attraction that companies have to send jobs overseas, because of cheaper wages and lower environmental standards.  Take China has a corporate rate of 25 percent, except that they make exceptions for certain companies at 15 percent. So the 21 percent in this tax bill for corporations on income earned in the United States may still be higher than in China, and the pressure on corporations is to take it to a country that has lower environmental standards and lower wages.  I think our friends on the other side of the aisle know this is a head fake. We are not fooled by this. We know what you are trying to do with this bill. The more people learn about it, the worse it looks. That is why they waited until Friday night to let the spotlight shine on it--so that over the weekend people weren't paying a lot of attention.  There is a reason why my friends on the other side of the aisle are in such a rush to get this passed. It is because they want to get it enacted before all of the new loopholes and sweetheart deals for the special interests and the bottom line of encouraging jobs to go overseas are discovered. And, starting right now, it is going to be discovered.  It would be nice if our colleagues showed as much urgency for some of the other things we should be doing in the Senate, such as providing millions of kids with health insurance through the CHIP program or helping folks recover from the massive hurricanes this year, including the millions of people in Puerto Rico who are still without reliable electricity or drinking water. What about the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in the United States who are here in a deportable status? That is what we ought to be worrying about.  It has been over 3 months, going on 4 months, since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Puerto Rican island. It has been months since Harvey and Irma devastated farmers in Texas, Florida, and Puerto While the Congress has passed two disaster supplemental funding packages, neither of them has included any relief for Florida's agricultural community. They are hanging on by a thread. They can hardly make payroll. They are having to lay off people. They desperately need our help, which I hope we are going to address in this next disaster aid funding package.  Instead of spending all of our energy on cutting corporate taxes and making it easier to send American jobs overseas, we should be focused on reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, so that 9 million children across the country, including nearly 400,000 in Florida, can continue to have access to the health coverage they desperately need. Or we should be negotiating permanent protections for the Dreamers before they are kicked out of the only country they have ever known. Unfortunately, the only thing this Republican-led Senate seems to care about is helping out large multinational corporations.  The truth is, these multinational corporations are doing just fine.

The reports are, the Department of the Interior is preparing to unveil a new 5-year plan for offshore oil and gas drilling--one that would open up the entire Atlantic coast of the United States to drilling. This new 5-year plan, which would go into effect in 2019, would replace the current 5-year plan that was finalized just last year and doesn't expire until 2022.

Take, for example, all of this area off the east coast of There is a place called the Cape Canaveral Air Force There is a place called the Kennedy Space We are launching commercial and military rockets, and within another year and a half, we will be launching American rockets with American astronauts that will go, just like the space shuttle before them, to and from the International Space Station and will carry crews as well as the cargo they already carry.  When you are launching to the International Space Station or, in 2 years, when we launch the largest rocket ever from the Kennedy Space Center--the forerunner to the Mars Program, taking humans to Mars, or in the case of the new Mars rocket, called the SLS, the Space Launch System--where do you think it will drop its solid rocket boosters? It will drop them precisely out here, which is exactly why you cannot have oil rigs out here.  All of the commercial rockets that come out of Cape Canaveral right now put up a host of communications satellites; that is, a constellation of satellites. How do you think we get our pinpoint GPS here on Earth? Many of those rockets are coming right out of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and, increasingly, there is commercial activity at the Kennedy Space Center, which is collocated with the Cape Canaveral Air Force  What about all of those scientific satellites that are out there that give us precise measurements on what is happening to the climate so when we then track hurricanes, we know precisely and have such great success in predicting the path and the voracity of a hurricane? All of those rockets are coming out of Cape They have first stages, and when the first stages burn up, they have to fall someplace. You cannot have oil and gas production out here.  It would be the same off of Norfolk, They also have a launching point there for NASA--Wallops Yet, in the Norfolk area, all of the military does its training out in the Atlantic, and you are going to have a whole disruption.  Take, for example, all of the military assets--spy satellites--that go into orbit and are rocketed out of Cape Those first stages, when burned up, have to fall. That is why we have a location like the Cape Canaveral Air Force It launches from west to east in order to get that extra boost of the Earth's rotation and, therefore, needs less fuel to get into orbit.  This is a prime location. You cannot put oil and gas out here. You cannot have oil rigs off of Cape Canaveral, where all of these military, NASA, and commercial rockets are going, as well as governmental payloads that are not military.  We have heard the loud opposition from the Department of Defense, the chambers of commerce, fishermen, and coastal communities all along the Atlantic that have weighed in against the administration's plan to allow drilling off their coasts.  We thought we had put this puppy to bed last year when the Obama administration backed off its plans to have these drilling areas. They backed off because of the opposition. They also backed off when it came to Why? Florida has more beaches than any other We don't have as much coastline. Alaska has the greatest coastline, but the last time I checked, Alaska didn't have a lot of beaches. The one that is blessed with the beautiful beaches is When it comes to beaches, that means people want to go to the beach, and that means there is a significant tourism-driven economy there. We learned what happened with just the threat of there being oil on the beach. Remember the Deepwater Horizon oil explosion off of Louisiana? Let me show you so you don't get confused with all of these colors.  In essence, all of this yellow over on the other side of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, means this area is off-limits. It is in law, and it is a good thing because when the Deepwater Horizon spilled off of Louisiana, the winds shifted, and that oil started drifting to the east. It got as far as Pensacola Beach, and it completely blackened the white, sugary sands. That photograph went all over the world. Pensacola Beach was covered up in oil, and the winds kept carrying it forward. Some of it got into Choctawhatchee Bay and the sands of Destin, and some of the tar balls went as far east as the Panama City Then the winds shifted and carried it back, and that was the extent of the oil on the beach.  For 1 solid year--a tourist year--the tourists did not come to the west coast of Florida because they had seen the pictures of what had happened to Pensacola Beach, all of the way down the west coast--the Tampa Bay area, Sarasota, the Fort Myers area, Naples, Marco The tourists did not come.  Now let's go back to the When you start to do this, you are now threatening the lifeblood of Florida's economy, its tourism-driven economy. It is not only a threat to the environment, but it is a threat to the multibillion-dollar, tourism-driven economy.  In 2010, we lost an entire season, as the tourists did not come to the west coast of That is why, when I gave the list of all of those entities, including the U.Department of Defense, they don't want it. It is because[[Page S7958]]of the military areas. I also mentioned the chambers of commerce. They have awakened to the fact that oil on beaches is a killer of our economy. When this plan is announced later today, probably, it will not be unusual to see local governments spring into action, like the Broward County Board of Commissioners, which has already sent letters that oppose drilling off of Florida's coast.  Floridians understand this issue. That is why, in the past, we have had such bipartisan agreement all over Florida--Republicans and Democrats alike--to keep drilling off of our coast, but if Big Oil gets its way, every inch of the Continental Shelf is going to be drilled. We saw what happened less than a decade ago. The scientists would say we are still uncovering, for example, the full extent of that BP oilspill and its damage.  I urge our colleagues to take up the bill that was filed earlier this year by this Senator, Senator Markey, and others that would block an attempt by the administration to open up our coast to oil drilling.  The stakes are extremely high for the economy of our States all along the eastern coast. Georgia has a substantial tourism-driven economy. You know South Carolina has Myrtle What about North Carolina? What about Virginia's tourism-driven economy and especially with all of the military concentration there? You can go right on up the coast. The stakes are exceptionally high. We simply can't risk it.

The Iran deal allows the United States to license the sale of passenger aircraft to Iran to update their civilian commercial airliner fleet. Despite the deal, Iran's behavior has not changed, and they still remain a principal state sponsor of international terrorism, a direct contributor in propping up the Syrian regime, and a major facilitator of money laundering.  However, enabling commercial aircraft sales could only fortify Iran's rogue behavior. Many, including the Department of Treasury, are concerned that commercial aircraft could be used for noncivilian purposes, considering the state-controlled airline, Iran Air, has facilitated Iran's destabilization of Syria by transporting missile and rocket components to the Syrian regime.  Justice Louis Brandeis once stated that, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,'' and that is what this legislation seeks to do. It simply adds a crucial layer of reporting requirements, certifying that the sale of passenger aircraft does not pose a money laundering risk or violate U.sanctions.  Iranian continues to threaten the stability of the Middle East, and it poses a threat to U.national interests. Holding Iran accountable and preventing them from continuing to destabilize Syria should not be controversial at all.

A Democratic Congress, together with the Republican President, freed the Nation's Capital from government by three unelected commissioners.  The irony is that the self-government the District of Columbia enjoys today is a virtual replica of what a Republican Congress and a Republican President granted to the District of Columbia right after the Civil It granted the Home Rule Act and, of course, a Delegate to  But, with Reconstruction and Democratic control, Democrats took back what Republicans had granted and, once again, Democrats denied the District of Columbia self-government.  Then, 44 years ago, with bipartisan support, after 100 years of struggle, the District of Columbia finally won what we call home rule.  My colleagues should respect their own history. It was Richard Nixon who signed the Home Rule Act, acting on the most revered, as far as we are told, Republican principles of local control, that local residents should always have a democratically elected local government controlled entirely by their government. The District has become one of the most successful jurisdictions in the United States since home rule, with a $14 billion budget.  Before and after home rule however, District of Columbia residents have always paid Federal income taxes. Today, D.residents rank number one--that is first--per capita in taxes paid to support the government of the United  In signing the bill for the Home Rule Act, President Nixon wrote: ``One of the major goals of this administration is to place responsibility for local functions under local control and to provide local governments with the authority and resources they need to serve their communities effectively.''  Since Congress granted the Home Rule Act, it has shown no interest in governing the District of Columbia, but it requires the D.budget to actually be passed again here, by Congress, for the sole purpose of seeking to overturn local laws that Members of Congress don't support.  The basis for our federation of States is that each has its own laws and they must be respected, yet there are eight different laws pending here to be overturned by the Congress of the United  I believe I will be able to retain most of these laws for the District of Columbia, but why should I have to spend any of my time protecting local laws passed by my local jurisdiction?  They range from trying to get rid of all the District's gun laws; making the District pay for private schools out of local funds; the medical aid in dying law, which six States already have and DC would not be allowed to have, although two Republican leaders have such bills in their States; no budget autonomy law; repeal of the nondiscrimination law that the District has based on reproductive choices of family members; no local funds for marijuana commercialization, though that is now done by eight States; and the prohibition on spending for abortions for low-income women. That is done by 17  This is a sampling of what is pending, Mr.Congress allows these same laws to exist in their own local jurisdictions.

173,topic-id,607,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the United States Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant program, and the Fire Prevention and Safety programs.  As an original author of these critical grant programs, I understand their importance to the firefighting community. It is often local firefighters who are the first on the scene before help from elsewhere can arrive. Our first responders provide immediate assistance to those in need; and these grants enable local firefighters across our nation to receive the training and equipment necessary to fulfill this important mission.  The proper training and equipment provided to local firefighters by the AFG and SAFER grant programs and Fire Prevention and Safety programs can often mean the difference between life and death.  It is unfortunate, Mr.Speaker, that it took so long for the House to act on reauthorizing these important federal grants. We have had nearly an entire year for the Majority to introduce a bill, have it considered in committee, and see action on the House floor. Or simply, we could have just considered 829, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on August 2, 2017.  I even introduced H.3881, a House version of the Senate-passed legislation and co-led a letter with 153 members of this House to show support for reauthorizing these grant programs. However, no action was taken to reauthorize these critical grant programs until today.  The bill before us today makes meaningful and technical changes to the administration of these grant programs. One important change this bill makes, that I know is significant to my home state of New Jersey and fire departments across the nation, is permitting the use of these grants to permit the use of grants to change the status of part-time or paid-on-call firefighters to full-time firefighters.  However, unlike the Senate bill, the bill before us today continues to have a dreadful sunset clause. Typically, the Congress sunsets programs to ensure there is an opportunity to review the importance of a program's continuation and that there is no waste, fraud, or abuse. Since the establishment of these fire programs, there have been no major issues with waste, fraud, or abuse--and we certainly cannot dispute the major benefits these programs provide. So it is a wonder why some are insisting on sunsetting these critical grant programs in this bill.  This sunset causes needless anxiety, which many have been feeling this year as the House is only now reauthorizing these programs just two weeks before they're set to expire. This is a situation where states and localities and tens of thousands of fire departments across our nation are left wondering about the future of critical funding they rely on to keep their communities safe. This sunset is unnecessary and we should eliminate it.  It is not an understatement to say that the funding provided by these programs has saved countless lives. The federal resources these grants have provided fire departments with the equipment, training and staffing needed to swiftly respond to over 30 million calls annually. These programs also have improved firefighters' response capabilities and prevented numerous fires through safety programs targeted toward high-risk populations.  Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues Congressman Peter King, Steny Hoyer and Dave Reichert as co-chairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus and for their tireless work on behalf of our nation's fire service.

Despite being outnumbered, Sergeant Basilone and his men successfully defended Henderson airfield from the Japanese assault. In the process, he crossed enemy lines to replenish ammunition, he repaired artillery, and he went several days and nights without food or sleep to lead his troops. He led his troops to victory.

111,topic-id,1131,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Gaetz), for bringing this issue to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, this can all be cleared up, pretty quickly, with a little bit of transparency and with a little bit of sunlight. It comes down to the issue of: Do we have impartial justice in this country or don't we?  We are all familiar with Lady She has a blindfold over her eyes, she is holding the scale, and the scale is straight across. It is not leaning one way or the other. But, in this case, it seems--and I am going to say that kind of tongue-in-cheek--it seems like it is, like the scale is not right across, Mr.It is heavily on one side, and the other side is way up in the air.  And let me just make a couple of points:  Deputy Director McCabe refers to the Clinton email investigation as ``special.''  Why is it special?  Where is it on that scale?  Is it up high or is it down low?  Why is it called special?  Why did Secretary Clinton have a team from headquarters investigate her, as opposed to the Washington field office?  Think about this:  If the FBI called you, it wouldn't be for a meeting or an interview. It would be called your deposition. You would sit there with your lawyer, and you would answer questions. And it wouldn't be when it was convenient for you. It would be when it was convenient for the  Secretary Clinton gets to have a meeting with the FBI for an interview on a Saturday morning of a holiday weekend. Now, contrast that on the scales of justice with Paul Paul Manafort gets his home broken into in the middle of the night and dragged out of bed while he and his wife are sleeping. Something doesn't seem right to me.  You talk about the meeting on the tarmac. The FBI, in their emails, it was revealed that they wanted to get the agent that divulged the fact that that meeting occurred out on the tarmac. They weren't interested in what the meeting was about just days before Secretary Clinton was going to be deposed before this House of Representatives and be questioned and interviewed about her role in  Why does that happen?  It seems like the scales of justice, once again, are tipped.  Peter He interviewed Heather Samuelson, Cheryl Mills, Bryan Pagliano, and Paul Combetta, and they all got immunity. They all got immunity.  Who gives somebody immunity without anything in return?  Okay, they got immunity. We get it. We want to know what was on the other side of that equation. I mean, this is not to apologize for, or to stick up for, Mike Flynn or for Paul If they have committed crimes, that needs to be dealt with appropriately. Lying, period, is never appropriate.  But they didn't get this deal. These folks did get the deal. And, at the same time while they got the deal, we know via their email and interviews that they actually did lie to the Some of these folks lied to the FBI, yet Michael Flynn pleads guilty, and these guys and gals get immunity.  Do the scales of justice, Mr.Speaker, seem like they are a little bit askew?  Mr.Combetta--if that is how you pronounce his name--we know that he was out there searching for ways on the internet about how to scrub a computer. Nothing to see here, right? That seems a little odd, doesn't it?  Cheryl Mills, she got immunity, allegedly, to give up her laptop. So she got immunity; we got that. She can't be prosecuted. We got the laptop. Shouldn't the American people know what was on the laptop? Why is that information not available? Why is it that this Congress, this jurisdiction of oversight, as applied in the Constitution, has to beg and cajole the FBI and the Department of Justice to provide documents so that we can see what happened, so that we can know, so that the American people and their representatives can know how this dossier--if you want to call it that--was constructed and how it was used? Why must we beg for that information, and why can't we get it?  Mr.Speaker, this can all be cleared up; just provide the information. There doesn't have to be another special prosecutor. Mr.Mueller can continue with his investigation and find the truth because we all want the truth. We want the truth that is impartial, not something that is fabricated because we now have an FBI that is pursuing individuals, as opposed to crimes.  The American people need to know that this isn't a tinhorn dictatorship and that we don't have government officials using the power of the Federal Government to work against their political rivals. They need to know that they can trust their FBI, and right now it doesn't seem like they can have confidence in that.  It seems like if you are on the wrong side of the scale, Mr.Speaker, it is a bad day for you. But if you are connected and you have people working for you like--oh, I don't know--Peter Strzok, Bruce Ohr, and his wife now, Andrew Weissmann, or Jeannie Rhee, I mean, as the days go on, we just keep on finding out more and more and more. And we don't find it out because they are offering it. We find it out because we have to pull it from them and just beg them and require them to come in here and force the information out of them. That is not how this is supposed to work.  We need to have confidence in our FBI, and we need to have confidence in our Department of American citizens need to have confidence in their judicial system to know that the blindfold is still on Lady Justice, that the scales are even, that we are all going to be treated evenly, and that crimes are going to be investigated, not individuals. And that there is not going to be some kind of a witch hunt or a lynch mob mentality at the Federal Government level against people with whom the political ruling class disagrees.  If it requires another special counsel, so be it. If not, it would be great if we could just clear all of this up by providing the information that this House of Representatives and the American people demand. There is no reason to keep it. It is not classified; it is not sensitive. It is information that all of us need to know so we know how our Federal Government is operating and who is being truthful with us. And then we can have confidence in the fidelity of our FBI and our Department of  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgH9830-5.txt,2157,COMMUNITY INSTITUTION MORTGAGE RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,12.0,December
703,topic-id,1121,"Madam President, there are a handful of innovations over the years that have redefined the United States and the entire world. The cotton gin, railroads, electricity, and the automobile are just a few examples. However, without question, broadband internet is one of the defining innovations of our time. Broadband internet connects both rural and urban communities to vital services such as telemedicine, educational resources, and international commerce. In fact, broadband internet is absolutely essential for communications in the modern era. It lets us keep in touch with our loved ones no matter where they live,[[Page S7984]]and it has boosted productivity across every single industry. Perhaps most importantly, broadband internet revolutionized our economy and has led to millions of new jobs.  The ability to instantly reach consumers wherever they live has allowed American small businesses and startups to compete with large global corporations in a way that would have been simply unimaginable just a couple of decades ago.  Michigan is home to over 850,000 small businesses and a growing number of startups. The new ideas and creative solutions they generate put America on the cutting edge of a global and interconnected economy. Michigan small businesses are able to compete and innovate because of the free and open structure of the internet, but, unfortunately, these opportunities are at risk.  Tomorrow the FCC will vote to eliminate current net neutrality protections that stop large corporations from stifling small businesses and harming the American people. I think the facts are very straightforward, and the FCC is wrong. They should stop what they are doing and keep the current protections in place.  The current rules that I have consistently supported prevent internet service providers from blocking, slowing, or prioritizing web traffic for their own financial gain at the expense of small businesses and every day internet users. The FCC's actions to roll back these protections could usher in a new era of a two-tiered internet--one for the large corporations that can pay for the fast lane and a slow lane for the rest of us. This will allow internet service providers and multinational corporations to compete unfairly against startups, slowing down their traffic and playing gatekeeper to potential customers.  Let me be clear. Repealing net neutrality is anti-innovation, repealing net neutrality is anti-competition, and repealing net neutrality is anti-consumer.  The FCC should not consider this proposal tomorrow to degrade internet service, especially during a time when over 20 million households in rural America, including far too many in my home State of Michigan, still lack access to high-speed broadband internet.  The FCC has a lot of work to do to close the digital divide, and repealing net neutrality is taking our country backward, not forward. If the internet doesn't work for growing small businesses and startups, our economy will be hurt for generations to come. High-speed broadband and net neutrality in the 21st century is every bit as vital as electricity was in the 20th century. All Americans deserve access, regardless of their income or their ZIP  We accomplished the goal of bringing electricity to every household in this country in the last century, even in the most rural areas, by making it a national priority. We need to make access to broadband internet with strong net neutrality protections a national priority today.  By preserving net neutrality, we put students, artists, advocates, entrepreneurs, and other visionaries, who could be inventing the future and creating the next big thing, ahead of a handful of multinational corporations.  The FCC should call off this dangerous vote and, instead, work to ensure that the internet remains a hub of entrepreneurship, creativity, and competition.                  Children's Health Insurance Program  Madam President, over 2 months ago I stood here in this Chamber, urging my colleagues to pass legislation that will prevent kids enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program from losing their healthcare. The Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, provides healthcare coverage to over 100,000 children in my home State of Michigan and more than 9 million children nationwide.  I recall welcoming the news that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden had reached a bipartisan agreement to extend the healthcare benefits for these children. They worked together and went through regular order. The Finance Committee held a hearing and a markup on the bill in  We all know that regular order has become a very rare event in the Senate today, and I appreciate the bipartisan effort to have a Senate vote on a bill that is absolutely critical to our Nation's children. I certainly expected that this bipartisan bill would come to the floor and pass with broad bipartisan support, thus bringing relief to families across the Nation who are worried about whether their children will continue to have healthcare in 2018. Unfortunately, in the months since those good-faith efforts, we still have not seen a vote on this important legislation. This is inexcusable. We must take action now.  States are already beginning to notify families that their children's healthcare plans may be canceled if Congress does not act. States such as Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, and others have announced that they may run out of funds within weeks. In my home State of Michigan, I have heard from parents who are worried about whether their children will still be able to see their pediatrician next year. I have also heard from pediatricians who take care of these children how children will be hurt if their healthcare is taken away.  It would be unconscionable to rip healthcare services away from children during the most formative years of their lives. It would be unconscionable to put new roadblocks up for families whose children need physicals and vaccines before they can go to school. It would be unconscionable to increase healthcare costs for working families who are just trying to keep their children healthy and give them the opportunity to prosper.  This is not a partisan issue. In 1997, President Bill Clinton worked with a Republican majority both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives to successfully pass the Children's Health Insurance Program into law. That legislation passed with 85 votes in the Senate because providing needed health services to children should never be a partisan issue.  The CHIP program has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis since its inception because it is effective. CHIP is working for our Nation's children, and we should be too.  I urge my colleagues across the aisle to call for a vote on this legislation to extend CHIP and pass it without delay. Let's do what is right for our country's children and families and pass this bipartisan legislation now.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

I also thank Mr.Griffith for introducing the Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower He did valuable work to make this the bipartisan version we see today.  More electricity from hydropower is key to meeting our clean energy goals, to reducing harmful emissions that pollute our air and water and contribute to climate change.  Hydropower is one of the few carbon-free energy sources that provides a steady baseload of electricity. This bill will give closed-loop hydropower projects an expedited process for approval from It will consider interagency input through a new task force and provide appropriate protection for wildlife and endangered species while helping us grow emissions-free energy.  These closed-loop projects often integrate other forms of renewable energy, like solar, to develop a power generation cycle that is clean, secure, and reliable.  In San Diego, where large rivers and typical hydropower generation are less common, closed-loop pumped storage hydropower offers an innovative solution and can have other benefits to the region's energy and reservoir systems.  In my district, the Lake Hodges Pumped Storage Project has provided clean energy since 2012, and a new project at the San Vicente Reservoir is being considered now.  We must consider to have productive bipartisan conversations like these that produce the ultimate goal of streamlining the regulatory process so that hydropower projects can be approved more quickly while still meeting high environmental standards.[[Page H9814]]  I would also like to thank Energy and Commerce Committee leadership and staff for helping advance this bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

882,topic-id,1917,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This rule that we are looking at today has two bills under it, and this is the 56th closed rule allowing no amendments that we are bringing to the floor this year. Over the past year, we have not considered any legislation under an open rule that would allow Republicans or Democrats to bring forward amendments here on the floor.  When the 115th Congress opened, Speaker Ryan promised regular order bills would make their way to the floor after hearings and markups. Instead, we have seen bill after bill rushed to the floor. Many bills haven't even gone through committee or skipped hearings. That is true for the failed healthcare bill, and it is also true for the tax bill currently in conference, the major bill this  This tax bill, that somehow we understand there is a ``deal'' on before the conference committee even met, was crafted behind closed doors, and no Member was able to offer their ideas on the House floor. I offered several bipartisan amendments in the Rules Committee, but they were locked out, as were amendments from every other Democrat and Republican that chose to offer amendments.  The tax legislation would explode our debt. It is a giveaway to wealthy corporations and does nothing to help the middle class.  Now, the benefit of having an open process is creating better ideas: having Democrats and Republicans bring forward those ideas, see who can muster a majority of votes here on the floor of the House, and include that in a tax bill. We are a legislature. That is how we are supposed to work.  Instead, a bill was crafted behind closed doors to raise taxes on 78 million Americans and add $1.7 trillion to the debt. When you add to the debt, that is a tax on future Instead of taxing them today, you are taxing them tomorrow. The tax-and-spend Republican Party continues to add to the deficit and add to the debt day after day after day.  Mr.Speaker, we only have a few legislative days left before the end of the year, and we have very important work to do, like reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program and funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.  There are millions of Americans who have been negatively affected by devastating hurricanes and wildfires in Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, and the Virgin Islands, and Congress has not stepped up to the plate.  There are also over 800,000 aspiring Americans who are at risk of being deported from the only country they have ever known as home because of the reckless actions of President Congress needs to act to find a real solution so DREAMers can continue to work legally in the communities that they live in, and they continue to thrive and give back to make our country even greater.  We have a lot of critical tasks ahead, which is why I am really surprised, with all of this work to do, and only 7 or 8 days to do it, that here we are considering two bills where we will have our debate, but they are not bills of great importance. We are using our floor time--very limited, 7 days before the end of the year--when we could be debating tax reform and offering amendments, when we could be addressing the needs of the DREAMers, where we could actually be doing something about the deficit, reining in out-of-control wasteful government spending. We are not doing any of that.  We are doing two minor bills that are favors for public companies, or whoever they are. I am happy to talk about them. I am going to do my role in debating them. One I am even fairly supportive of. But they are completely separated from the actual concerns of the American people.[[Page H9862]]  No wonder the approval rating of this institution is under 15 percent, because we continue to debate these minor bills under a closed process, when, this very week, we could have had an open process for tax reform. We could be voting on 10 or 20 amendments a day, passing some and rejecting some. I have no problem if I bring forward some Democratic amendment and it fails. That is the process. That is fair.  But we have bipartisan, commonsense amendments that should be part of tax reform. Representative Schweikert and I have a bill to provide a de minimis exemption on taxation for use of cryptocurrencies, to allow them to be used for amounts under $600 in everyday purchases and to remove the specter of IRS enforcement.  Let's put it in. Let's have a vote on it. Let's see if a majority of Congress agrees with me. I hope they do. If not, I am a big boy. It is my job. I can go home. But to not even be able to fight for the issues that my constituents have hired me to fight for is not only the frustration I have, and not only the frustration many Republicans have, but it is the frustration the American people have with this institution.  Now, let's get to these bills. Typically, the Financial Services Committee did not hold a hearing on either of these rules. It is a closed rule.  The first one, H.2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act, would remove privacy notice requirements for financial institutions to consumers that share or sell a customer's personal information with third parties.  We are all for reducing unnecessary regulations. When I get to the next bill, the Republicans are actually trying to add paperwork and regulations. This one does, but it picks a very poor one to get rid of. It gets rid of privacy notices for financial institutions that tell consumers that they can share or sell their personal information. Of all of the places to cut paperwork, why would you want to cut the one piece that consumers and retail investors actually care about?  Back in September, 143 million Americans had their personal and sensitive information shared widely, as a result of a data breach at Congress should be looking at ways to better secure our sensitive information--a cybersecurity bill, better information sharing--instead of actually making it easier for our personal information to be shared more widely and giving you, as the consumer, less ability to find out where it is being shared.  A hearing would be helpful to understand the full effects of this legislation to see what the unintended consequences are. We do know that it would eliminate clear disclosure to consumers about their privacy rights--never a good thing, especially in these times--including a consumer's ability to opt out from having their information sold to certain third parties. We can do better.  The other bill, H.4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act, makes a change to how proxy advisory firms provide information to shareholders. It would require that they make their recommendations available to companies.  This bill is problematic from a number of perspectives. Here is what it does. Proxy advisory firms provide independent advisory services for investors and have fiduciary responsibility to their investors.  Under this legislation, they would actually have to open themselves up to lobbying for companies and add additional paperwork. They would have to register with the SEC, whereas they now don't, before trying to issue vote recommendations or trying to change the corporate board.  Here is who the players are in this fight: On the one hand, you have public companies; on the other, you have investors, which means your pension fund, and mine, Mr.It means university endowments. I know you all don't like those, and you are going to tax them soon. It means, perhaps, using an individual investor, through a mutual fund or other vehicle. So investors on one side, public corporations on the other.  But the problem is: it is not the shareholders of the public companies, it is the insular governance and management structure of those organizations. Many of them do need to be shaken up in the name of efficiency.  There are many examples of investor pressure that has been applied to good effect: to meaningful reforms and corporate governance; preventing conflict of interest, making sure that the board oversees the CEO are not just his golfing buddies, and he is on the board, or she is on the board, of their companies, too.  I have generally been on the side of investor empowerment in that: not to the extreme, not to make it impossible to be a CEO on a publicly traded company, to run a publicly traded company. But, if anything, we should make sure that the actual owners of the companies are empowered to make the changes they need to increase efficiency.                              {time}  1415  This bill goes the wrong way. It adds red tape and paperwork. It adds regulations to investors and prevents them from being able to exert influence in the same way they do today, adding one degree of additional regulation and paperwork to allow them to do the kinds of good governance activities in terms of running competitive fights for boards of directors.  Now, I get that there is another side. There can be a steamy underbelly to investor engagement as well. There are some investors who only care about short-term gains, who try to institute practices or bully management around in a way that is not conducive to long-term value but, rather, just pump-and-dump schemes that they try to make money off of, and I totally get that.  But in general, it is the owners of a company to whom the fiduciary responsibility of the directors and the CEO lie; and we should empower them, for better or for worse, to make the changes to increase the overall productivity of the company.  We should not burden investors with additional red tape, as Republicans are doing, by creating more bureaucracy and paperwork and compliance costs with this bill.  Frankly, I was surprised to see this bill come out of Financial Services Committee because Republicans have been fairly consistent in trying to remove regulations from Dodd-That has generally been the approach. I supported the removal of some of those unnecessary regulations. Others are important regulations, like this privacy disclosure that I don't think is a good idea.  But here, they are actually adding reporting requirements above and beyond Dodd-They are out ``Dodd-Franking'' Dodd-Republicans are saying there is not enough reporting; there is not enough paperwork; there is not enough money going to lawyers and accountants. In Dodd-Frank, we are going to require that they file even more paperwork with the  I think that is the wrong way to go, Mr.Speaker, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to resist this effort to burden shareholders who actually own companies with additional costs and paperwork and prevent them from making necessary management improvements to the companies that, at the end of the day, are run for them, not for the benefit of management.  That is why I oppose this bill. Shareholders should have a right to impartial information about the company in which they have invested. We should minimize paperwork where possible. I have been proud to support a number of bipartisan proposals to do that. This bill goes the opposite way.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

885,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I include in the Record the Republican bill summary from the majority on the Rules Committee for H.4015.                           Committee on Rules               Pete Sessions, Chairman--December 11, 2017  H.4015--Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017       Purpose: To improve the quality of proxy advisory firms for      the protection of investors and the U.economy, and in the      public interest, by fostering accountability, transparency,      responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm      industry.       Background and Legislative History: Each year, public      companies hold shareholder meetings at which the company's      shareholders vote for the company's directors and on other      significant corporate actions that require shareholder      approval. As part of this annual process, the Securities and      Exchange Commission (SEC) requires public companies to      provide their shareholders with a proxy statement before      shareholder meetings. A proxy statement includes all      important facts about the matters to be voted on at a      shareholder meeting, including, for example, information on      board of director candidates, director compensation,      executive compensation, related party transactions,      securities ownership by certain beneficial owners and      management, and eligible shareholder proposals. The      information contained in the statement must be filed with the      SEC before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of      directors and the approval of other corporate actions.      Solicitations, whether by management or shareholders, must      disclose all important facts about the issues on which      shareholders are asked to vote.       In general, state corporate law governs shareholder voting      rights, including the types of corporate actions that require      shareholder approval. However, Section 14 of the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) authorizes the SEC to      promulgate rules governing the solicitation of proxies for      most public companies. SEC Regulation 14A governs proxy      solicitations and sets forth the categories of information      that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations.       Largely as a result of the SEC's regulations, proxy      advisory firms now wield outsized influence in the U.proxy      system. In particular, regulators, market participants, and      academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of      interest inherent in the business models and activities of      proxy advisory firms. For example, as indicated above, proxy      advisor firms may feel pressured by their largest clients--     many of whom are activist investors--to issue vote      recommendations that reflect those clients' specific agendas.      In addition, proxy advisory firms often provide voting      recommendations to investment advisers on matters for which      they also provide consulting services to public companies.

886,topic-id,312,"Mr.Speaker, the reason I do this is, my colleague from Georgia somehow said that it was laughable, this characterization that it is adding paperwork.  That is exactly what this bill does. In fact, in this exhibit, this is a Republican summary of their own bill. It says: ``The information contained in the statement must be filed with the . . .''  The whole bill is about adding paperwork. That is what the bill does. You can argue it is paperwork all you want because corporate CEOs want it and many existing board members want it. Investors don't want it. But we are talking about additional paperwork, and there is nothing in that statement that you can refute because the Republican bill summary explains that that is what they are doing. I mean, there is no disagreement.  And he is correct. I am sure there are some Democrats who support these bills, some Republicans who support them, some Republicans and Democrats who might oppose these bills, but that is what the bill does, it adds paperwork. That is why I mentioned I was surprised to see it come out of the Financial Services Committee that, in general, had been more interested in reducing paperwork. Here, they are interested in adding compliance cost and paperwork to investors.  Mr.Speaker, I have to say that if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Sean Patrick Maloney's bill, H.4585, which would block the FCC's rule rolling back net neutrality from taking effect to ensure the internet remains open to all  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

892,topic-id,1742,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I can see my good friend, Mr.Duffy, is very excited about this, very engaged. It is a hard issue. I don't think many Democrats are that excited either way. They are all going to decide where they stand because it is just a fight between corporate CEOs and big institutional investors. They are both fine. I mean, you have got to pick one or the other in voting ``yes'' or ``no'' on this bill.  I think, as Democrats, we are more interested in how the people are doing who are working for those companies. How are we doing about sustainable practices over time?  Yes, every Democrat and Republican will cast their vote here either for institutional investors or for corporate CEOs and insular boards.  It does add paperwork. We talked about that. Mr.Duffy said: Oh, it adds paperwork. Democrats should like it.  Yes, maybe there are some. I think some Democrats voted for it in committee. There are Democrats that want to increase paperwork. I am not one of them. I want to decrease paperwork and streamline it.  But, no, I am sure there will be some Democrats who support it. There are probably Democrats who, themselves, agree with the corporate CEOs over the institutional investors.  I have taken a company public. I have run private companies. I have seen this world. I think it is a good thing that the share of institutional investment has increased. I don't have the statistics in front of me. The gentleman from Wisconsin said something along the lines of 46 to 75 percent of the capital is institutional.  The big problem in public corporate governance is not too much shareholder engagement; it is not enough. When you have a diffuse shareholder base, when you don't have institutional investors, when you have, proverbially, 200 people who each own half a percent of the company or even more and they never talk and don't know each other, the ability of management to run amok in their own interests, to the detriment of the shareholders, plagues our public marketplaces.  So to have sophisticated, active investors who own enough and can work together, sometimes through these proxy fights when it comes to it, to be able to maximize long-term value is a good thing. It is a good thing.  Of course, everybody can point to times that it has been good for companies and times it has been bad. Generally speaking, this bill is adding paperwork to move the bar the wrong way, to move it towards management, away from shareholders.  I agree you need a balance. I wouldn't support a bill that moved it all the way to shareholders either. You are just encouraging agitators to get in on a short-term basis and speculative basis.  But I think we are close to the right place; and if you ask me where I would move it, I would move it a little the other way to empower shareholders. In fact, I have a bill that does that. It is part of a bigger bill, but it is a bill that gives shareholders more of a direct say over the pay of top executives because, again, there is a problem with insular corporate boards. Part of the answer is empowering institutional investors and empowering individual investors.  So, look, Democrats will hold their nose and vote for either corporate CEOs or for big investors, and that is fine. I firmly think that the best interests of our economy and the people and sustainability lie in moving it toward the investors.  This bill moves it the wrong way and adds paperwork and costs to the investors. So I really think it moves the wrong way, which is why I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''  There was also a discussion, Mr.Duffy mentioned why aren't we just talking about the rule. It is because, Mr.Speaker, like 56 other rules, it is a closed rule.  What else can we say about closed rules? We have said everything. There are no amendments. I could spend an hour complaining about how they are not allowing amendments in and it is closed and so are 56 other rules, but it is more productive to get to the underlying issues because we have had the debate on closed rules 56 times just in the last 10 months.  That is a record, Mr.You should be proud of presiding over a record number of closed rules for a United States But it is not very interesting to talk about for another hour.[[Page H9866]]  So they will talk about an interesting bill, a minor bill. I think I discussed that. I mean, we have a government shutdown; we have an issue with tax reform; we have DREAMers; we have a million things we could be doing. This is a minor bill.  Let's talk about the merits of giving the current corporate boards that might be too insular and the current CEOs and management a little more power, like this bill does, by increasing red tape and paperwork on investors versus the merits of empowering investors. Fine, we will have that discussion. We will cast our ballots. We will see what happens.  Another issue that is very important and timely that this Congress should get to is the one my good friend Mr.Sean Patrick Maloney raised. When we defeat the previous question, we can bring up an issue that, again, is not a partisan issue.  As the cofounder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, said, the end of net neutrality would end the internet as we know it. It is an issue every American citizen is looking to us to take leadership on.  In my time in office, I have had to make a number of controversial votes, whether it is for the Affordable Care Act or repeal of this or that, and oftentimes I hear from constituents on both sides. I remember we got thousands of letters for the Affordable Care Act, thousands of letters against it--very typical.  Net neutrality has been a unique and singular experience in my 9 years in We received 1,500 calls and over 5,000 emails about the issue, and I asked my staff to double-check this because I didn't believe this, and they did. One hundred percent of the emails and calls were for net neutrality. That is right. Not a single constituent of mine contacted me on the other side.  In a district that has a plurality of unaffiliated voters and a similar number of Republicans and Democrats, they are never shy to contact me. So it is not partisan. It certainly united Republicans, unaffiliated voters, and Democrats in my district to be unanimously for net neutrality, which surprised me. But it also means that Congress should not be tone deaf to that, and that is why it is important to defeat the previous question.  Republican Senators like Senator Thune have come together to call on colleagues to come together and protect net neutrality. My good friend and colleague from Colorado Mike Coffman announced that we should--the FCC should delay their vote and that we should protect net neutrality.  It is common sense, Mr.Speaker, and by defeating the previous question, we can get on to an issue that the American people care about rather than a fight between CEOs and investors and which side you take. It is about protecting your internet in your home so you can access the content of your choice--a consumer issue and an issue for small businesses.  We had a digital roundtable last night, Mr.I think thousands of people from my district watched as I had several experts, including several small businesses from Colorado, talk about the importance of net neutrality to them in creating jobs and being able to have a predictable and sustainable business model, and then being able to compete with large, entrenched companies and be disruptive with new innovation.  So I hope that we can defeat the previous question and get on to that. If we don't, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill that adds paperwork and costs, requiring SEC filings for the investors who are fighting bills, who are fighting proxy fights, and then I urge my colleagues to look closely at the privacy bill.  That one, again, I would not characterize as a major bill. I will be voting ``no.'' I understand there might be some Republicans and Democrats voting ``yes'' on that one as well. But, you know, whether they delete that clause or not is hardly the game changer for the economy that tax reform will be.  I have ideas, bipartisan ideas, bills that I have sponsored with my Republican colleagues that should be part of tax reform, that would help the economy go, that would create far more jobs than a two-sentence disclosure, whether it is there or not, and, frankly, more important, also, than this, whether the proxy fight people have to file with the I mean, I am sure they will be able to do it. I mean, yes, you Republicans want to give them more paperwork and create more bureaucracy, but I am sure they will survive.                              {time}  1445  But let's do something important like open process tax reform. We could be debating amendments right now and voting on them like our job--you know, like 100 amendments from Republicans and I would even be open to let's just consider bipartisan amendments, throw out amendments that only Republicans support or only Democrats support.  To be fair, you are in the majority, Mr.Speaker, how about just amendments that Republicans alone support or are bipartisan? You don't have to do any Democratic amendments only because let's just have an open process. Let's allow some amendments.  Every amendment was locked out of tax reform. I offered like, what, 16 myself? I remember my colleague Mr.Woodall was there. They were commonsense ideas. There was a little fix I did with Mr.Tipton from Colorado for Kombucha, that is fermented tea, and it had to do with the tax treatment, de minimis. Senator Cory Gardner supports it in the Senate, our Republican Noncontroversial, next-to-no fiscal impact, and the Rules Committee still didn't even allow me to debate the amendment on the floor for 10 minutes, for 5 minutes, for 1 minute.  Mr.Speaker, enough with these closed rules, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgH9860.txt,1910,IRANIAN LEADERSHIP ASSET TRANSPARENCY ACT,2017.0,13.0,December
894,topic-id,541,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, we have a couple problems with this rule. First of all, the rule brings to the floor the wrong bills. These are minor bills. I will give a recap in a moment, but oh, my goodness. Two sentences of a disclosure and a little more filing costs for pensions and investors. We will get past that. They probably won't become law anyway. You can blame it on the Senate, you can blame it on the House, but most of these things we do don't become law.  I understand that many of my colleagues are frustrated with the Senate, but whatever the case, we just do these things.  But there is stuff that might become law, that could become law, like tax reform; like the fact that the government is shutting down next week if we don't continue the funding. We have a clock ticking on our debt ceiling. We have 800,000 aspiring Americans who don't even know if they can go to work legally, like they can today, in another few months because of President Trump's decision to end their provisional status.  These are real issues--the cost of healthcare going up for my constituents and yours. But we are not doing that. We are bringing up two bills. I will give you the summary of them. Even these two bills, closed process, no amendments. If I was able to offer floor amendments, as I said, I could offer an amendment that would actually move the balance the other way toward investors and empowering investor activism, perhaps even look at giving them a safer pay, if you will, over executive pay, and reining in some of the problems of this bill. But we are not allowed. We are not allowed to offer any amendments here on the floor.  Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again. That is 56, by my count.  That is 56 times Republicans have brought bills to the floor and haven't allowed Democrats or Republicans to offer amendments.  Look, my colleagues can say: Oh, Democrats weren't great on this, and they had too many when they controlled it. You know what? First of all, Republicans set a record. This is the most number of closed rules ever.  Secondly, I am not here to defend the If the Democrats were in[[Page H9867]]charge, they should offer more open amendments. There is no question. But Republicans, whatever they complained about the Democrats, they outdid them by a big factor. Ten months, 56 bills that no single Member of the House is allowed to offer an amendment on just to have a fair up-or-down vote. It is wrong. It is wrong.  That is why I hope my colleagues can defeat this rule to say: Enough is enough.  Mr.Speaker, we have to defeat this rule and move on to the issues important to the American people, and I yield back the balance of my time.

487,topic-id,1598,"Mr.Speaker, I am here to discuss a very serious issue, which are the mounting threats and criticism of Robert Mueller's investigation into criminality taking place in the course of the Presidential election with interference by the Russians and possible collusion with various Americans working with him.  But I want to start by putting this in a general context, Mr.Tom Paine said: ``In the monarchies, the king is law; but in the democracies, the law is king.''  We place everything on the rule of law here in the United States of It is how we control the people who occupy the highest offices of government and control vast amounts of resources that belong to the people of the United  In the monarchies and in the dictatorships, the people have no control over those who occupy government; but in the democracies, in the constitutional societies, we exercise control over the people who lead the government to make sure that they don't abuse their power for improper purposes: for private gain, for the enrichment of particular classes, or for the perpetuation of their own political power.  Now, when we took office at the beginning of this year, Mr.Speaker, we received an Intelligence Committee report, signed by 18 intelligence agencies: the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and on and on.  They all told us the same thing, which is that Vladimir Putin had attempted to interfere and had interfered in the American election through cyber espionage and cyber sabotage in an effort to determine the outcome of our election. That took place. We knew that way back when we first took office.  Now, in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which I serve on, and in the House Judiciary Committee, which I serve on, we were told--and we have been told for months going all the way back to the beginning of the year--that we don't need to investigate this assault on the sovereignty of the American people in our own election because there is an excellent lawyer and law enforcement official in charge of the special counsel investigation: Robert  Indeed, Robert Mueller is a man of extraordinary and, perhaps, singular qualification. He is a decorated war hero from the Vietnam war; a U.attorney, who had been the U.attorney for both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of California; a former Director of the  And do you know what?  Robert Mueller is a registered He was named as special counsel by another registered Republican and another widely heralded and highly-qualified law enforcement official: Rod Rosenstein, who had been a career attorney in the Department of Justice, and then the U.attorney appointed by President Bush in the great State of Maryland, my home State; and who is presently the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, appointed by another Republican: Attorney General  So Attorney General Sessions appointed Rod Rosenstein, who is the Deputy Attorney General, a Republican; and Rod Rosenstein appointed another Republican and a widely admired and highly-qualified law enforcement official, Robert Mueller, to take over as the special counsel.                              {time}  1315  Now, with all these Republicans in charge of the investigation and with the Republicans here in Congress saying, ``no, we won't do any investigations of our own,'' despite past practice, we have to ask why Special Counsel Robert Mueller this week has suddenly come under withering fire by our GOP colleagues in the most ferocious organized attack on a Federal prosecution and prosecutor I have ever seen.  Well, the answer, alas, is obvious. They are attacking Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his fine team of lawyers and investigators because Mueller and his team are doing their jobs and justice is being done. There have already been two guilty pleas arising from this investigation: one from President Trump's former National Security Advisor, General Flynn, who pled guilty to lying to the FBI about Trump-Russia; and another criminal confession and guilty plea from the former foreign policy assistant, George Papadopoulos, who also took full responsibility for his criminal conduct in lying about Trump-Russia to the  And there have been sweeping criminal indictments handed down by the Mueller team, the special counsel, against Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, and his associate, Rick  Now, for all we know, this might be the end of it. The special counsel isn't talking. He is not leaking. He is doing his job. But it is also possible that the investigation is just getting started and that they are closing in on even higher targets: perhaps Jared Kushner, the all-purpose Trump aide and the[[Page H9931]]President's son-in-law, perhaps he is within the scopes of this investigation; perhaps Donald Trump, Jr.; and perhaps the President of the United States himself, Donald  And so the White House has issued its apparently desperate and cornered animal orders. The President cries chaos and let's slip the dogs of war against Special Counsel Mueller and the rule of law. This week, Trump has called the Mueller investigation--an investigation led by a Republican, who is named by a Republican, who is named by a Republican--he calls this investigation ``the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.''  And I don't want to hear from any of my colleagues, either, GOP on the other side, Well, you can't take seriously what the President says because he is disconnecting from reality or he is paranoid or he is delusional, unless you are willing to try to activate the provisions of the 25th We must take the President's word seriously.

On FOX News, a full-scale campaign against the FBI has arisen with lots of people comparing the FBI to the KGB, which is amusing because, if that were true, they would like the FBI--because Donald Trump's best buddy in foreign relations and FOX News' beloved kleptocrat authoritarian dictator abroad is Vladimir Putin, the former chief of the But they compare our FBI, the tens of thousands of men and women who have given their lives to law enforcement in our country, they compare the FBI to the KGB under a totalitarian government.  Newt Gingrich calls Mueller corrupt, Newt Gingrich who was officially reprimanded right here, Mr.Speaker, right where we stand today, by this body. In a vote of 395-28, he was reprimanded and disciplined for violating the rules of this body, and he calls the former FBI Director, Special Counsel Mueller corrupt in an effort to undermine and discredit the special counsel investigation.  And now this propaganda campaign comes to the official channels of the House of Yesterday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing, and I was appalled and I was amazed at the way our GOP colleagues attacked him with a series of completely phony, overblown, and misleading accusations.  They are in full-scale assault mode now. They are in a frenzied wild goose chase to find anything possible to discredit Special Counsel Mueller and his investigators in his team.  And guess what, they finally found their villain. This week they found their villain, and they pounced on him. It is an FBI agent named Peter Strzok, who was working on the Mueller investigation but was removed from it this summer when it was discovered that he had sent a bunch of text messages to his apparent girlfriend criticizing a number of politicians, including Donald Trump, whom he called an idiot, Mr.I think he was watching one of the Presidential debates where he sent a text message to his girlfriend, writing: ``OMG, he is an idiot.'' That is the way I am reading the texts that were revealed to us yesterday.  Now, he was probably one of millions of people to send that exact same text across the country. It wasn't a very nice thing to say, but he said it. He also called Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate for President, the Vermont U.Senator, an idiot. He called Trump an idiot; he called Sanders an idiot; and he had even more choice, unspeakable words for my friend, the former Governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley, which I don't think I can repeat on the floor, Mr. All right. Mr.Strzok was speaking his mind in these private texts, but it raised the potentiality of bias in one of the agents working on the team. And so what did Mr.Mueller do when he learned of it? He fired him immediately. He got him off of the investigation, removed him from the investigation, and put him into a different part of the He removed him immediately from the investigation.  Unlike President Trump, for example, who took 18 days to fire General Flynn after learning that Flynn was a serial liar about his connections with  So it took President Trump 18 days. Mr.Mueller fired the guy immediately because people make mistakes, they do the wrong thing, and Mueller said: I don't want him on my team. He removed him, and they put him somewhere else.  Now, that should have been the end of the matter; right? It sounds like the end of the story is not a big deal. But, on the eve of our hearing yesterday, we received a dump of hundreds of these private text messages between Mr.Strzok and his friend, ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgH9930.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,14.0,December

834,topic-id,1838,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the Trump administration's irresponsible plans to dismantle net neutrality.  This is a very important and timely issue for Rhode The Federal Communications Commission's--the FCC's--efforts to repeal net neutrality protections could have a devastating impact on students, small businesses, and ordinary Rhode Islanders who cannot afford to pay higher premiums on internet traffic.  I have joined many of my Democratic colleagues in urging the FCC to abandon its reckless plan because it would radically alter the free and open internet as we know it and be an abdication of the FCC's responsibility to protect consumers.  Net neutrality does something incredibly important. It requires internet providers to treat all data equally. Net neutrality ensures a level playing field for everyone on the internet. It means free and open access to websites and information.  Over the past 20 years, the internet has become central to the lives of Rhode Islanders and, indeed, millions of Americans--practically every From students completing homework assignments to small businesses conducting e-commerce, or family members communicating with loved ones on the other side of the country or the world, the internet is now our primary means of communication. As such, I believe this is an issue of fundamental fairness and equality of opportunity.  This proposed repeal of net neutrality protections undermines the principles of a free and open internet and could be an unprecedented giveaway to big broadband providers, benefiting a few large corporations at the expense of their customers who use and rely on affordable access to the internet every day.  Net neutrality protections also ensure that all content is treated equally. Without these rules, large internet service providers may choose to block, throttle, or prioritize certain internet traffic. Without these protections, big internet service providers will be given the power to erect virtual toll booths for some customers and fast lanes for others. As a result, the repeal of net neutrality rules will likely be bad for consumers, businesses, students, and everyday Americans who cannot afford to pay additional premiums for internet access.  If these rules are repealed, internet providers can essentially say, if you want a quick download from a Web site, you have to pay more. They can go to businesses and ask them to pay more for this fast service. They can't do that today. Everyone is treated equally.  This is particularly important when it comes to small businesses. As I go around Rhode Island to small businesses, as I have done these last few weeks, one of the reasons they are growing is because they are starting to take a presence on the internet. They have an internet business; they are beginning to sell across the country or across the globe. A small business in Wickford, RI, East Greenwich, RI, or Smithfield, RI, is not going to be able to pay the same premium for access that Amazon or a big corporation like Walmart can, and they will be squeezed further. The reason a lot of these small businesses are able to keep a store open in Rhode Island--or anyplace else in the country--and employ local workers is because they are starting to see a share of their profit come from the internet. They would like to see that grow, but if that diminishes, then the pressure on them to stay in business locally becomes acute.  These are real consequences, not hypothetical. If these rules are repealed and net neutrality is done away with, the consequences for businesses, communities, and individuals will be significant.  Let me make another example. Places of learning like our libraries, schools, and institutions of higher education all rely on offering internet access, which is already expensive. I did a press event at a public library, and they pay significant amounts of money so they have broadband access, and it is a mecca for everyone to come. The head librarian told me that they have people sitting on their doorsteps in the morning before they open and after they close so they can get a broadband signal from the library. Why are they doing that? You can't get a job today unless you can get online because that is where they post job offerings, that is where you have to send your resume, that is where you have to get the response back when you have a job interview. If you can't get on the internet, the chances of getting a job today are close to zero. It was a lot different 20, 30, or 40 years ago, when you could go down to the factory, fill out the form, pass it over the divider to the person in charge, and they would give you a telephone call back or you would come back in a few days and see how you were doing.  Local libraries are also the place where students across Rhode Island and the Nation gain access to the internet to do their homework, apply to college and financial aid, and explore the world around them. This is particularly the case in poorer neighborhoods. They can't afford to have computers or internet in their home. If you go to the public library in South Providence, right next to Michael's Church, in the afternoon, the kids are all there and are on the computers doing their homework. They can't do[[Page S7962]]that, in many cases, at home. They simply don't have the access.  We are always sitting around here talking about how we have to educate our young people and how we have to get them ready for a technologically challenging world, and then we are about to pull the rug right out from underneath them because that library will not be able to afford access to some sites that these young people need.  It is not just the young people who are using the libraries; it is also seniors who want to stay in touch with their families. There are functions that are so critical--as I mentioned before, you literally cannot apply for a job today unless you can get online. How does a person struggling, particularly in low-income, working-class neighborhoods, get online when they can't afford already expensive service, which could be more expensive if these rules are withdrawn and net neutrality is abandoned?  I heard about all of this in detail when I visited the Providence Public Providence is an urban center, so there are other ways, perhaps, to compensate for access to libraries. But when you go to a rural area, those libraries are especially important. More than 83 percent of libraries report that they serve as their community's only provider of free internet and computing services in rural areas. If you need free service, the only place you can go to is the library. This is going to put another cost on them at a time when public-private support is being diminished.  We have a tax bill pending before us that is going to eviscerate charitable contributions. It is going to take away the deduction. Some of that money goes to our public libraries. If it doesn't go there, they will not have access.  I mentioned small businesses because, as I said, this is particularly critical. We have seen an improving economy, and for a lot of small businesses, that is because they are starting to have a presence on the internet. If that presence now comes with a higher price because the providers can say that if you want to get access and fast downloads, you have to pay X, once again, that X to a small mom-and-pop business could be huge. That X to an Amazon or Walmart is just a rounding error.  We know it is going to happen. It is not fair. It undercuts what we think is the heart and soul--I know it is the heart and soul of our economy in Rhode Island for small business, and it is another big benefit for the well-to-do businesses that can pay more and will pay more. This is not a direction we should be going.  Even more disturbing is that the FCC's proposed action may be based on a skewed public record. As we all know, under the Administrative Procedure Act, when a rule or change is proposed, they have to take public comments. There are credible reports that bots--the electronic networks of computers--impersonating Americans filed hundreds of thousands of phony comments to the FCC during their net neutrality policymaking process, thus distorting the public record. Their supposedly fact-based and comment-based approach could be fictitious. It could be a product of special interests who decided to link together thousands, or maybe hundreds of thousands, of computers that randomly generated messages--or not so randomly, but deliberately generated messages.  What we have done is join our colleagues, and we have urged that the FCC abandon this proposal. As I said, I have joined many of my colleagues in asking, at least, that the FCC delay the vote on net neutrality until it can conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that it has a clear and accurate understanding of the public's view on this important topic. It is not based on a group of individuals and many electronically linked computers; it is based on the true sentiment of a broad range of the public. At least delay the proceeding until you can assure us that.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. This attempt appears to be part of a larger program the Trump administration is using to roll back regulations that protect ordinary working men and women throughout the country. The Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, and the administration seem to say, very deliberately, that this is their goal. Just roll back regulations, without analysis that is appropriate, without a sensitivity to the benefits as well as the costs.  My view is that rather than trying to limit access to the internet, they should be doing things to make it easier, make it cheaper for small businesses, for libraries, for individual Americans to get on and use the internet, not to take advantage of the rulemaking process to fatten the bottom line of big companies that are doing quite well already.  It is clear that the FCC should not vote this week, or ever, to repeal net neutrality protections that have benefited so many Rhode Islanders and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to the FCC's proposed dismantling of the net neutrality rules. It is important. It is important for our constituents. It is important for our small businesses. It is important for our future generations as they prepare for a very complicated and challenging world, and, for some of them, the only way to get access to the computer is the public library. The only access for a small business to the new marketplace on the net is being able to afford to be on the net. That is all in jeopardy today. I hope we can stop these net neutrality rule appeals, and do it immediately.  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgS7958-2.txt,1982,0915,2017.0,12.0,December

1062,topic-id,4406,"Madam President, as Republicans in both Chambers rush to conclude their secret negotiations on the final details of their tax bill, I want to make clear to my colleagues what should be obvious about this legislation. We may not yet know the results of all of their horse-trading leading up to the final legislation, but the American people are watching this process. It is plain to see that, should this Republican bill become law, Republicans will have knowingly and deliberately made worse the most dangerous threats that we face to our economic and national security. Worse yet, they will have drained the public coffers that our children and our children's children will need to take up these challenges.  We all know what these challenges are. We face unprecedented income and wealth inequality that threatens to stifle the social mobility that is the hallmark of the American There is also declining productivity, which has kept middle-class wages stagnant, and bred economic anxiety for too many parents wondering if their children will attain a higher standard of living--much higher, they hope--than they have achieved. We have a surging deficit from decades of trickle-down economics and unpaid-for wars that, if left unaddressed, could apply huge pressure to our ability to keep our most basic promises to the American people, not to mention meeting our obligations as a world power.  To the families watching what is going on in Washington right now, the Republican end game appears to be to invite fiscal crisis due to irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, and then, because we have already given trillions of dollars away in tax cuts, to demand that Congress shred Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other vital programs in order to pay our bills. We know this is the road that this bill sets us upon, and the American people certainly see this coming. So let no one who votes for this bill say that they did not know the consequences of their actions. This will not be remembered as tax reform, but rather as a serious mistake to be corrected in the future.  How do middle-class Americans know that Republicans did not write this bill for them? Because they have watched Republican economics rig the tax system in favor of the wealthy and corporations for years, even as wealth and income inequality have reached historic levels. They took the Republicans at their word when Republicans promised that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, which skewed tax relief to the top[[Page S8026]]1 percent over the bottom 20 percent of Americans by more than 6 to 1, would eventually trickle down. That is what they thought, but on the eve of the great recession, aftertax income for the richest 1 percent had soared while middle-class wages continued to stagnate. We are still waiting for the Bush tax cuts to trickle down and to pay for themselves. They likely never will.  These Republican proposals make matters even worse by financing tax giveaways for big business and the rich on the backs of those just trying to get by. Economists, relying on the Federal Survey of Consumer Finances, recently determined that the top 1 percent of American households now hold about 40 percent of the Nation's wealth, which is a 50-year high. This legislation overwhelmingly benefits them while raising taxes on 48 percent of American taxpayers by 2027.  Many of the families whose taxes will go up have already been through tough economic times during the Great Productivity in the American workforce has been declining, and wages have grown at an even slower pace than that. These families don't need numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to know our Nation's recovery was historically slow. But our middle-class weathered the Great Recession as Americans have always done. Now, because of the lopsidedness and deficit-busting features of the Republican tax bill, Moody's Analytics has warned that this ``fiscal policy mistake'' could very well take us prematurely into an economic bust. Middle-class families have just emerged from the last crisis of Republican economics, still battered and bruised, and they know that, if Republicans force a plan like this on the Nation again, it will be their children who are on the hook to pay for it.  Make no mistake, there are times when running a deficit is advisable or even economically necessary--particularly when times are tough and families need help to stay in the working class and get back on their feet. But regressive tax cuts just sit on our credit card with little to show for all that red ink, and the tab we are leaving the next generation is still running from 16 years ago.  Like many of my colleagues, I was here to take the tough votes and make the hard choices that led to the Clinton-era surplus. The failed experiments of supply-side economics turned that surplus into a CBO-projected deficit of over $10 trillion over the next decade. And even if we accept all of the rosy assumptions of dynamic scoring and take it on faith, yet again, that wealth will trickle down and that no recession will come in the next decade--all of which are assumptions on which I wouldn't wager anything--the Joint Committee on Taxation calculates that this bill would still increase the deficit by over $1 trillion. Facts do not go away simply because we ignore them, and if Republicans continue to ignore the budget hole their policies create, then this massive deficit and the budget pressures that follow it will be their legacy for future generations.  More importantly, however, I must ask: What national priorities will our colleagues on the other side deem too expensive after we have given 1 trillion more borrowed dollars to the wealthy? What choices will Republicans try to force on the American people when they decide there simply isn't enough for the Armed Forces, the jobless, the sick, and the elderly? Republican leadership is already vowing to take up ``entitlement reform'' next year, which is Washington-speak for giving the top 1 percent everything they want and then forcing practically everyone else to choose who loses their Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid to plug the budget hole. Therefore, before Republicans blow apart the Federal budget yet again, it is worth reviewing the massive costs the American people are already committed to pay.  First, as I have discussed before, this bill essentially guarantees that we will struggle to meet the needs of our national defense. Our war deficits from the past 16 years alone are projected to add over $1 trillion to the national debt by 2023 and over $8 trillion by 2056. We all know we must modernize the nuclear triad, which will cost $1.2 trillion in 2017 dollars over the next 30 years. A 355-ship Navy would cost, on average, $102 billion per year through 2047. Necessary additions to the end strengths of the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps will cost an additional $18 billion, $6 billion, and $3.6 billion, respectively. Where will this money come from, since we have already given it away to the wealthiest Americans?  This chart shows what happens to the defense budget when large-scale tax reductions are put into effect, starting in the Reagan era of the 1980s. One of President Reagan's first initiatives was to build up defense. This chart shows the percentage of GDP devoted to defense spending. President Reagan promised to make America strong. To actualize his feeling and view of peace through strength, he built up the defense budget significantly--going from a little over 5 percent of GDP when he took office up to almost 7 percent. But in the mid-1980s, he also engineered tax cuts that lowered taxes on the wealthy in proportion to lower income Americans, and eventually, those tax cuts and the deficit caught up with defense spending. As we notice, through the later 1980s and all the way into the 1990s, except for one respite, we had a declining defense budget. In the first year of the George Herbert Walker Bush administration, there was another attempt to decrease defense spending. So the line went up a bit, but after that, of course, with deficits increasing, with other pressures mounting on the budget, defense spending plummeted.  Then, within the Clinton administration, there was a conscious effort to reduce defense spending. The so-called Cold War peace dividend took place. At the same time, though, because of the tough votes on tax reform that we took, we were building up a significant surplus.  We saw again here, with the beginning of the George Bush administration, an increase in defense spending. Once again, that was a product the desire of the President to lower taxes, which he did, but more importantly, was the unexpected and catastrophic attack on the United States on September 11, 2001. That, together with the later decisions to go into Iraq and maintain our presence in Afghanistan, led us to increase defense spending, but, once again--once again--a growing deficit with tax cuts, with no increases to pay for wartime operations, saw the defense budget peak and then begin to decline, and we are in that decline right now.  If history is any judge, when we pass these tax cuts, I think we will see a further decline as defense spending is squeezed by an already-acknowledged increased deficit and by the difficulty of cutting other programs to relieve budget pressures. We are not positioning ourselves well. As I previously mentioned, we are already looking ahead at necessary expenditures totaling trillions of dollars over the future, and if we don't make them, it will leave our Armed Forces, and indeed our position in the world, in a very precarious position.  The irony will be that many of my colleagues will come down here and vote one day soon on a huge tax reduction for the wealthiest, including a $1.5 trillion deficit increase, and on the next day say: ``We need more money for our military, that is the most important thing.'' If our military were the most important thing, we would be voting on a bill to provide that type of financial support and relief to the military today, and letting the tax cuts for the wealthy wait.  This is one of the remarkable periods in our history; probably the first time in our history, that we have conducted a war for 16 years, and have yet to ask the American people, in any significant way, to participate by paying their fair share for the national defense. In fact, throughout this period, with rare exceptions, we have cut taxes, and the cuts have basically benefited the wealthiest That is why all of this together has caused former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck Hagel to indicate that this tax bill is ill-advised. Following 16 years of debt-financed war, providing even bigger deficit-busting tax cuts doesn't make any sense for our national security.  My previous comments, along with the comments of former Secretaries of Defense and others seem to have touched a nerve with Speaker Ryan because, when asked specifically, he took some umbrage at these comments. In an interview with NPR, he said he simply could not understand where our[[Page S8027]]concerns were coming from. To put it bluntly, I am comfortable siding with three former Secretaries of Defense over the Speaker when it comes to budgeting for the men and women of our Armed Forces, for the reasons I outlined in my discussion of the history of defense spending and tax cuts over the last 30-plus years. Inevitably, the tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, because of the way this bill is structured, will put pressure on defense spending. What I don't want to happen is to have people down here 2 months from now pounding the desks about how we are not responding to the needs of our troops, saying that we haven't made them the most important thing in our lives, or that we are neglecting our national defense. Frankly, they have ignored this whole topic by committing to give tax cuts and increase the deficit. That is the wrong priority, in my view.  As the chart clearly demonstrates, these tax cuts eventually catch up with us. They produced defense cuts--maybe not immediately, but we are not working on a situation like we had in 2001. When President George Bush instituted his tax cuts, we had a $5 trillion surplus on the books. That was because we took those tough votes in the 1990s to increase taxes and to build up a surplus.  We don't have that pad any longer. We are already $10 trillion in the hole, so the effect of these cuts will be much quicker and much more dramatic when it comes to the situation we will face not only in terms of supporting our military, but actually taking major steps to upgrade the platforms, the technology, the training, the readiness, and the quality of life of the Armed We don't have a $5 trillion surplus to dip into to pay off the wealthiest while we try to fix defense. We are in a situation where advocacy for this tax cut, in my view, totally and deliberately ignores the costs we are going to have to pay to protect ourselves. For the first time in our history, we have conducted almost 20 years of war, and we have asked our troops and their families to serve, but we haven't asked any other American to stand up, at least with their financial support, and help us deal with the crises we face across the globe.  It is not just our Armed Forces that will be squeezed and crowded out of the Federal budget because of these Republican proposals; the middle class and the working poor will also have to do a lot more with a lot less.  Many of my colleagues have already pointed out that the CBO has estimated that 13 million Americans will lose their health insurance because Republicans will repeal the individual mandate to pay for tax cuts. They can try to spin this as an expansion of choices, but the bottom line is that more people will be sick, and fewer of them will get the care they need.  Other middle-class American families can expect to lose access to critical tax advantages that allow them to remain self-sufficient during hard times. This approach promises to crush families on two fronts. It will force more families who are down on their luck to slip out of the working class, and then, because of massive deficits, the social safety net will be weakened when these families need it the most. This legislation will likely trigger a $25 billion cut to Medicare in 2018 alone, and with the Republicans' entitlement reform on the docket for next year--publically announced by Speaker Ryan--this may just be the tip of the iceberg. If we pass this tax bill, under our pay-go rules, we are in a position where we will be facing a $25 billion cut to Medicare just next year, in 2018. Indeed, for many Americans, this vote is not about taxes, it is about Medicare--what they thought they had earned and are entitled to, what their children believe they need in order to withstand the obvious health problems as one ages.  This does not even begin to cover the struggles facing working-class Americans every day. We are in the midst of a historic decline in labor force participation that economists are struggling to explain, and many States that are experiencing deep declines in labor force participation are among those hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. A few weeks ago, President Trump declared a public health emergency on opioids. Where are the resources coming from to face that national emergency? There will not be that much left after this tax cut.  What we are beginning to see--this is not cause and effect, but it is a correlation--is that a lot of individuals are leaving the workforce because they feel displaced by new technology or because they are noncompetitive or for a number of reasons, and this seems to correlate very highly in those States with large losses with this opioid epidemic. In my home State of Rhode Island, this epidemic is real. It is taking the lives of individuals. On a national scale, it is something that has already been proclaimed a public health emergency by the Again, where will the money come from after these tax cuts? Will the problem just go away? I doubt it. The money is going away, but not the problem.  We have to ask ourselves: If we are in a national public health emergency, why aren't we standing up and providing the resources to help Americans face this problem? It goes back to the same logic: If we are in our 16th or 17th year of war, why aren't we standing up and saying that we better put up some money for the troops, their equipment, and their families?  No--what my colleagues are saying is: We had better cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, for corporations. We have to create loopholes for passthrough entities that give advantages to private equity concerns, legal firms, accountants, and others.  As we look at these problems, millions of Americans are sitting around their dinner tables, and they don't believe we need to give trillion-dollar tax cuts to corporations that have international operations. They are more likely thinking about more mundane things closer to their lives, such as, what about the roads and bridges in my community? Why does this country have an investment backlog in transportation of $836 billion for highways and bridges and $122 billion for transit? Why aren't we doing the big infrastructure bill that the President indicated during the campaign--which is going to cost real money? Instead, we are giving real money away.  This makes a huge difference--because pursuing tax cuts first doesn't just neglect infrastructure, it neglects jobs. The jobs infrastructure projects create are middle-class jobs. These are not the private equity analysts. These are not the sophisticated financial engineers. These are the laborers, the structural engineers, and the men and women who pour the concrete. They are not going to get much out of this tax bill. At the family dinner table, they are probably wondering how they can afford to send their children to college.  How can they even continue to send their children to elementary and secondary schools that are in a horrendous state of repair? The Department of Education has estimated it would cost $197 billion to bring all public schools in the United States to good condition, and there is a $30 billion funding gap in annual capital construction and new facility funding. This is not just a Rhode Island problem; this is a problem in every State of the Public school buildings are decrepit, and we are sending children to those schools. If this legislation passes, where will we find the money to help State and local communities deal with these issues so that children can go to schools that are modern, up-to-date places where they can learn?  Once you get past the elementary and secondary education levels, today everyone insists the jobs of the future all require more than a high school education. We have a generation that has racked up about $1.3 trillion in student loans and is facing a job market that provides few opportunities and not enough opportunities to pay them off. They are worried. People are worried that their children--many of whom are still living with them after college--will never be able to pay off these loans. Where is the multibillion-dollar package of assistance, aid, and loan forgiveness that will allow this generation of Americans to have the same benefits that my generation had? That is not the situation today. Everyone in this Chamber knows this because, when they go home, they hear from parents who are wondering when their child will ever get out from underneath the significant debt they have.  These are all real problems that working families face. There is another[[Page S8028]]problem that is looming and will exacerbate these problems even more dramatically. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 30 percent of the work done by 60 percent of occupations today is vulnerable to automation. By 2030, 75 million to 375 million--up to 14 percent--of the global workforce will need to change jobs. These advances in artificial intelligence could cause a huge erosion in human jobs.  What are families doing? What should we be doing? Frankly, we should be thinking of ways we can help people make the transition, and prepare them for what we know is coming. We know there is going to be a huge loss of jobs. We know that, when people drop out of the workforce, when companies get smaller, their pension obligations don't get that much smaller. We are also facing huge shortages in terms of pensions.  One of the ironies I suggest will happen--``irony'' is too gentle of a word--is that these corporations that are getting huge tax benefits are not going to raise wages. They are not going to turn it over to the people who work for them. They will buy back their stock, and some of these companies will buy back their stock even though their pension plans are not fully funded. That is not only an irony but an additional problem with the approach we are taking to this legislation.  The jobs in danger are not all entry-level positions. This is not about somebody who has a pick and a shovel and is displaced by a machine. We are talking about jobs, for example, in radiology. With computers and artificial intelligence today, doctors will admit they can read x-rays better than many technicians. They can do it in such a way that you don't need as many radiologists to review the records. They can be much more efficient. We are talking about jobs that are not core, entry-level jobs done by people who can easily do something else. We are talking about people who have master's degrees, who have years of training. This is going to come very quickly. What do they do? How do they compensate? Where do they get a job?  We know that this is going to happen, and we are weakening ourselves financially from being able to respond. Yet the legislation that is being proposed is oblivious to what we know is going to happen.  People will come here and say: ``We need more money for national defense.'' Why don't we do that now, instead of giving a big tax cut and raising the deficit?  In a few years or few months, people will say: ``This opioid crisis is out of control; it is even worse than it was when the President declared it an emergency.'' Let's do something.  We don't have the money. In a very few years, when people say, ``We are losing hundreds of thousands of good jobs; let's do something,'' the answer will be ``Sorry, we can't.''  By the way, we don't have much of a safety net for those people who are being displaced by these machines because we have eroded that too. We have huge challenges before us. The American people are watching us. They know these things. They are seeing in their workplace machines gradually replacing human beings. If you are a driver for UPS and you haven't figured out yet that these big companies are buying autonomous vehicles, they are using drones to deliver packages, et cetera--they understand what is coming. They see their children with huge debt living at home because they can't afford to buy a home, given their school loans. They sense the fragility of not only their own job but also the support for their parents on Medicare and  One of the things I thought was interesting when I heard we were going on to entitlement reform is the fact that the biggest amount of money spent in Medicaid go to nursing homes, and it goes to individuals who are not the poorest of poor. They are middle-class people, seniors, or people with long-term disabilities who have exhausted most of their funds. They have sold their house or mortgaged their house, et cetera, and they are the ones who are taking the bulk of the Medicaid money and funding. If we cut Medicaid, what we are going to do is tell a lot of middle-class people: You are out; you are out of this nursing home. Or we are going to tell their sons and daughters: You thought you had a problem paying off your children's tuition; you thought you had a problem at work because you haven't had a raise in several years. Guess what. Unless you come up with $1,000 extra a month, your mother is out of that nursing home.  That is the reality. That is what Americans around their kitchen tables and coffee shops are talking about. They are not talking about big tax cuts for the wealthiest corporations and individuals. It is no surprise that, if you look at any of the polling with respect to this tax bill, the American people are against it. My colleagues, particularly on the other side, are committed to getting something through that the American people don't want. They have said it. The polling has been extensive: We don't want this; we have real problems at home.  I am here to say that I believe this is a great mistake. I don't think any of us going forward should be in a position to say: Someone should have told me; someone should have told me that we need trillions of dollars to improve our defense above and beyond the current money we are spending. Somebody should have told me that hundreds of thousands--if not millions--of good jobs are going away because of artificial intelligence. Someone should have told me that young people are drowning under college debt, and we should fix that. Someone should have told me that we are in a situation where working conditions and the prospect of work is so fragile for so many people.  I think this is a great mistake. I hope my colleagues will reflect on what we are about to do and reject it.  I yield the floor.

238,topic-id,431,"Mr.Speaker, a few days ago, we learned of the Department of Justice's decision to open an investigation in the appalling practice of abortion providers harvesting and trafficking aborted babies' body parts for profit--finally.  Mr.Speaker, as my colleagues surely remember, in July of 2015, senior Planned Parenthood officials were caught on camera discussing how abortion procedures could systematically be altered in order to preserve certain organs so that they could be sold to researchers. They talked of ``crushing'' here and ``crushing'' there, being careful to preserve little parts of a baby's body because they are valuable on the research market. They talked of menus for organs and how lucrative these arrangements could be.  It was sick, callous, and completely inhuman. It also happens to be against the law. Soon thereafter, several of my colleagues and I called for an investigation into these disturbing revelations.  But, Mr.Speaker, our demands fell on deaf ears. Attorney General Loretta Lynch turned a blind eye and didn't pursue an investigation. Even after multiple congressional committees referred their own investigations to the authorities at the Department of Justice, nothing was done.  At the time, I said it was disappointing, but hardly surprising. We all know how much political weight Planned Parenthood throws around in this town. But, Mr.Speaker, in this country, no one is above the law.  That is why I was so pleased to receive word that the Department of Justice, now under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appears to be following up on the evidence and taking our calls for an investigation seriously.  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, who I am proud to say was formerly my chief of staff, requested unredacted documents from the committee's investigation into the suspected harvesting and trafficking of fetal tissue. He said, for now, the documents are for investigative use only, and a formal resolution may be required for further proceedings, such as a grand jury.  I appreciate the Department of Justice's attention to this, and I know I am not the only one who will be watching this closely.  When the terrible videos first surfaced in 2015, I immediately came to the House floor and stood right here in the well and spoke out about this outrageous activity. Someone later told me I was the first one to speak on the floor, and, Mr.Speaker, I will be the last, if I have to.  I said then: ``I promise . . . we are not done talking about this.'' Today, I am glad that has proven to be true.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-13-pt1-PgH9850.txt,1986,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,December

313,topic-id,254,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3971, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act, and I thank Representative Tenney for her hard work on this piece of legislation.  At the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, we often talk about right-sizing regulations. If we want to have a robust financial system that balances smart regulation and consumer protections with the need to make capital available to American consumers, we need to consider targeted opportunities to tailor requirements to fit the size and nature of the financial institution. Representative Tenney's legislation does just that.  This Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act directs the CFPB to exempt creditors with $25 billion or less in assets from certain costly escrow and impound requirements on loans secured by a first lien on a consumer's principal dwelling. These requirements are especially burdensome for community financial institutions. They often force institutions to pass increased costs on to their consumers. This can drive business away from small banks and credit unions which are already suffering from overregulation and other economic challenges. As a result, in some cases, community financial institutions have exited the mortgage business altogether. This does not help consumers, and it further imperils our shrinking number of community banks and credit unions.  This bill offers a targeted, reasonable fix so that these institutions can continue to serve their customers. This is smart. It is reasonable. It is common sense, particularly for those who understand how overregulation from Washington, D.C., has hurt consumer choice.  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

H.2872 would allow FERC, in consultation with Federal and State resource agencies, as well as Native American Tribes, to establish an expedited licensing process for installing hydropower generation at existing dams that don't produce electricity by exempting these projects from regulation under the Federal Power  Mr.Speaker, under this bill, FERC would be required to provide a final decision on license applications within 2 years of receiving a completed application for new generation projects at nonpowered dams that are completely constructed as of the date of the bill's enactment and which aren't generating electricity through hydropower. Eligible projects, Mr.Speaker, must not result in any material change to the storage, release, or flow operations of the dam.  H.2872 would also require FERC to establish an interagency task force, consisting of relevant Federal and State agencies, as well as Native American Tribes, that would all coordinate the authorizations necessary to license the facility.  FERC would also be required to gauge the safety of non-Federal dams under consideration and to require the facility to meet the Commission's dam safety requirements throughout the term of the license.  Additionally, Mr.Speaker, FERC would work with the U.Army Corps of Engineers, as well as the Interior and Agriculture Departments, to develop a list of existing nonpowered federally owned dams with the greatest potential for non-Federal hydropower development.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, H.2872 would exempt hydropower applicants from having to pay annual fees associated with the licenses until construction actually commences on the project.  Mr.Speaker, H.2872 represents a major step in the right direction for increasing our ability to issue hydropower permits in a fair, transparent, and expedited way, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this notable bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgH9809.txt,1003,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,12.0,December

Mr.Speaker, H.1733 represents a commonsense bill aimed at saving energy and protecting the environment by finding additional ways to reuse lubricating oil.  Mr.Speaker, these measures may include increasing the collection of used oil, distributing public information on sustainable reuse, and encouraging the recycling of used oils.  Mr.Speaker, the U.is responsible for almost one-quarter of the global lubricating oil market; however, unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, we are currently behind our European counterparts in our ability to recycle this product.

820,topic-id,463,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.2880, the Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower  Mr.Speaker, as I have stated many times before, I am a strong supporter of hydropower, which provides clean, renewable, carbon-free, reliable energy for millions of American businesses and households. Therefore, Mr.Speaker, I must commend my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague Mr.Griffin from Virginia for sponsoring this important, bipartisan piece of legislation. I must also applaud the work of the committee staff from both sides of the aisle for their tireless work in negotiating a bill that I believe all Members can fully support.  Mr.Speaker, closed-loop pump hydroelectric storage facilities operate in a capacity similar to batteries in that when there is a surplus of energy, water is pumped to an upper reservoir, and when more energy is needed, that water can then be released to produce electricity through the use of turbines.  Mr.Speaker, H.2880 would require FERC to create an expedited licensing process for closed-loop pumped storage projects within 2 years of receiving a completed application. FERC would also be required to issue a rule establishing the new process within 180 days of this bill's enactment.  Mr.Speaker, in order to ensure local stakeholder input and collaboration, FERC will establish an interagency task force representing Federal and State agencies, as well as Native American Tribes, that would coordinate the authorizations needed to license the facility.  H.2880, Mr.Speaker, would also direct FERC to evaluate the safety of any dam or other existing structure that would be associated with a project and specify that potential projects could not cause significant changes to surface and groundwater uses or adversely impact threatened or endangered species.  Mr.Speaker, H.2880 would, for the first time, allow additional entities, including private partners, to join as co-licensees with municipalities in order to take advantage of the municipal preference. That preference would continue for such a private-public partnership even at the point that the municipality does not retain a majority interest in the project.  H.2880, Mr.Speaker, also mandates FERC to hold a workshop and issue guidance within 6 months of enactment to assist license applicants for closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine sites. Mr.Speaker, this provision would allow for these abandoned mines, many of which may already have the infrastructure in place to accommodate these projects, to be repurposed, potentially putting unemployed mining communities back to work.  So, Mr.Speaker, H.2880 is a much-needed, bipartisan, critical piece of legislation that would help to increase the number of low-carbon hydropower projects, while also taking into account the needs and interests of impacted local stakeholders. I strongly support this bill, Mr.Speaker, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.

832,topic-id,2300,"Mr.President, as everybody knows, the Republican Party now controls the U.House, the U.Senate, and the White We also know that unless a budget agreement is reached by December 22, the U.Government will shut down, which will cause serious harm to our country, including the men and women in the Armed Forces and our veterans.  I do not know why the Republican Party, which controls all the branches of government, wants to shut down our government. I think that is wrong, and I think a shutdown will be very hurtful to people from coast to coast.  Earlier this year, President Trump tweeted: ``Our country needs a good shutdown.'' I strongly disagree. I don't think we need a good shutdown; I think we need to reach an agreement on a budget that works for the middle class of our country and not just the wealthiest people.  It is no great secret that we are living in a nation that has almost unprecedented income and wealth inequality, at least since the 1920s. We have the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.  I don't believe that now is the time to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country in a horrific tax bill and then at the end of 10 years raise taxes on 83 million middle-class families. I think that makes no sense. I don't think it makes much sense to be passing a tax bill that gives 62 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent.  Apparently it is not good enough for my Republican colleagues that corporate America today is enjoying recordbreaking profits and that the CEOs of large corporations are earning more than 300 times what their employees make. What the tax bill would do is give over $1 trillion in tax breaks to large, profitable corporations at a time when already one out of five of these major corporations is paying nothing in taxes. That is apparently not good enough--we need to lower taxes for large corporations even more.  Right now as we speak, legislation is being written behind closed doors by the House Freedom Caucus and other Members of the extreme rightwing to provide a massive increase in funding for the Pentagon for the rest of the fiscal year, while only providing temporary and inadequate funding for the needs of the working families of this country, including education, affordable housing, nutrition, environmental protection, and other vital programs.  What we have seen over the last year is a Republican effort to throw 30 million people off of health insurance. What we then see is a Republican effort to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large corporations and at the end of 10 years raise taxes on middle-class families. Now what we are seeing on the part of the Republican Party is an effort to increase military spending by $54 billion while ignoring the needs of a struggling middle class. We have to get our priorities right and maybe--just maybe--we have to start listening to what the American people want, not just what wealthy campaign contributors want.  In terms of the Republican so-called healthcare bill, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, there is massive opposition from the American people. In terms of this tax bill, in case you haven't seen the last few polls, there is massive opposition to a tax bill that gives incredible tax breaks to people who don't need it and raises taxes on the middle class. Maybe--just maybe--we should start paying attention to the needs of working families.  For a start, let us be clear that since the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, Democrats and Republicans have agreed to operate with parity, which means if you are going to increase military spending, you increase programs that meet the needs of working families, domestic spending. There was parity in 2011 and parity three times after, and parity must continue. It is not acceptable to be talking about a huge increase in military spending and not funding the needs of a shrinking middle class, which desperately needs help in terms of education, in terms of nutrition, and so many other areas.  Furthermore, the American people are quite clear that they want us to move toward comprehensive immigration reform. They understand that it would be a terrible, terrible, terrible thing to say to the 800,000 young people who have lived, in most cases, their entire lives in the United States of America: We are ending the DACA You are going to lose your legal status. You are not going to be able to go to school. You are not going to be able to hold a job. You are not going to be able to be in the military. We are taking away the legal status that you now have, and you will be subject to deportation. That is not what the American people want. They want to continue the DACA Program, and, in fact, they want comprehensive immigration reform--and now. Now is the time to deal with that.  I am happy to say that on this issue, there are a growing number of Republicans in the House and in the Senate who understand that in America, you are not going to throw 800,000 of our brightest young people, who are serving in the military and holding important jobs, out of this country by withdrawing their legal status.  I have been deeply involved, as have Senator Blunt and others, in the Community Health Center Program, which is so important for the people of our country. Twenty-seven million Americans today receive their healthcare through community health centers, which provide primary care, provide mental health counseling--so important today--provide dental care, and provide low-cost prescription drugs. While my Republican colleagues have been busy trying to throw 30 million people off of health insurance, while they have been busy trying to give a trillion dollars in tax breaks for the rich and for large corporations, somehow they have not had the time to extend the CHIP program or the Community Health Center How in God's Name can we be talking about tax breaks for billionaires and not extending a health insurance program for the children of our country? If the CHIP program is not reauthorized, 9 million children and working families will lose their health insurance.  Let us get our priorities right. Let us immediately pass legislation extending and funding the CHIP program and the Community Health Center Program.[[Page S7959]]  In the Midwest, as you well know, and all over this country, we have a major crisis in terms of pensions. So many of our older workers are scared to death about retiring because they have very little or nothing in the bank as they end their work careers. If Congress does not act soon, the earned pension benefits of more than 1.5 million workers and retirees in multiemployer pension plans could be cut by up to 60 percent. People who have worked their entire lives, people who have put money into a pension program, people who have given up wage increases in order to gain decent pensions now stand the possibility of seeing their pensions cut by up to 60 percent. How can we do that? How do you tell someone who has worked their entire life, who is looking forward to a decent retirement, that we are going to cut their pension by up to 60 percent? We cannot do that. When a worker is promised a pension benefit after a lifetime of hard work, that promise must be kept. Congress needs to act before the end of the year to make sure that no one in America in a multiemployer pension plan will see their pension cut. Yes, I also think that is more important than tax breaks for billionaires.  We need to make a downpayment on universal childcare. In my State of Vermont and all over this country, it is increasingly difficult for working families to find high-quality, affordable childcare. We must, in my view, double the funding for the Childcare and Development Block Grant to provide childcare assistance for 226,000 more children and move toward universal childcare for every kid in What the social sciences tell us is that there is no better investment than early childhood education. Every dollar we invest there is paid back many times over by kids doing better at school and by kids getting out, getting jobs, and becoming taxpayers.  There is another crisis in this country that has to be dealt with. Ten years ago, Congress passed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to support Americans who enter public service careers--teachers, nurses, firefighters, police officers, social workers, and military personnel. One of the absurdities that exists in America today is that we have tens of millions of Americans who are paying outrageous interest rates on their student debt. People who have done the right thing by trying to get the best education they could are now being punished because they went to college, went to graduate school, and are having to pay a significant part of their income back to the government in terms of their student debt. Congress must address this issue, and there is legislation to make sure that, at the very least, if you are prepared to go into public service work--if you want to be a teacher, a nurse, a firefighter, a police officer, a social worker, or want to go into the military--we will forgive your debt. That is an issue that should be dealt with before the end of the year.  We have a crisis in terms of our rural infrastructure, and I come from a rural In the year 2017, soon to be 2018, how does it happen that in rural communities all over America there are inadequate broadband capabilities? How do you start a small business in a small town if you don't have good-quality broadband? How do the kids do well in school if they can't gain access to the internet? This is the United States of America, and we should not be trailing countries all over the world that have better broadband access at lower costs than we do. If we want to grow rural America, if we want our kids to stay in rural America, we have to deal with the collapsing infrastructure in this country, especially in rural  Mr.President, I don't have to tell you--because Ohio has been hit hard, as has Vermont, New Hampshire, and all over this country--that we have a terrible, terrible epidemic in terms of opioid addiction. I am trying to deal with this issue in the State of Vermont, and I know it is severe in We have to be adequately funding programs that focus on prevention, making sure that our young people do not get trapped into a life of addiction. We have to provide the kinds of treatment people need. We cannot ignore this. This is an epidemic that is sweeping this country. More people will die this year from opioid overdoses than died during the entire war in We have to adequately fund treatment and prevention for the epidemic that we are seeing in terms of opioids.  We ought to keep our promises to our veterans. We now have tens of thousands of positions at the Veterans Administration that have not been filled, and we need to make sure they are filled so that the veterans of our country, when they go into the VA, get high-quality care in a timely manner, which they are entitled to.  There was an article, I think it was in the Washington Post, a couple of weeks ago that talked about the fact that 10,000 people died in the last year, waiting for a decision on Social Security disability benefits. In other words, you have people who desperately need these benefits; they have applied for these benefits through the Social Security Administration, and they wait and they wait and they wait. Unbelievably, in the last year, 10,000 people died while they were waiting for a decision from the Social Security This has everything to do with the fact that there have been budget cuts in recent years that have been significant and have resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 employees in the Social Security Administration, the closing of 64 field offices, and reduced hours in many others. In Vermont, one field office has seen its staffing cut by 30 percent. We have to adequately fund the Social Security Administration so that our elderly and our disabled can get due process in terms of the benefits for which they have filed.  In 2016, the National Park Service recorded over 330 million visits to national parks and over $11 billion in deferred maintenance. In other words, our national parks are very, very popular, but they are not getting the maintenance work they need. Meanwhile, the President wants to double fees for people visiting our beautiful national parks. This is an issue we must deal with.  The bottom line is that we are coming toward the end of the year, and we have a lot of work to do, but the work we do has to start reflecting the needs of the working people of this country, not just the billionaire class. We cannot give $54 billion more to the military and ignore the needs of our children, our elderly, our sick, our poor. We have to come up with a budget proposal that works for all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors. As a member of the Budget Committee, I expect to be very active in that process.

531,topic-id,581,"Mr.Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment to H.1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency  I would like to thank my colleague from Texas, Judge Poe, for joining me in this effort.  Iran is a bad and dangerous actor in a volatile region of the world, which is why Congress has enacted sanctions in response to Tehran's dangerous ballistic missile program and support for terrorist proxy groups, including We must hold senior Iranian leadership accountable for destabilizing actions in the region and around the world.  The legislation on the floor today is an effort to shine a light and focus our[[Page H9877]]efforts on assets held by top Iranian officials, including the Supreme Leader, members of the Council of Guardians, members of the Expediency Council, and high-ranking military leaders.  Specifically, the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress information on the assets held by senior Iranian leaders. Included in this report are recommendations on how to improve the effectiveness of U.sanctions to prevent these assets and funding from being used by Iranian officials to further develop Iran's ballistic missile program.  My amendment simply, but importantly, expands this requirement to include Iran's human rights abuses. We should be using every tool in our toolbox to make clear to Iran that its human rights abuses are unacceptable.  The human rights situation in Iran is appalling, and abuses permeate many aspects of Iranian society. In Iran, repression and persecution of members of different religious faiths, including Sunni Muslims, Christians, and Baha'is is pervasive. The State Department's International Religious Freedom Report of 2016 cites at least 103 members of minority religious groups imprisoned for their religious activities. Since 1979, Iran has executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders and, over the past 10 years, has conducted more than 850 arbitrary arrests of Baha'i individuals.  Sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected categories from discrimination under Iranian law, and same-sex acts are punishable by flogging and possibly even death.  Arbitrary and unlawful killings are numerous. The State Department's annual Human Rights Report says the Iranian Government announced 114 executions by August of 2016 and that unofficial reports suggest a total of 469 executions by the end of that year. The U.puts this number even higher at 530 executions in 2016.  Freedom of speech is limited, media is censored, and publications have been banned and closed by the government. Harassment and detainment of journalists continue, and Iran's citizens are not allowed to criticize the government, Supreme Leader, or official religion.  The electoral system in Iran is neither free nor fair.

For my Republican colleagues, apparently that means cutting tax rates for the wealthy even more than the original bill, as we have heard over the last couple days.  Where is the fairness for average, hardworking Americans?  Medical expenses are no longer deductible.  Student loans and tuition waivers are no longer deductible.  Interest is not deductible for families, but it is for business.  The mortgage interest deduction is reduced.  State and local taxes are not fully deductible.  Small businesses don't get the same tax cuts that big businesses do.  No help for capital gains.  No help for dividends, advertising, or entertaining.  Other business expense is no longer deductible.  Renewable energy tax credits go away.  Private activity bonds that help veterans and many others are also gone.

2,topic-id,331,"Mr.President, on a different subject, I again warn about the danger of the smear campaign against Special Counsel  Over the weekend, allies of the President in the media escalated their phony attacks on Special Counselor Mueller to an outrageous degree. One of the assertions that arose this weekend was that Special Counsel Mueller improperly obtained emails from the Trump transition team. This is a bald-faced lie. There is no proof behind the allegations. There is no substance behind the allegations. They can't point to any indication that Mueller's team did anything that was improper, let alone illegal. The Mueller team is allowed to request whatever it wants. They are special counsel, special prosecutors. They either have to get the accountholder's permission or go[[Page S8053]]through appropriate criminal processes. In this case, there is no indication that they didn't follow the guidelines.  So to those complaining here in the Congress and in the media, point to something specific that Mueller did wrong here.  They can't. These attackers are creating impropriety when there is none. Their attacks are not based on fact or logic. This is a hatchet job, plain and simple. If they have a legal complaint, they can pursue it in court, but of course they don't. That is why these attacks are only speculation on TV by partisan pundits.  Robert Mueller is one of the most respected and trusted civil servants in our country. His integrity is unimpeachable. The concerted campaign to discredit him and his investigation in the rightwing media is nothing more than propaganda and disinformation to try to turn the public's attention away from the real investigation--Donald Trump's potential collusion with Russia and the collusion of his campaign and the attempt, if it is found, to obstruct justice and prevent an investigation from going forward.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will defend the special counsel from these spurious attacks.

It will lead to a better bipartisan result, which is a necessity. To try to do it in a partisan way, as the House of Representatives seems to be doing, will lead to nowhere and to a government shutdown. Instead of jamming through a partisan tax scam in the House and Senate, we should be working on middle-class priorities.  To make matters worse, House Republicans continue to waste time on a partisan CRomnibus that is dead on arrival in the There is another path. Republicans and Democrats should continue to negotiate a genuine bipartisan agreement that paves the way for the major unresolved issues to get to the President's desk. With so little time left before the end of the year, those negotiations must proceed in earnest. They haven't been.  Today, in the House, the Republican Members of the team called off the negotiations and said: Let's do it tomorrow--as the clock ticks.  A few items have become sticking points and should be addressed. We still don't have a deal on pensions. Over 1 million Americans are waiting for our Republican friends to do what is right and work with us on a solution to the pension crisis in These working people every month put money into a pension hoping that when they retire, they are not going to become rich, but they can live a life of dignity. A lot of that has been robbed from them. We have an obligation to help them. That is a high priority for Democrats in the Senate and the  We still don't have a resolution on Democratic funding requests for opioid treatment. We know the scourge of opioids, the number of deaths throughout America--rural, suburban, urban, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, everybody. In the flower of their youth, so many are being taken by opioids. We don't do enough, and there is a clamor from the Nation to do more.  What about veterans' care? Cuts have hurt our veterans who have served us. They are not getting the help they need.  Our infrastructure is crumbling. We need help in rural areas, urban areas, suburban areas. What about that?  There is no resolution on adequate funding for Puerto Rico and its resiliency or the Virgin Islands, no resolution on fixing our wildfire funding problem which we proposed.  We still don't have an understanding on the Republicans' plan to extend the 702 FISA Court program. The majority leader has told us: Oh, we have to act on He could put it on the floor today. He could have put it on the floor last week, instead of putting three judges--some of whom had dubious credentials--on the floor. So to tell us we are running out of time for FISA, when the majority leader controls the floor and hasn't done anything for months, rings a little hollow.  We still don't have a good deal on the healthcare package. Now that Republicans are pushing through a partisan repeal of the individual mandate in their tax bill, which causes premiums to rise 10 percent--when America gets those premium increases this spring and summer, they will know who to blame. The number of Americans without insurance will rise by 13 million. The bipartisan stabilization bills will not have the same impact. We will need new legislation to account for the Republicans' latest attempt to undermine our healthcare system.  We still don't have a disaster package that adequately takes care of Puerto Rico, California, the Virgin I hear that my friends from Texas--both Houses--are demanding we rush through a partisan disaster package through the end of the year. Texas needs the money, but the Governor of Texas has refused to tap the State's $10 billion rainy day fund--the largest in the country--to help Houston and other parts of the State recover from Hurricane Yet, at the same time, he is demanding immediate Federal assistance. On its face, it is absurd. It is an absurd position for a routine critic of Federal Government spending to demand money immediately, while he has a $10 billion fund sitting there. Imagine if those moneys were in New York or Maryland what our Republican colleagues would be saying. Constantly, we have this what is good for the goose is not good for the gander on our Republican side. I could have used stronger words, but I stopped myself.  I say to the Governor of Texas: If a rainy day fund is not for a rainy day, which Texas had, then what the heck is it for? I, for one, don't want to vote for a nickel for Texas unless they tap that rainy day fund.  Of course, last, but certainly not least, we have to ensure protection for the Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing in the House and That is good news. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House are trying to come to an agreement on helping the Dreamers, who just want to become Americans, and coming up with border security which we all believe we need. One thousand Dreamers are losing their status every week. While our Republican friends twiddle their thumbs, we need action on the Dreamers, and we need our Republican colleagues to cooperate.  On these issues and more, there is a lot of work left to do. Instead of rushing through their partisan tax bill, I would urge my Republican colleagues to focus on the year-end negotiations.  Speaking of the tax bill, it appears it will be before us on a final vote early this week. Although there were significant changes in the conference report, Senators will not have much time to grapple with them. The conference report was released late last We are taking a final vote on a bill that will change the entire Tax Code only a few days later. It will be a culmination of the sloppiest legislative process I have witnessed in my time as a Fittingly, unfortunately, the results will be a mess as well.  My Republican friends are squandering their so-called once-in-a-generation opportunity for tax reform on a massive corporate bailout paid for by middle-class tax increases. What a shame.  At a time when our economy is increasingly stacked against the middle class and in favor of the wealthy, the Republican tax bill will skew the playing field even further out of whack. It will explode inequality in the country,[[Page S8054]]where the top 1 percent of earners already capture over 20 percent of the national income, while the bottom 50 percent take in only 13 percent. It will explode the deficit, starving our country of the resources it needs to invest in education, infrastructure, and scientific research--all the things that help the middle class.  After all of that, it will endanger Social Security, Medicaid, and Then, 1 or 2 or 3 years down the line, Republicans will come back to slash those programs to pay for the deficit they have created.  Finally, our Republican friends say: Well, it will create a whole lot of jobs. Give money to the wealthiest corporations. As has been shown over and over again, the wealthiest corporations have a ton of money right now. They are not creating jobs. Give them more money? They will not create any more jobs. The only claim our Republican colleagues have for the middle class is trickle-down. Well, my friends, no one believes in trickle-down except for a handful of wealthy, greedy people who seem to be controlling what you are saying and doing in this tax bill.  This bill, in short, is a cynical one-two gut punch to the middle class. It raises middle-class taxes to pay for corporate tax cuts and decimates their earned benefits as a kicker. Surely we can do better than this.  Tomorrow Republicans will have a chance to vote down this tax bill, which is one of the least popular pieces of legislation in the last 30 years. My Republican colleagues have accomplished an amazing trick. A tax cut, usually popular, is 2-to-1 unpopular in Good work.  They know what is in it. The public knows. They know they are getting crumbs, if anything, and many are getting increases, while the highest income people do great. Well, let me just say, if by some miracle, our Republican colleagues get the good sense to vote this package down and really help the middle class instead of just helping the wealthy, we Democrats will be there. They will find a Democratic leader and a Democratic Party willing to work with them on real bipartisan tax reform.

56,topic-id,487,"Mr.President, on another sad note and before I move to the substance of the day, I want to spend a moment in recognizing a dear friend of mine who passed away this weekend, Bob Wilmers, one of the most respected and prominent benefactors in Buffalo, NY--one of the great cities in my State and in our country.  Very few men had done as much for Buffalo since its founding hundreds of years ago as Bob Wilmers had done for the last several decades. He was the chairman of M&T He helped the bank grow from a small bank into one of the largest employers in the region--6,500 employees. As he built the business and created thousands of good-paying, middle-class jobs, he helped Upstate New York dramatically.  M&T Bank was a large bank, but it was not one of these banks that engaged in swaps overseas or other risky types of investments. It lent money to small businesses, and it had a deep caring for the communities which it served. It was a model bank, in my opinion. It did an amazing job in helping to revitalize our upstate economy, which has had trouble over the last several decades due to so many different things, including bad trade policies.  Bob was also not just committed to the bank, which he loved, as he loved the employees, cared about them, and was such an honorable employee; he was also committed to Buffalo and philanthropy. He directed almost $5 million to local nonprofit organizations in New York--the bank did under his leadership. That is because Bob himself was a philanthropist. He was a man with a big heart, and he always gave in every way. He spent many years supporting one of the great art museums in America, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, just to name a couple. He was a booster to everything He was never in the camp that thought Buffalo's best days were behind her. He always believed in Buffalo's potential and its future and helped to make that happen. The city of Buffalo is turning around. We are so proud in so many different ways. It is, in good part, because of Bob  On a personal level, my wife and I will miss him. He visited my wife for lunch a few months ago. He was 83 years old, and he was on his rickety, old bike and rode through the streets of New York City to meet her so that they could have lunch.  Bob's wife Elisabeth and Iris and I spent many happy hours together. He was a brilliant man, a brilliant banker, decent, caring, and civic-minded. The loss is the Wilmers family's, and our condolences go to It is a loss for Buffalo and the United Bob will be truly missed.

290,topic-id,735,"Mr.President, last week, the House and Senate passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government open as Republican and Democratic negotiators continue to work on a long-term spending deal. The negotiations are advancing well, but many issues remain to be resolved.  First and foremost, we must resolve the issue of the spending caps. If we do nothing, there will be painful and unnecessary cuts to both defense spending and programs that invest directly in jobs and economic development for the middle class in early We must lift the spending caps for defense and also those urgent domestic priorities in equal measure. That has been the basis of the successful budget agreements going back several years and as recently as April of this year. There was parity between defense and nondefense, and that is how it ought to stay. That is what brought us home to a good agreement and no shutdowns in previous years.  As the opioid crisis continues to rage, dimming the bright future of so many Americans, we have a moral obligation to step up our country's support for addiction treatment and recovery. I have had a father cry in my arms because his son was online waiting to get into a treatment program, but it was too crowded. He had to wait, and his son died of an overdose before he could get in. We can't have that in  So many of our young people, the flower of our youth, are dying or being hurt so badly, addicted, with this opioid crisis. We cannot sit by, just as we cannot sit by with foreign threats that plague our country.  As veterans continue to struggle to find the quality healthcare they deserve after bravely serving this Nation, we should be making additional investments in veterans' healthcare and veterans hospitals. Just as we need to help[[Page S7951]]our soldiers abroad, we need to help those who have fought for us, risked their lives for us, and now have healthcare problems.  As hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of miners, truckdrivers, construction workers, and food service workers approach retirement age, we have to make sure the pension plans promised to them have enough in the bank to fulfill that promise. These people painstakingly paid every month into their plans, and so did their employers. They would forgo larger salary increases so they could make sure they are taken care of when they retire.  Now that the pension funds--in good part because of the crash of 2008--don't have the money they need, these people should not be left out. Hard-working American families deserve to retire with the dignity and security they have earned. If we don't meet these pension obligations today, they are going to cost the government a whole lot more tomorrow. That is why Democrats are fighting for a pension solution in the year-end spending bill.  These are all urgent priorities. There are more. They can't wait another day, just as we must make sure our men and women in uniform have the resources and support they need to do their job. Let's do both in a bipartisan way.  As Democrats continue to push for desperately needed funding to combat the opioid crisis, improve veterans' healthcare, and shore up pension plans, we will also be pushing to reauthorize CHIP--the Children's Health Insurance Program--and community health centers, as well as dealing with certain healthcare programs that have expired.  We have to do more for the Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands who are still recovering from devastating natural disasters.  We are in the process of negotiating with Republicans to provide a significant investment in border security in exchange for These talks continue to progress, and I am hopeful we can reach an agreement on that issue as well.  We have a lot to get done before the end of the year. We don't have much time to do it, but with the concerted effort of both parties, negotiating in good faith, I believe we can reach an agreement acceptable not to every Member of either Chamber but to large numbers of Members on both sides of the aisle so we can pass our agreement by a wide margin.

699,topic-id,1439,"Madam President, as we know, last night a Democrat won in the State of Alabama for the first time in a quarter century.  Last night's election of Doug Jones was not only the repudiation of a candidate unfit to serve in this body; it was an affirmation of a candidate who represents the very best of public service.  I read Doug Jones' bio. One story stands out in my mind. As a second-year law student, Doug Jones skipped class to attend the trial of the Klansman ringleader of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church--an event, as we all remember, that shook the conscience of our country and helped launch a mighty movement for civil rights. Although a young Doug Jones was moved by the disposition of justice in that trial, he was left with the impression that other members of the conspiracy had escaped the reach of the law. So 24 years later, when Doug Jones became the U.attorney in Alabama, he pursued charges against two more Klan members involved in the bombing, winning their conviction, and delivered a long-delayed but mighty righteous justice.  Doug Jones deserved to win the race last night. He is a fine man, was an excellent candidate, and is going to make an outstanding Senator for the people of I congratulate Senator-Elect Jones and look forward to welcoming him to this Chamber and our caucus.  Two additional points in regard to the election, which has a link to the Chamber here:  First, the election of a Democrat in such a conservative State, which hadn't had a Democratic Senator since 1996--they elected one in 1990, I guess--is a clarion call for bipartisanship. The American people are clamoring for us to work together, to eschew the politics of divisiveness and once again conduct our politics with civility, decency, and an eye toward compromise. That is what Doug Jones represented as a candidate, it is what he campaigned on, and his election should signal to all of my Republican colleagues that the American people, from the deepest red States to the deepest blue States, yearn for our politics to function again in a bipartisan way.  The election of a Democrat in such a conservative State is a clarion call for bipartisanship. The people of Alabama have spoken, and they have sent a message asking both Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve our greatest challenges. That is how Doug Jones campaigned. Roy Moore did not try to pursue any scintilla of bipartisanship, and it might have been one of the reasons he lost, particularly in the suburbs of Birmingham and other cities. I hope we in this body will take this election in earnest and pursue a course of bipartisanship.                          Republican Tax Bill  The election of Doug Jones should have another effect on this Chamber as well. It would be unseemly and imprudent to rush a massive piece of partisan legislation through this Chamber before Doug Jones is seated. To rush such a huge piece of legislation when the people of Alabama have just sent us a new Senator and try to jam it through before he gets here would be so wrong. Doug Jones will be the duly elected Senator from the State of Alabama in a few short weeks. The Governor didn't appoint him. The people chose him. It would be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected Senator from Alabama the opportunity to cast his vote. The people of Alabama deserve to have their representative in the Senate to debate the biggest issues of the day, and the tax bill certainly falls under that category.  Today, we Senate Democrats are calling on Leader McConnell to hit pause on his tax bill and not hold a final vote on it until Doug Jones is sworn into the That is exactly what Republicans argued when Scott Brown was elected in 2010. Referring to healthcare, Leader McConnell said it would be ``gamesmanship'' to pursue big-ticket legislation before Scott Brown was seated. He asked us to ``honor the wishes of the people of Massachusetts.'' Leader Reid, in fact, acceded to that wish and waited until Scott Brown was a Senator before there were any further votes on healthcare. ``We're going to wait until the new senator arrives until we do anything more on healthcare,'' he said.  As too often has happened, Senator McConnell does one thing when Republicans are in charge and a different thing when Democrats are in charge. Here is another example. McConnell says: New Senator--in that case, Scott Brown--slow down work on major legislation, and Reid acceded.  We are calling on Senator McConnell to do the same thing today. Let's see if he does. We are calling on Senator McConnell to do just as Senator Reid did--to honor the wishes of the people of a State that has newly elected a Senator and to wait to move forward on the tax bill until Senator Jones arrives.  If Republicans insist on barreling ahead--and I understand the pressure is on them from their hard-right multibillionaire paymasters--they will be pouring gasoline on the fire. Their tax bill--written in back rooms, rushed through this Chamber with such recklessness--which gives enormous breaks to the wealthy and corporations while it raises taxes on millions, many of them in the middle class, is being roundly rejected by the American people. Poll after poll shows by ratios equal to, a little less than, or a little more than two to one that the American people reject this bill. They know what is in it. They don't know all of the details, but they know it favors the wealthy and powerful over them, over the middle class. They know that, even if they are getting a small tax break, the vast majority of the tax breaks go to the wealthiest and the most powerful, and they don't like it. Above all, they know this tax bill will clobber the suburbs, drastically cutting back on the State and local deductions and other deductions they cut back on, which will be a gut punch to millions of middle-class and upper middle-class Americans who live in the suburbs. They are the very same people who are turning away from President Trump, who helped to propel Doug Jones to victory last night, and who helped to propel Mr.Northam to be Governor of Virginia when his opponent Gillespie was calling for a $10,000 tax break for the middle class.  The longer this bill sits behind closed doors, the worse it is getting. Rather than improving it for the middle class, they are cutting the rate further on the wealthiest of Americans, according to all reports--to reduce the top rate another 2.5 percent, only going to people who make over $300,000 a year, while raising taxes on the middle class. What is going on in the heads of our Republican colleagues? Why would they do something that seems so wrong for America and so against what the American people want? We know why. The Koch brothers and the Club for Growth, funded largely by billionaires and millionaires, and all these other groups are fanatic: Just cut taxes on the rich.  I don't even hear them arguing for helping the middle class, except in TV ads that are deceptive, in my judgment. But they are doing it for that[[Page S7982]]reason. Our Republican colleagues, by trying to appease these very wealthy people--a small number of greedy people--are writing their political doom, in my opinion.  The longer this bill sits behind closed doors, the worse it is getting. It is not improving things for the middle class. It is making them worse. Instead of learning from their mistakes, instead of heeding one of the lessons of the election last night, Republicans are doubling down on helping the wealthy and powerful and doing nothing for, if not harming, the middle class.

1052,topic-id,2309,"Mr.President, on the year-end negotiations, they are making headway--that is good--but many issues still remain to be resolved.  We need to provide funding for community health centers, CHIP, and areas that have been hit by disasters. We need to pass a bipartisan deal to pair the Dream Act with border security and pass a budget deal that fully funds both our national security and our economic security, in the common parlance known as ``parity.''  If we don't lift the spending caps for defense and also urgent domestic priorities--jobs, the economy--both will come under the specter of sequestration. Lifting those spending caps in equal measure has been the basis of successful budget agreements going back several years.  There has been parity between defense and nondefense for the last three[[Page S8019]]budget negotiations. That is how it ought to stay. That is what brought us to good agreements. That is what averted shutdowns. Unfortunately, it appears that the Freedom Caucus in the House, which doesn't represent the mainstream of America or even the mainstream of Republicans, is trying to derail another successful parity agreement. Unfortunately, Speaker Ryan, as he is doing far too often, to the detriment of the country and his party, is just following its lead.  Last night, the House posted what is called a CRomnibus--a very short-term extension of funding for jobs and economic development that will lead to cuts in those areas but a long-term extension and a large increase of funding for defense. This is merely a ruse that is designed to slash funding for education, healthcare, infrastructure, and scientific research--all things the Freedom Caucus doesn't want the government to fund--against the will of the overwhelming majority of  At this late hour, it is also an unfortunate waste of precious time. Earlier this week, 44 Senate Democrats sent a letter to our Republican colleagues that explicitly warned them that Democrats could not support such an approach. Because 60 votes are needed to advance a spending bill here in the Senate, House Republicans should have known not to waste everyone's time with a partisan spending bill that could never pass in the  The CRomnibus is nothing but a spectacle--a charade, a sop--to some militant, hard-right people who don't want the government to spend money on almost anything. It is a perilous waste of time as the clock ticks closer and closer to the end of the year.  It is time for our Republican colleagues--especially in the House, where the Freedom Caucus is like the tail wagging the dog--to get serious about working with Democrats toward a real parity agreement. Every hour that the House spends on the CRomnibus is an hour that could be spent on our working on a deal to avert a shutdown and solve the many pressing issues that Congress must grapple with before the end of the year.  If Speaker Ryan decides to press forward with a CRomnibus, it will quickly fail in the Senate, and we can get back to negotiating a real bipartisan agreement that will provide certainty and full funding to both our national defense and the middle class. Speaker Ryan has gone along with this approach three times in a row--or the House Republicans have. I think Ryan was the Speaker for two of those three and was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for the third. Right now, Speaker Ryan is pursuing a dead-end strategy. Instead, we urge him to continue working with Democrats on a bipartisan, long-term agreement that will keep the government open and fund our major priorities--defense, with jobs and the economy on the other side.  By the way, even on the other side of the ledger, the things that affect our security, like the border and the FBI, are funded on the nondefense side, and you have to have security in every way in this terrorism-ridden world in which we live.                          Republican Tax Bill  Mr.President, a word on the Republican tax bill. On both process and substance, it appears that the Republicans' conference committee is making all the mistakes that the Republicans made when they passed their bill in the first place. Even though there is still not a final agreement on the text of the tax bill, Republican leaders promise a vote on the committee report as early as Monday of next week. I am not sure that my colleagues will have had enough time to have read and digested the bill that passed this Chamber a few weeks ago, let alone an entirely new conference report that will include many changes. It is the same rushed, awful process as before, and it can only result in mistakes and unintended consequences that could wreak havoc on the economy. Why are our Republican colleagues rushing this bill through? I think that they are ashamed of it.  Every day, the more people know about the bill, the more they don't like it. Just in the polling data today, it shows that the popularity of the bill continues to plummet, and a poll out today said it is not just that the people do not like the bill but that those who vote for it will be affected at election time. The poll today asked people if they were more or less likely to vote for a Congressman who would vote for this bill or to vote for a Senator who would vote for this bill. Many in the public said that they were less likely to vote for a Congressman who would vote for this awful bill. The public knows that it is awful. Why? They know that Republicans are doubling down in this new proposal on the core mistake of their bill by tilting it even further in favor of the wealthy.  I saw on TV this morning a guy from the Club for Growth and a guy from--I forgot the name--another group. These are narrow, narrow groups that have very little support and that are funded by the hard-right group of billionaires who want to see their taxes cut. They don't even talk about what is in the bill. They try to talk about its being a job creator, but they dare don't say, like so many of my Republican colleagues, how disproportionately it goes to those in the upper incomes and not to the middle class.  Amazingly enough, behind closed doors, they have made a bad bill even worse. One of the most significant changes that have been made by the conference committee will be to lower the top tax rate 2 percentage points more than in the original bill. Let's help those millionaires get an even lower tax rate than they have now, for they are doing so poorly. This is crazy. There are a lot of wealthy people in God bless them. I don't resent their wealth, but they don't need a tax break. On the other hand, there are hundreds of millions of struggling middle-class people, and they could use that kind of money. Yet millions of people in this bill who are middle class, upper middle class, and who are struggling to be middle class get a tax increase. Instead of lowering the rate on the highest income people, why not use the money to help those in the middle?  Despite all of the concerns about raising middle-class taxes, which makes the bill as unpopular as I just mentioned, the one big thing that Republicans go back and change is the rate paid by the wealthiest of They lower it. When it comes down to a choice between the middle class and the wealthy and the middle class and big corporations, the Republicans just instinctively, atavistically--in a knee-jerk way--choose the wealthy and the powerful over the middle class. That is why they are struggling.  I believe that is why President Trump's numbers are as low as they have ever been. People are getting a feel--a smell--in that President Trump talks about the middle class, but when he acts, like in this tax bill, it is to help the wealthiest and the most powerful. That happens with issue after issue.  I see that my colleague Dick Blumenthal, the Senator from Connecticut, has come to the floor. He is going to talk about net neutrality, I believe. Again, help the big cable companies and the corporations, and make it harder for the middle class when it comes to cable service and the cost of cable.  Republicans claim that lowering the top rate is an attempt to address tax hikes that would result from their plan to gut the State and local deduction, but reducing the top rate only helps the very wealthy--couples who make over $1 million in the last draft that we heard about--but they are already the prime beneficiaries of this tax plan.  I have a feeling that President Trump was hearing from his handful of wealthy friends who pay a lot in State and local taxes, many from my home State of New He decided, well, I will lower their taxes even more. But 99 percent of State and local deductions are taken by Americans with incomes under $1 million. More than half of the taxpayers who take the SALT deduction make less than $100,000. Reducing the top rate does nothing to help the 99 percent of taxpayers who take It only helps the top 1 percent, who make over $1 million. But this is what, it seems, the President and our Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate keep doing.  As I have said from the start, eliminating or cutting the State and local deduction would hurt the middle class across the country. It would raise taxes on millions, lower home values for millions more, and gut our State and local[[Page S8020]]programs--education, law enforcement, infrastructure. None of those programs were addressed in the conference. Instead, the richest Americans will likely get an even bigger tax break.  There is no reason to rush the bill through the  Tuesday night, as our Presiding Officer knows, we had an election in This Chamber is waiting for the seating of a new Shouldn't the people of Alabama have their voices in the Senate present for a vote on the tax bill?  Again I would say to my friend the majority leader, slow down and wait for Senator-Elect Jones to arrive before taking any more votes on the tax bill. Democrats waited for Republican Senator Scott Brown in 2010, but now that the shoe is on the other foot, Republicans don't seem to want to do the same. It is the right thing to do, and it will give every Senator and the American people more time to consider the legislation.                             Net Neutrality  Finally, Mr.President, a word on the FCC's vote today on net neutrality. We depend on a free and open internet to spur innovation and job creation. Our economy works best when innovators and entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes compete on a level playing field. Net neutrality, very simply, says that everyone deserves the same, fair access to the internet. Consumers, small businesses, students, everyone from the elderly couple using Skype to talk to their grandchildren who are half a country away, to the startup company operating out of its founder's basement--everyone deserves the same access to and quality of internet as the big corporations.  When I was growing up in Brooklyn, my father owned a small exterminating business. If his competitor down the street had received a preferred electricity rate, he would have rightly been outraged, and the law would have protected him from unfair treatment. We don't reserve certain highways for a single trucking company, and we don't limit phone service to handpicked stores. We shouldn't reserve high-speed internet for a favored few corporations either. Yet now President Trump's appointed Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is on the verge of eliminating net neutrality, which will bring to an end the free and open internet that has enabled so many successful companies and has created so many jobs.  Our internet is the envy of the world. Why are we changing it in a way that could harm it? If net neutrality is eliminated, the internet may resemble a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private fast lanes while the rest of us inch along on a single, traffic-choked public lane. We could be forced to purchase internet packages, much like cable packages, and pay for more popular sites. It is hard to imagine an entrepreneur building the world's next revolutionary, billion-dollar company while she sits in bumper-to-bumper traffic online. It is hard to imagine that average consumers are going to get a good deal if internet service providers are unshackled and offer premium service to premium customers.  Again, President Trump talks one way and acts another. He talks like he is helping the middle class. He is fully supportive of the FCC and his handpicked Chairman while he hurts the middle class and helps the big interests when it comes to the internet.  By ending net neutrality, Chairman Pai and the Trump administration are once again siding with corporate interests against consumers and small business. Once again, the Trump administration is picking CEOs over citizens--just as in the tax bill and now on net neutrality--and thwarting the comments of millions of Americans who have sent comments to the FCC asking them to save net neutrality and to keep the internet free and open to everyone.  The American people have spoken. I hope Chairman Pai and President Trump are listening.  Before I yield the floor, I want to thank my friend, the senior Senator from Connecticut, for his valiant and strong struggle to keep the internet free, open, and available to the little guy and gal equally as it is to the big shots.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-12-14-pt1-PgS8017-6.txt,1036,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,14.0,December

728,topic-id,1312,"Mr.President, I was interested to hear my colleague and friend from North Dakota talking about this tax bill because, sadly, there has not been a lot of bipartisan work on the bill.  I really agree there is a consensus that tax reform is it long overdue, but we need tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code, bolsters the middle class, and helps small businesses create jobs. I think those principles could have been the basis for really good bipartisan work here in the Senate, and in Congress, generally, to come up with a bill that would have done all of those things, but, unfortunately, the legislation in front of us does none.  The result is a partisan tax bill, written in secret and without public hearings, adds to the national debt, punishes the middle class and small businesses, and gives massive tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy.  Last week, I came to the floor to share the concerns of Granite Staters about this legislation. They were amplified at a forum I had on Monday at Southern New Hampshire University, where I heard from students, graduate students, and higher education leaders in the State about the damage this bill would do to our State and to our national economy.  I have heard some reports today that there will be changes that come out of the conference committee that may address some of the concerns about the bill's impact on education. I hope that is true. Unfortunately, I haven't heard what those changes are. I don't know if any Democrats here have heard what those changes are. Unfortunately, these negotiations, like the bill, are being done in secret, and the future of students and so many people in New Hampshire and the country hang in the balance.  In particular, what I heard at the forum with the students and educators was that the bill as it passed the House would raise taxes on New Hampshire students and would make it financially impossible for many of them to continue their educations.  As passed, the House tax bill would eliminate the ability of individuals to deduct the interest they pay on their student loan debt. Nationwide, student loan debt has roughly tripled since 2004 and now totals a staggering $1.3 trillion--more than the total credit card debt in the country. It is particularly burdensome for those of us in New Hampshire because New Hampshire's 2016 graduating class had the highest per capita student loan debt in the country--an average of $36,367.  The Republican leader's tax bill would make this crisis far worse not only for current students but for those who graduated many years ago but are still burdened by student loan debt. It would prevent nearly 80,000 Granite Staters from deducting interest on their student loans.  The House legislation would also make it far more expensive to get an advanced degree because it eliminates tax-free waivers for tuition assistance. I am hearing recent reports that this provision may be taken out of the final bill. I certainly hope that is the case because as currently written, it would put graduate school financially out of reach for many students.  A Dartmouth College student pursuing a Ph.in biomedical sciences wrote that counting tuition waivers as earned income would raise his yearly taxes by more than $10,000. He said he[[Page S8001]]would no longer be able to afford rent and groceries and would have to consider dropping out of school.  Ken Ferreira, the associate vice president for student financial services at Franklin Pierce University, told me, in no uncertain terms, that tuition waivers are not income, and it is wrong to tax them. I could not agree more.  Tyler Kane is pursuing a master's degree in environmental engineering at the University of New He told me he already owes close to $40,000 in student loans and works nearly 60 hours a week. After paying rent and other expenses, his stipend leaves him with less than $200 a month. If his tuition waiver becomes taxable, that would be a tax increase of $2,500, and it would wreck his budget, leaving him in a $33-a-month hole. Along with many of his graduate student colleagues, he would have to consider dropping out of school.  It makes no sense to increase the burden of student debt and to impose new taxes on graduate students struggling to get by so we can give the biggest corporations in this country and the wealthiest a tax cut.  It is estimated that by 2020, two-thirds of all jobs in the United States will require some form of higher education. Yet today less than 45 percent of Americans have at least a 2-year degree. As I talk with small business owners across New Hampshire, one of their biggest challenges is finding skilled workers. The last thing we need to do is make education more expensive and unaffordable for millions of young As one New Hampshire businessman told me, it is like eating our own seed corn. For the United States to stay competitive in the global economy, we can't afford to discourage talented young people from going to college or pursuing a graduate degree.  I also had the opportunity to talk with Nate He is pursuing a Ph.at the University of Because he serves as a teaching assistant, the university provides a tuition waiver of nearly $27,000, which would be taxed under the provision of the House bill. If his tuition waiver were taxed, that would force him to consider opting out of graduate school entirely.  I also heard from university administrators, who shared their concerns.  Sister Paula Marie Buley, president of Rivier University, pointed out that the proposed new taxes on students is ``a tax on our future.''  Jan Nesbit, the senior vice provost for research at the University of New Hampshire, warned that taxing graduate students' tuition waivers would have a cascading impact that would raise undergraduate tuition across the board because losing graduate students would affect both teaching assistants and research and drive up costs.  I heard from Cari Moorhead, the interim dean of the graduate school at the University of New She pointed out that many international students at UNH would be lost and noted that Canada has recently seen more than a 40-percent increase in international students. They are very pleased to be benefiting from the brain drain from the United States because of the financial barriers that we are putting up for graduate students.  The other damaging aspect of this legislation, which I think many people are not aware of, is that the tuition assistance that many companies provide to their employees would count as taxable income. Forty years ago, Congress provided employers with the flexibility to offer up to $5,250 in annual tax-free educational benefits to employees. This was designed to advance competitiveness and fill the need for more skilled workers. If we eliminate those benefits, how many of those employees who are looking to advance themselves through education will not be able to do that?  In so many ways, this tax overhaul legislation would take America backward, not forward. Tax reform should be about helping Americans prepare for the jobs of the 21st century; it shouldn't make it harder to afford college or graduate school. Tax reform should be about strengthening the middle class, not burdening it with higher taxes. Tax reform should be about growing the economy, not growing the deficits and the debt.  Like my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I am eager to work to genuinely reform the Tax Reform is long overdue, but the bill we have before us is not reform. We need a bipartisan bill that puts the middle class first, puts small businesses first, and doesn't leave a massive debt for our children and grandchildren.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

328,topic-id,523,"Mr.Speaker, this bill began with a proposal by Mr.Luetkemeyer of Missouri two Congresses ago. Last Congress, I introduced it, and now the gentlewoman from New York is carrying the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I wouldn't be here supporting this bill in any form if it undermined Dodd-Frank--I cosponsored Dodd-Frank--or if it undermined the CFPB, an institution that I think is very important and was created by Dodd- With the amendment that I am proposing, this bill goes back to the text that I introduced last year. That text came before the Financial Services Committee and secured the vote of all Republicans and 60 percent of the Now, you can't get all the votes all the time, but if you can get, for any particular draft, 100 percent of the Republicans and 60 percent of the Democrats on the committee, that, I think, is bipartisan legislation.  Now, the first part of this bill and, by far, the most important part deals with loans made by small institutions that would otherwise be required to have an impound account. An impound account is when the bank collects from you not only your mortgage payment but collects, every month, some money toward your property taxes and toward your insurance, and then the bank pays those bills for you.  Small institutions are not set up in order to keep track of how much property tax to collect and pay or fire and other homeowners insurance. They would rather rely on the borrower, somebody they know, to pay their fire insurance, to pay their property taxes.  Now, we can count on them to make sure that they are not giving this responsibility to somebody who can't handle it, because they are required, under this bill, to hold the mortgage for 3 years in their portfolio.  Keep in mind that the whole requirement only relates to the first 5 years. So here, they have to keep it in their portfolio for 3 years. This, I think, ensures that the bank or credit union or other small institution will make sure that the property taxes and property insurance are paid, while, at the same time, it won't take out of the market those small institutions that can't set up special impound accounts.  A second part of this bill deals with simply telling the CFPB to make whatever adjustments it thinks are appropriate for small institutions with regard to the small servicer exemption. That leaves that authority with the Under this amendment, the rule, whatever they decide to do for smaller institutions applies to those that are servicing not 30,000, but only 20,000 total loans, because it makes sense to have different, less complicated rules for smaller servicers.  So I don't think my amendment is sufficient to gain support for the bill from the ranking member. The bill in its amended form, it was sufficient to get 60 percent of the Democrats to vote for it in committee last year.

1107,topic-id,555,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill, H.4042. I would like to thank the gentleman from Montana and my colleague, the gentlewoman from Orlando, Florida, for their kind and historic words.  This bill would name the United States Post Office at 1415 West Oak Street in Kissimmee, Florida, after the 65th Infantry, also known as the Borinqueneers, named after the indigenous Taino word for Puerto Rico, ``Borinquen,'' which means, ``the land of the brave Lord,'' where the name of the Borinqueneers was derived from.  This was a segregated unit, one of only a few that we have in history, much like the heralded Tuskegee Airmen, and they fought for our country bravely even while facing discrimination and segregation. They quickly gained a well-deserved reputation as one of the 3rd Infantry's most reliable units.  Their bravery inspired General Douglas MacArthur, then the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, to write: ``The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry give daily proof on the battlefields of Korea of their courage, determination and resolute will to victory, their invincible loyalty to the United States and their fervent devotion to those immutable principles of human relations which the Americans of the continent and Puerto Rico have in common. They are writing a brilliant record of heroism in battle, and I am indeed proud to have to have them under my command. I wish that we could count on many more like them.''  I had the opportunity a couple of months ago to go to the demilitarized zone in Korea, and I thought, as I saw those hills and those mountains that were filled with trees and with forests again, about the stark difference that some of my constituents, whom I have gotten to speak with personally, saw there in There was nothing left but muddy, cold hills, freezing temperatures.

Obviously, we face other threats there. It reminded me of just how far they had gone and what they did, literally crossing the globe to make sure that our country was safe.  As the gentleman from Montana and the gentlewoman from Florida mentioned, we ultimately recognized that valor and the fact that they fought so bravely, even in the face of discrimination, on June 10, 2014--the Congressional Gold Medal, becoming the second Hispanic set of Americans here after Roberto Clemente received this award. Many folks who were born and raised on th island and served in Korea, in World War II, and ultimately in Vietnam after the unit was desegregated, now live in Kissimmee, Florida, and in central Florida, and are represented by many of us, including Congresswoman  This is a very important place to recognize a group of heroes who defied expectations and really cemented a legacy of heroism that all Americans can be proud of.

I want to make sure folks in Michigan get their $4,000 wage increase, and we don't get another bunch of promises with trickle-down economics, where everything goes to the top 1 percent, and folks in Michigan are still waiting for it to trickle down.                   CHIP and Community Health Centers  Mr.President, let me go to the subject I am here to talk about; that is, the fact that we are now on day 73 since the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health center funding has stopped. The Federal funding stopped on September 30.  I am very concerned. I was reading today that the House leadership has essentially been saying they don't want to see this continued as part of a year-end package in 2 weeks. My assumption was, we were going to see the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers wrapped into the bill in a couple of weeks that would set the priorities for our country.  If it is true what was reported, there ought to be an alarm going out all across the country. The Children's Health Insurance Program--which we call MIChild in Michigan--covers 9 million children across the country. These are working families. These are working families who need some help to have insurance for their children--children who now go to the doctor instead of an emergency room. This actually saves dollars by children being able to have a regular relationship with a doctor, parents knowing they can take their children to the doctor instead of having to figure out how to address their concerns in the middle of the night in the emergency room.  So 9 million children right now are at risk because of inaction. It has been 73 days. I am very concerned that as soon as February, the MIChild Program will be running out of funding. In fact, this month, there are three States that are losing funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program: Arizona, with over 88,000 children who receive health insurance and are able to go to the doctor. Their moms and dads know that at least the kids are going to be able to see the doctor for their juvenile diabetes, their asthma, or simple things like a cold, flu, or serious things like cancer.  New Hampshire has 17,000--almost 18,000 children. In Oregon, 140,000 children right now receive their healthcare through the Children's Health Insurance Starting in January, if there is no action, we will see millions of children losing their health insurance: California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Each month, we will see funding that will be eliminated. In total, we are talking about 9 million children.  This has been a bipartisan program. This came out of committee on a bipartisan vote in September with Senator Hatch and Senator I was pleased to join them in putting together a 5-year extension. It came out of committee with strong bipartisan support and only one ``no'' vote.  I assumed it was going to be brought up on the floor before September 30 and passed. Yet 73 days later, children and families across the country are still waiting.  The other piece of healthcare that has been so critical to families--to children and individuals across our country--is funding for community health centers, which, by the way, also has strong bipartisan support. Senator Roy Blunt and I have put in legislation with Republicans and Democrats cosponsoring it. We have a letter that 70 different Members signed to our leadership saying they support extending community health center funding. Yet, again, there has been no action for 73 days.  Our assumption had been that the Children's Health Insurance Program would come to the floor, we would amend it to add health centers, and get[[Page S7955]]it done before September 30. It has not happened. The community health centers serve 25 million patients in every part of our country. So 300,000 veterans rely on community health centers, and 7.5 million children, as well, rely on community health centers. I should add, we have 260 sites all across Michigan serving 681,000 people. Again, almost 13,000 Michigan veterans use our community health centers.  We have bipartisan support to continue funding, but the funding ended September 30. So what happens? Well, starting in January, Michigan's community health centers will lose $12.8 million in funding because about 70 percent of the funding for health centers comes through the legislation we are now offering with bipartisan support. About 20,000 people will lose their healthcare. By June, Michigan's health centers will lose over $80 million in funding, and almost 100,000 patients will lose healthcare. This is critically important as well. We are talking about 25 million people across the country.  Community health centers and the Children's Health Insurance Program is something we have come together on, on a bipartisan basis, over the years. There has to be a sense of urgency about this. We cannot leave at Christmas--we can't leave for the holidays without having a guarantee that children and families and individuals across our country will be able to have the health insurance and the medical care they have been receiving.  The best Christmas present--the best New Year's present we could give families--is to guarantee that moms and dads can take their kids to the doctor, if we have the Children's Health Insurance Program, and that people young and old across the country who use community health centers will still know they can count on them.  Let me close by just sharing a story from John, who is one of the more than 12,700 veterans served by Michigan's community health centers.  John had always been healthy. He didn't have health insurance. In fact, the last time he had seen a doctor was when he was still in the service back in 1975.  Last summer, he started having symptoms. He tried to ignore them, but his wife knew something was wrong. They tried to get help but faced long waits for him to be seen. That is when they contacted the Traverse Health  The clinic was able to get John in right away, and his wife's fears were confirmed. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  The team at Traverse Health Clinic helped get John admitted to the hospital, coordinated services with the cardiologist, and got him signed up for health coverage. That is what community health centers do--connect people with the services they need to be treated or provide preventive care so that they can stay healthy.  In John's case, he says it changed his life. John said this:       There are a lot of people like me who were doing fine and      now they're not. There are a lot of people like me who need a      place like Traverse Health I consider myself      extremely fortunate. Now I have a doctor. I'm so thankful.  On behalf of the 25 million people who use community health centers and the 9 million children covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program, it is time that we act. They have been waiting for 73 days. We could do this in a few hours, in a day, on the Senate floor. I urge us to get this done.  Thank you.

189,topic-id,1124,"Mr.President, I rise today to commend this body. My colleagues, every single Senator, voted in unanimous consent to move forward on the National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law just this week by President In particular, I want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John McCain, who did so much to shepherd this important piece of legislation through this body and to the President's desk. I thank Senator McCain for all his service and sacrifice to America for decades.  The NDAA, as we all know, is an important, critical piece of legislation, boosting our national security, rebuilding our military readiness, and protecting the men and women in uniform who serve our It has been a piece of legislation that for 56 consecutive years on a bipartisan basis has moved through the Senate and the House to be signed by the Many times you hear there is not a lot of bipartisanship that is going on in On issues like this, there is. This bill, which authorizes almost $700 billion for our troops who need it, passed the Senate unanimously.  Not all the members of the military had their bill, which authorized spending and funding for what they are doing, moved through the Unfortunately, our men and women in the U.Coast Guard--our Nation's fifth branch of service--have been, once again, left behind. The NDAA covers the Army, Air Force, Navy, and  The Coast Guard Authorization Act focuses on the heroic men and women in the Coast This year, we worked hard on that bill, 1129, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017. I sponsored this bill with Chairman John Thune, the chairman of the Commerce Committee; Ranking Member Bill Nelson; and Senator Lisa This bipartisan bill--and it is very bipartisan--will give the Coast Guard the resources it needs to protect our waterways and coastlines, block illegal traffickers and smugglers of drugs, and more efficiently procure future Coast Guard cutters, which our country, and my State, desperately need. It is a very, very important bill.  In constructing this legislation, we worked in a bipartisan manner for months. However, despite broad support from both Republicans and Democrats, it appears the Coast Guard Authorization Act--a critical bill for homeland security, for the safety of our mariners and fishermen, and for showing support to the thousands of men and women who serve in the Coast Guard--has become stuck.  As chairman of the committee responsible for the U.Coast Guard, I must speak up for the men and women of this important service and the critical services they provide. This bill should have been moving months ago. Not only does this bill contain critical needs and authorizations and funding authorizations for the Coast Guard, it also contains provisions of vital importance to our maritime and fishing communities. Included in this legislation is important language to permanently fix an issue that has been around for years--one that pertains to incidental discharges for those in our fishing fleets. It is also known as the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or VIDA, as part of the Coast Guard bill.  Currently, vessel owners and operators are forced to comply with a patchwork of burdensome Federal and State regulations for vessel ballast water and incidental discharges. This creates inefficiency, adds costs, and inhibits economic prosperity for my State and for the country, while not providing a uniform standard to protect the environment, which is also critical. This fix that is in the Coast Guard bill would provide the maritime industry, the fishing industry, with a consistent, uniform regulatory structure, restoring cost-effective commerce while also ensuring environmental protection of our Nation's ports, waterways, and fisheries. Notably, for a large number of my constituents, this provision--the VIDA provision in the Coast Guard bill--provides a permanent exemption on incidental vessel discharge for all fishing vessels and small commercial boats.  It is very important because previous legislation required even small fishing vessels to get a discharge permit from the EPA to simply hose down their decks. These fishing vessels and small vessels are facing potential noncompliance if we fail to pass the Coast Guard bill soon. They should not be penalized for the refusal of some of my colleagues--very few of my colleagues--who are opponents of this important fix to allow for what we think is a bipartisan, negotiated solution to move forward.  The fix in this bill on VIDA is supported by all segments of the maritime industry, with U.and international vessel owners and operators, fishing vessels--both large and small--passenger vessels, charter boat operators, labor unions, the Navy League of the United States, marine terminals, and port authorities throughout the country, just to name a few, all in support.  There is broad bipartisan support and agreement by Democrats and Republicans that this bill--with the VIDA provision in the Coast Guard Authorization Act--should move forward. I was going to come here this evening and ask unanimous consent that we pass the bill now. Out of respect for some of my colleagues who are still working in good faith on this issue, I have decided to refrain from that, but we are losing patience.  There have been numerous suggested compromises to help get a few Senators to yes on this. We have accepted almost every single one of them. We are negotiating in good faith. We even held a big meeting this afternoon with many staff on another suggestion, which the EPA said was an unworkable idea.  I believe we are now down to one single issue on this important piece of legislation. Out of respect for my colleagues--one of whom I just got off the phone with, the Senator from Michigan, whom I have a very close working relationship on the committee that oversees the Coast Guard because he is my ranking member--we are going to try to work through the weekend and resolve this. I hope that the remaining Senators act in good faith. What we don't want to see, as we accept every single compromise put forward, is the goalpost continuously being moved.  The deadline is fast approaching for our fishermen and maritime fleet. We must get this done. The deadline has long past to show that we respect, care for, and want to do all we can to support the men and women in the Coast Guard the way we support the other military services, as we saw this week when President Trump passed a very bipartisan  I call on all of my colleagues to work through the weekend so that we can get to yes on this very important bill--the Coast Guard bill--and so that we can support them the way we are supporting the other men and women in our military.

We call them our Alaskan of the  Alaska is beautiful, it is big, and it is special. Right now, much of the State is gearing up for the skiing season. Snow is out, and there is nothing more beautiful and invigorating than taking to the slopes of It is also a great time to see the Northern Lights dancing in the sky. So I urge everybody to come out to Winter or summer, it will be the trip of a lifetime.  Of course, it is much more than snow and beautiful dancing lights; our people are what make us so special--rugged, independent, generous, and giving to their families, their communities, our State, and our country.  Alaska is a patriotic State--I would argue, the most patriotic State in our great For one, we have the most veterans per capita of any State in We have the very best military forces, and we have a lot of them. Let me name just a few.  We have the Army's 1st Stryker Brigade, based at Fort Chike Springer, one of my staffers helping me out here, served there in the 1st Stryker Brigade's Aviation Task We have the Northern Warfare Training Center; the 59th Signal Battalion; the 17th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion; the Air Force's Third Wing, 11th Air Force; the 176th Wing; the 673rd Air Base Wing; the Air Force reservists of the 477th Fighter Group; the 354th at Eielson; and the 213th Space Warning Squadron at Clear Air Force You get the picture--some of the best military forces. The 49th Missile Defense Battalion, the cornerstone of America's missile defense, protecting the entire Nation, is right there at Fort These are the thousands of men and women in the Reserves and on Active Duty who are stationed in our great We are proud of them, and we owe them and their families a huge debt of gratitude for their service, especially now that we are approaching the holiday season.  Today, I want to particularly recognize the men and women who make up the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division--the only airborne brigade combat team in the Pacific theater and in the As my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee know, they are referred to in Alaska and throughout the Army as the 4-25. This unit, over 3,000 men and women strong, is our Alaskans of the  I want to talk a little bit about the 4-25. It has a very strong lineage and heritage. Although it was created relatively recently--in 2004--and was the first new U.airborne unit created since the end of World War II, its heritage springs from the 25th Infantry Division, which was first activated in 1941 and played a seminal role in World War II and all of our country's conflicts since.  Just like the 25th Infantry Division, the 4-25 has played a major role in our country's conflicts since its inception. Members of the 4-25 have deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and just last September, a couple months ago, they were again deployed to Afghanistan to train and advise Afghan security forces.  As part of a larger drawdown of our military and the Army--a misguided drawdown by the previous administration, announced in 2015--the 4-25 was part of 40,000 Active-Duty Army soldiers to be cut, just gotten rid of. This would have been an enormous strategic mistake for the Army and for America's national security, especially as it related to the 4-25, the only mountain, cold weather, airborne BCT in the entire Arctic and Asia They are also a critical reserve force for any contingency on the Korean Peninsula given how close we in Alaska are to  So what happened? Alaskans circled the wagons. Rallies with hundreds, if not thousands, of my fellow Alaskans came out in our great State, urging the Department of Defense and the U.Army: Don't make this mistake. Don't cut this unit. Keep it intact.  Here in Washington, we did our work. I had a heart-to-heart with a number of senior Army and DOD officials with one simple goal in mind: to get them to personally visit this unit, to come see them train, to see how capable they were, and to understand their strategic value to America's national security. And that happened. Many senior Army officials--the Army Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the Army--went to Alaska, went to JRTC, and watched the 4-25 in action.  I remember standing on the second floor of a building in a mock Middle Eastern town watching members of the 4-25 jump into an LZ at JRTC in the middle of the night for a nighttime airfield seizure operation. There is something awe-inspiring about watching 1,000 airborne paratroopers silently fall out of the night sky to seize terrain--something that probably sends chills up the spine of our Nation's enemies.  Fast-forward to today. Of the 40,000 soldiers slated to be cut from the U.Army, only one unit was spared--one--and it was the 4-25. Why did this happen? It happened because they made it happen. This great unit saved themselves. When the Army's top brass went to Alaska, went to Fort Polk and watched them train at JRTC, they saw what a great unit this was and realized they were making a big mistake. When General Milley, Chief of Staff of the Army, made the final decision to reverse the previous decision of the Army and retain the 4-25, he said it was ``one of the most trained and ready units in the entire United States Army.'' That was the Chief of Staff of the  The 4-25 didn't rest. They are deployed, back in Unfortunately, while deployed, just a few days ago, on December 11, Alaska lost a son and the 4-25 lost one of its own as part[[Page S8038]]of this mission. It is heartbreaking for the families and for the unit. These brave young men and women are willing to sacrifice and have already sacrificed, and our prayers are with them during these holidays.  They are our Alaskans of the  I plan on visiting them overseas during the holidays. My wife Julie will also be attending an event this weekend in Anchorage for the families of those who are deployed, showing our support and our respect for the men and women in this unit and their families, because, as many know, when a family is deployed, it is not just the young man and woman in the unit who sacrifice, it is the entire family.  To the families, we say thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for your service and sacrifice. To the men and women who make up the 4-25, we also say thank you for all you are doing for us--for serving us, for keeping us safe, for protecting this country, when Americans are enjoying the holidays.  I look forward to seeing you in theater. Please be assured that all Members of this body--Senators, Democrats, Republicans--know your record of service and wish all of you Godspeed this holiday season.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.4323, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers  I led this bill with the gentleman from Florida because finding ways to improve higher education for veterans is essential to our economy and critical to keeping our promise to those who serve.  This legislation advances the great work being done by the National Science Foundation by requiring NSF to develop a plan to help more veterans enter science, technology, engineering, and math fields.  In addition, it requires NSF to report available data on veterans participating in STEM fields.  NSF will also be required to recruit veterans for existing NSF programs, including the Noyse Teacher Scholarship program, and for cybersecurity-specific education and training programs.  Finally, this bill creates an interagency committee to help veterans and their spouses transition to STEM careers, including reporting on their progress.  All of us understand the challenges veterans face when trying to further their education, but we have also seen what happens when former servicemembers are empowered to success as civilians. After World War II, soldiers returned home to a GI Bill that sparked an era of innovation and economic growth.  By helping veterans enter STEM education and research programs, this bill will help build a workforce that is prepared to succeed in the modern economy.

By offering these real changes, smaller institutions--like the GOP Federal Credit Union, for example, in my district--can once again focus their full attention on relationship lending in the community without worry of government overregulation.  Once again, the current law mandates that all institutions follow escrow requirements, which raises the cost of credit for those borrowers who can least afford it, while harming small local institutions.  Mr.Speaker, I specifically thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Sherman) for working with me on this bill, and I appreciate his support throughout the process.

292,topic-id,1973,"Mr.President, for more than two decades, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents and Republican and Democratic Congresses, the United States pursued a bipartisan light-touch approach to internet regulation. The internet as we know it today flourished under this light-touch approach, much to the benefit of American consumers and the domestic economy. It also made America the world leader in internet technology and positioned us to continue that leadership in the years to come.  In 2002, broadband internet was classified by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, our Nation's communications regulator, as an information service under title I of the Communications This classification exempted the internet from burdensome regulations contained in title II of the Communications Act, which were designed in the Depression era for the old telephone monopolies.  Under the Obama administration, we saw repeated attempts to bring the internet under greater government control. Finally, in 2015, at the explicit direction of President Obama, the FCC did as it was told and reclassified broadband internet access service as a title II service, subjecting broadband internet to onerous common carrier rules and opening the door to further regulation, including price regulation. Not surprisingly, with heavier regulation came a decline in broadband investment. Indeed, we have seen private investment in broadband infrastructure decline over the past 2 years. This decline should not be mistaken as a sign that broadband infrastructure is not needed. In fact, the opposite is true, as there are still 34 million Americans who lack access to broadband services at home.  In States like my home State of South Dakota, encouraging broadband deployment continues to be critical to ensuring that rural areas have the same economic opportunity as their urban counterparts. The Federal Government should not be putting up barriers to broadband deployment; it should be removing them. Congress and the FCC need to ensure regulatory framework is in place that protects consumers but that doesn't stand in the way of investment and innovation.  Prior to the FCC's 2015 actions to bring broadband under title II, and for more than a decade under the light-touch regulatory framework of title I, we saw unprecedented growth that revolutionized our daily lives and allowed us to stay better connected with our loved ones. The internet created new jobs and expanded opportunities for education and commerce. It became the greatest engine of innovation for our times.  Despite the fearmongering and doomsday rhetoric that continues to plague this debate, when the FCC moves forward and restores the internet to its pre-2015 regulatory status, the internet will continue to thrive and serve as an engine for future economic growth.  I commend Chairman Pai at the FCC and the entire Commission for all the hard work over the last year that has gotten us to this point. I also commend Chairman Pai for his commitment to transparency throughout this process. For the first time in the history of the Commission, under Chairman Pai's leadership, the public was able to view the Restoring Internet Freedom item 3 weeks prior to the FCC's vote. That is true of all documents to be considered by the Commission--a major departure from the previous administration's actions, which were often not made public until the very last minute. As a result of Chairman Pai's commitment to transparency, the public has the benefit of not only viewing the item but also participating in the process.  Despite attempts by those more interested in politicizing the issue and distracting from this debate, this item resulted in the most well informed and most exhaustive record of comments ever submitted to the The FCC is now well positioned to move forward to ensure that the internet is open and free. Regrettably, however, debate doesn't end there. The outcry from opponents of the FCC's proposal is that the internet will fall apart without adequate consumer protections.  There is obviously immense passion that follows the issue of net neutrality. Americans care deeply about preserving a free and open internet, as do I and so many of my colleagues in the U.Senate on both sides of the aisle.  As I have stated repeatedly and I will say again today, congressional action is the only way to solve the endless back-and-forth on net neutrality rules that we have seen over the past several years. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and those who claim to support net neutrality rules want to enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of the law, I call on them today to join me in discussing legislation that would do just that. While we are not going to agree on everything, I believe there is much room for compromise.  Many of us in Congress already agree on many of the principles of net neutrality. True supporters of an open internet should be demanding such legislative protections today, not posturing while waiting for years during protracted legal proceedings or waiting for the political winds to shift.  If Republicans and Democrats have the political support to work together on such a compromise, we can enact a regulatory framework that will stand the test of time. I have stood willing to work with any and all supporters of net neutrality protections for many years now, and I continue to stand ready today.  It is time for Congress to settle this debate, and I welcome discussion on ways to ensure a free and open internet for decades to come.                            Tax Reform Bill  Mr.President, it has been a good week in the U.We are getting closer and closer to the finish line[[Page S7952]]on tax reform. That means we are getting closer and closer to real relief for the American people. Our legislation is going to cut tax bills for American families, it is going to increase their wages, and it is going to give them access to new jobs and opportunities.  The tax bill the Senate passed on December 2 would cut income tax rates for American families starting next month. It would double the standard deduction. It would double the child tax credit. That would mean a substantially lower tax bill for American families next year. Under our bill, a family of four making $73,000 a year would see a $2,200 tax cut.  But our bill doesn't just provide immediate relief for families. Our bill also sets families up for economic health for the long-term by giving them access to higher wages, new jobs, and better opportunities.  How does it do this? By improving the playing field for American businesses. In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive.  Thriving businesses create jobs and provide opportunities; they increase wages and invest in their workers. But our current Tax Code has not been helping businesses thrive. For years now, our tax laws have left businesses of all sizes struggling under the burden of high tax rates and an outdated tax system that has left American businesses at a disadvantage in the global economy. Small businesses employ nearly half of American workers and create a majority of new jobs in this country, but right now small businesses face high tax rates that can make it difficult for these businesses to even survive, much less thrive and expand their operations.  Our bill fixes this. To start with, our bill implements a new deduction for passthrough businesses, such as partnerships, LLCs, and S corporations. This deduction would allow them to keep more of their money, which would allow them to reinvest in their operations to increase wages and to hire new workers.  Our bill also reforms current provisions in the Tax Code that frequently leave small businesses with little cash on hand. Under our legislation, small businesses would be able to recover the capital they have invested in inventory and machinery much more quickly and, in certain cases, immediately. This, in turn, would free up capital small businesses could use to expand and create jobs.  Our legislation also includes provisions that I helped develop that would simplify accounting rules for small businesses, which would also help reduce their tax burden, leaving more of their earnings to reinvest in their businesses and in their workers.  In addition to providing relief to small businesses, our bill will boost American wages by lowering our massive corporate tax rate. Our Nation's corporate tax rate is currently the highest in the industrialized world, which puts U.businesses at a major disadvantage next to their international competitors. Reducing the corporate tax rate will enable U.businesses to compete on a more level playing field, freeing up money that U.businesses can use to create jobs and to increase wages.  The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent would increase wages for U.households by $4,000. That is money that families could use to save for retirement, help pay for a child's education, replace an aging vehicle, or invest in their home.  Our bill would also boost wages and increase opportunities for Americans by ending the outdated tax framework that is driving American companies to keep jobs and profits overseas. Our Nation currently operates under a so-called worldwide tax system. That means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home as well as on part of the profits they make abroad, once they bring that money back to the United The problem with this is that American companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. When they bring that money home, they can end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It is no surprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, new jobs, and increased wages.  Our bill replaces our outdated worldwide tax system with a territorial tax system. Under our legislation, American companies would no longer face the double taxation that has encouraged them to send their investments and their operations overseas. Instead, U.companies would have a strong incentive to invest their profits at home in American jobs and American workers.  All in all, the Tax Foundation estimates that in addition to increasing wages, our bill would create nearly 1 million new jobs for American workers and boost the size of the economy by 3.7 percent.  This week, Members of the House and the Senate--myself included--are working on the final draft of comprehensive tax reform legislation. We hope to send a final bill to the President next week. I am thankful to have been able to be part of this tax-writing effort.  The bill we are finalizing, which is the product of years of work by Members of both parties, represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to profoundly change the American people's lives for the better. Our tax bill will provide real, immediate, direct relief to Americans and do it now, and it will give Americans access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities they need for a secure and prosperous future. After years of economic stagnation, the bill we are drafting will usher in a new era of economic dynamism in this country, and it will send a message to the world that America is serious about competing and winning in the 21st century.  I am grateful to my colleagues on the House and Senate tax-writing committees for all the work they have done to put together this legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the conference committee to finish our final draft and to get this bill across the finish line for the American people.  Mr.President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

334,topic-id,764,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  My motion to recommit is just a commonsense measure that I believe everybody in this House can support because it would prevent the bad actors from being able to use the exemptions in the underlying bill to dodge the consumer protections that are found in both the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures  My motion says if a lender has committed or engaged in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a financial product or service, or if they have been convicted of fraud under Federal or State law in connection with a residential mortgage loan, they cannot avail themselves of the bill's decreased requirements.  As you know, Mr.Speaker, I represent the heart of the Las Vegas valley. More than 43 million visitors come to my district every year from all around the world to enjoy our first class resorts, hotels, entertainment, and the natural beauty around us. It is also, though, home to over 2 million people.  Less than a decade ago, southern Nevada, unfortunately, had the additional distinction of being at the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis that was caused by the Great At its peak, nearly 70 percent of all homes in the Las Vegas valley were under water, and the foreclosure rate was five times the national average. For 62 straight months, Nevada led the Nation in foreclosures and delinquent mortgages. This is the number--just think about this--219,000 foreclosures occurred during that period.  Newspapers from coast to coast read like obituaries as home after home was boarded up, homelessness skyrocketed, and major developments along the Las Vegas strip that were under construction went belly-up, leaving high-rise rusting skeletons in the middle of the desert. We lost 80,000 construction jobs during that period.  We were one of the first States to be hit so hard by the recession and one of the last States to recover. But housing prices are coming back and new construction is taking place.  Unfortunately, it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to turn back the clock and go back to the abusive practices, including predatory lending, that contributed to the Great  Supporters of this legislation--you have heard them--say it is needed to provide relief for smaller sized institutions and smaller sized mortgage servicers. But that is really the red herring here. The CFPB has already, as you heard too, provided a targeted exemption to cover those folks.  This bill is really about protecting the large servicers that failed to provide necessary loan documentation and to communicate openly with their customers, in turn contributing to millions of unnecessary disclosures and settlements for abusive business practices during the financial crisis.  Nevada, in fact, had to bring lawsuits against financial institutions like Countrywide and Bank of America that engaged in this predatory lending.  My motion to recommit would ensure that such lending practices and loan servicing activities cannot resurface at the expense of consumers.  This is especially important also in light of the fact that at the same time we are eroding consumer protections put in place after the financial crisis, my Republican colleagues are also simultaneously taking away affordable housing from my constituents. The ``Job Cuts and Tax Act'' passed by this House eliminates tax-exempt private activity bonds, a move that will stifle investments in affordable housing.  The Nevada Housing Division, for example, has already suspended its mortgage credit certificate program which provides an average of $2,000 a year in Federal income tax savings to first-time home buyers and veterans because of the threat of this provision.  Furthermore, multifamily housing bonds make affordable housing possible for seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and low-income families. Without the tax exemption on these bonds, Nevada can lose up to 7,000 rental homes.  So, Mr.Speaker, I ask you: How can this body pass a bill that eliminates affordable rental homes; makes ownership more expensive for first-time home buyers; and opens the door, again, to predatory lending practices that target low-income borrowers and put them at risk of foreclosure?  This mix of anticonsumer and antiaffordable housing policies does not bode well for a country that suffered a housing crisis just a decade ago, so I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion to recommit.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgH9799-4.txt,1940,ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION,2017.0,12.0,December

645,topic-id,2856,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, for yielding me time and for bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification  Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr.Clay, for his leadership on this bill. It has been a pleasure to work across the aisle on this commonsense measure with someone for whom I have such great respect.  This bill makes a simple technical correction to Federal law. Under the legislation, financial institutions are no longer required to mail duplicative and confusing privacy notifications every year when no changes have been made to the policy. Privacy information must be made available on the company website, and financial institutions must send paper copies to consumers upon request.  Under this legislation, companies are required to provide a toll-free number so customers can request the policy at any time.  Additionally, consumers will be reminded of their right to opt out of information-sharing when they receive their bills. If you are like me, you throw away these documents. They are confusing, dense, and full of fine-print legalese. I can never tell if anything has changed, and I am a lawyer.  This legislation will ensure that consumers are alerted of changes and will no longer be inundated with junk mail.  This measure will also help companies provide better service to their customers. Some companies spend over $2 million annually on these mailings--money that could be put to better use making more car loans or perhaps even lowering the cost of their product.  During a recent hearing on this bill, a community banker told us about a similar provision that had passed for banks last year. He spoke about how positive it had been for his community and his customers. He took the money he would have spent on postage and paper and gave it back to the community in the form of more loans. This, in turn, helped people start new businesses, create more jobs, and even resulted in a few mortgages being made to purchase new homes.  I believe every Member should support getting rid of outdated, unnecessary regulations. This bill will allow those who lend money when we buy a new car to realize the same savings and efficiencies as banks. Not only will this legislation reduce unnecessary costs, it will improve transparency and accountability, and ensure individuals better understand when a company has actually changed its privacy policy.  A few minutes ago, the ranking member spoke in opposition to this bill. I am not sure what bill she read, but it was not H.2396. The bill in no way puts consumers' privacy information at risk. It in no way denies consumers important privacy protections. It in no way has anything to do with It has nothing to do with Wells It has nothing to do with servicemembers having their cars improperly repossessed. It has nothing to do with consumer profiling. It has nothing to do with fraud. And--she didn't bring it up--it has nothing to do with the President's tax returns.  This bill should have been on the suspension calendar. There are only two groups that can oppose this bill: the United States Postal Service, because it is going to mean less business for them; and, as the chairman mentioned, paper mills.  The ranking member did, in fact, offer an amendment. The amendment was so convoluted that if I was a bank, a financial institution, or a car lender, I would prefer to do the mailings, because the amendment, at the end of the day, was really just a haven for class action lawyers to file frivolous lawsuits when someone didn't put something on their website exactly as outlined in the amendment.

Annual privacy notices without policy changes are      redundant, unnecessary, and confusing. They contain several      pages of small-print legalese, which have little value for      consumers. In fact, they are largely discarded--unread--     immediately upon receipt. However, producing and mailing      these notices costs millions of dollars.       In the fall of 2014, the CFPB finalized a rule allowing FIs      to post their annual privacy notices online instead of      delivering them individually if they meet a series of      conditions, including not sharing the consumers' nonpublic      personal information with unaffiliated third parties. In      December 2015, Congress went further by enacting an outright      exemption from the mailing requirement for FIs that: (1) do      not share non-public personal information about consumers to      unaffiliated third parties, and (2) have not changed its      disclosure policies and practices since the most recent      disclosure was sent to consumers.       Unfortunately, certain FIs cannot take advantage of the      exemption. We ask Congress to pass the Privacy Notification      Technical Clarification Act to level the playing field for      all If a financial institution's privacy policy has not      materially changed, the institution should be permitted to      satisfy the intent of GLBA by delivering its privacy notice      through an electronic medium, or by mail upon request.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Himpler,     Executive Vice                                  ____                                 National Bankers Association,                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.     William Lacy Clay,     Washington,     David Trott,     Washington,       Dear Representatives Clay and Trott: On behalf of the      National Bankers Association (NBA), I write to express our      member banks' support for H.2396, the Privacy Notification      Technical Corrections The NBA is the nation's leading      trade organization for the country's minority and women-owned      depository institutions. We write in support of H.2396      because our member banks believe updating the delivery of      privacy notices should be modernize and reflective of the      technological choices available to institutions and      customers. As you are aware, the CFPB and Congress have made      changes to the privacy notification process in 2014 and 2015.      These changes excluded specific financial institutions and we      believe a simple method for alternative delivery for these      companies is warranted.       Producing and mailing privacy notices costs millions of      dollars. Eliminating the requirement would reduce the cost of      delivering financial services, save paper and discontinue      this annual nuisance. At the same time, it would also make      the mailings more significant to the consumer because they      would only come after a change in policy. The primary      function of the annual notice is to remind consumers of their      right to opt out of information-sharing for marketing      purposes, but it is not obvious that mailing a paper      disclosure is the most effective or reliable medium for      accomplishing this objective.       H.2396 is a sensible and balanced approach that enjoys      broad bipartisan support, that we believe addresses concerns      shared by our bankers regarding the need for modernization in      the delivery of privacy notifications. We commend you for      your leadership on this important issue, and we would urge      your colleagues to support this legislation.           Respectfully,                                                 Michael Grant,     President, National Bankers                                  ____       H.2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification      Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by David Trott (MI)      and Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee      Ranking Member William Lacy Clay (MO) and the substitute      language, would simplify the notice requirements for      financial institutions that have not changed their privacy      policies. In addition to the relief provided by the FAST Act      for financial institutions that only share information within      the statutory exceptions, it would create a simple disclosure      mechanism using the Internet for financial institutions that      have not changed their privacy practices. The ABA supports      H.2396.       H.2706, the Financial Institution Customer Protection      This legislation, as introduced by House Financial      Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee Chairman Blaine      Luetkemeyer would dictate that federal banking agencies could      not request nor order a financial institution to terminate a      banking relationship unless the regulator has material      reason. The legislation further states that account      termination requests or orders would be required to be made      in writing and rely on information other than reputational      risk. We thank Chairman Luetkemeyer for his attention to this      issue as he well knows that banks are in the business of      providing financial services for law-abiding customers, and      they share a common goal with law enforcement of maintaining      the integrity of the payments system. If there is reasonable      concern regarding a customer, it works best when banks work      together with our regulatory agencies and law enforcement.      This legislation supports that concept. The ABA supports H.     2706.       H.2954, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment      This legislation, as introduced by Tom Emmer (MN), would      provide community banks with relief from compliance burdens      that are ill-suited and unnecessary for community banks.       Specifically, the bill exempts small banks and credit      unions from new reporting requirements of the Home Mortgage      Disclosure Act (HMDA) if they are lenders that have      originated 1,000 or fewer closed-end mortgages in each of the      two preceding calendar years or are lenders that have      originated 2,000 or fewer open-end lines of credit (such as a      typical home equity loan) in each of the two preceding      calendar years. Additionally, the bill repeals the HMDA      amendments included in the Dodd-Frank Act and withdraws the      CFPB's rule to impose the new and modified HMDA data points      scheduled to take effect in January of next year.       The pending HMDA changes were imposed after the financial      crisis. Although well-intentioned, the new reporting      requirements were overly broad in their coverage and have the      potential to add significant cost and regulatory burden, as      well as privacy concerns for customers, to small institutions      which have an excellent track record of fairly and honestly      serving their customers' needs.       So great is the cost of compliance with these new      regulations that many smaller banks may be forced to      reconsider their ability to continue to make mortgage and      other covered loans. H.2954 provides needed relief to keep      more lending options available in the markets that these      banks serve. The ABA supports H.2954.                                  ____ H.3299, the ``Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017''       The decision by the Second Circuit Court in the Madden v.      Midland Funding, LLC case undermined a long-standing legal      principle, the ``valid-when-made'' doctrine, which      establishes that if a loan is valid when it is made with      respect to its interest rate then it cannot become invalid or      unenforceable when assigned to another party. CBA strongly      supports H.3329 that solidifies the ``valid-when-made''      doctrine, which has been a cornerstone of U.banking law      for over 100 years and prevent uncertainty for financial      institutions.   H.2706, the ``Financial Institution Customer Protection Act of                                  2017''       CBA strongly supports H.2706, the ``Financial      Institution Customer Protection Act,'' that would require      federal banking regulatory agencies to establish requirements      for the termination of bank accounts and prohibit federal      banking regulators from formally or informally suggesting,      requesting, or ordering a depository institution to terminate      a customer account except in circumstances affecting the      security of our country or specific illegal activity.  H.2396, the ``Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act''       CBA supports H.2396, the Privacy Notification Technical      Correction Act, to reduce unnecessary paperwork by      streamlining the reporting of bank privacy policies.      Specifically, H.2396 would relieve a bank of its annual      privacy policy notice requirement if it has not changed its      policies and practices, makes its current policy publically      available, notifies customers of the availability of the      notice on periodic billing statements or electronically, and      posts all notices if it maintains more than one policy.                               Conclusion       CBA stands ready to work with Congress to ensure a sound      regulatory framework for financial institutions and promote      competition in the financial marketplace. On behalf of the      members of CBA, we appreciate the opportunity to submit this      letter in support of a number of legislative proposals that      would ease regulatory burdens and provide greater access to      capital for consumers.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                  Minority Automobile Dealers,                                     Largo, MD, December 12, 2017.

Our primary objective is to pursue the      meaningful presence and participation of minority businesses      and diverse employees across all aspects of the automotive      economic sector, including:       Increasing the number of minority-owned dealerships in      communities across       Advocating workplace and supplier diversity in the      automotive manufacturing environment.       Supporting minority engagement in the automotive retail      sales and service sectors.       We write in support of H.2396 because it is a sensible      and balanced approach that enjoys broad bipartisan support,      which we believe addresses concerns related to modernizing      the delivery of privacy notifications shared by the indirect      auto financing companies that work with our dealers as well      as[[Page H9909]]     those dealers that also provide in-house financing of their      own directly to consumers.       As you all know, the CFPB and Congress have made changes to      the privacy notification process in 2014 and 2015. These      changes excluded specific financial institutions and we      believe a simple method for alternative delivery for these      companies is warranted. Eliminating this requirement would      reduce the cost of delivering financial services, save paper,      and discontinue this annual nuisance. At the same time, it      would also make the mailings more significant to the consumer      because they would only come after a change in policy.

NAMAD appreciates the commonsense solution proposed in H.     2396 as our members believe the delivery of privacy notices      should be modernized and reflective of the current suite of      technological choices available to institutions and      customers. We commend you for your leadership on this      important issue, and we would urge your colleagues to support      this legislation.           Sincerely,                                                     Damon Lester,                                      ____                                                December 13, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned vehicle financial      institutions (FIs), consisting of captive finance companies      directly affiliated with a manufacturer and who engage in      dealer facilitated financing or indirect auto financing, are      pleased to express our support for H.2396, the Privacy      Notification Technical Clarification We thank      Representatives David Trott (R-MI) and William Lacy Clay,      (D-MO) for introducing commonsense legislation to amend the      Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) by updating the exception for      certain annual notices provided by vehicle FIs to allow for      an electronic delivery mechanism. We urge Members of Congress      to support this important bipartisan legislation.       The GLBA requires FIs to issue privacy notices to consumers      if the FIs share consumers' non-public personal information      with affiliates or unaffiliated third parties. These      disclosures are required to be sent annually by mail, even if      no changes to the policy have occurred. Unfortunately, annual      privacy notices without policy changes are redundant,      unnecessary, and confusing to our consumers. They contain      several pages of small-print legalese, which have little      value for consumers. In fact, they are largely discarded--     unread--immediately upon receipt. However, producing and      mailing these notices is financially costly and time      consuming.       For background, in December 2015, Congress provided for an      outright exemption from the mailing requirement for FIs that:      (1) do not share non-public personal information about      consumers to unaffiliated third parties, and (2) have not      changed disclosure policies and practices since the most      recent disclosure was sent to consumers. Unfortunately,      vehicle FIs remain unable to even utilize an electronic      delivery mechanism for these notices.       We ask members of the House of Representatives to pass H.     2396 to help level the playing field. Specifically, if a      vehicle FI's privacy policy has not materially changed, the      company should be permitted to satisfy the intent of GLBA by      delivering its privacy notice through an electronic medium,      or by mail upon request. The legislation also includes a      requirement that a website address or toll-free number would      be included in regular communications to consumers, such as      monthly statements, as well as a description of where to      locate procedures for the consumer to opt-out at any time.      This would ensure that our consumers have ready access to      privacy policies 365 days a year, including a paper notice if      they choose to receive it.       We respectfully request your support in favor of H.2396.      Thank you for your consideration.

654,topic-id,549,"Mr.Speaker, we are having an argument here about a bill that has strong bipartisan support. When you boil it all down, the argument is pretty simple, and the question for us to consider this morning, and I would submit we have more important things to work on than that question, but that is what we are debating this morning, so let's consider it.  The question we are arguing about is: Do consumers, when they get their mail and they find an envelope filled with 30 pages of small-print legalese, boilerplate language, do they open up that envelope and pour themselves a cup of coffee and settle in--we have 9 inches of snow today back in Michigan, so they settle in next to a fire and spend the next 2 hours reading that privacy notice? That is the question.  The ranking member has been quite critical of the speeches that have been given this morning, submitting that people do read these notices, and who are we to judge whether people read these notices.  We are not making judgment, we are just submitting, on a commonsense basis, an argument that people don't read these notices; people throw these notices away. And that logic and common sense would dictate that if the privacy notice changes, and a new notice arrives, and the consumer realizes, gosh, I got a new privacy notice because the policy changed; I don't get it when the policy doesn't change; I'd better read this. If they are ever going to read it, that is the time they are going to read it.  But if the ranking member is correct in her analysis, and that millions of consumers are waiting by the mailbox each and every day so that they can study, dissect, compare, and contrast these privacy notices, then she is correct. This bill would add an extra step because, instead of going to the mailbox, they would have to click on the website or perhaps call a toll-free number and have the document mailed to them. So if that burden is more important, because people are reading these notices, then her arguments are compelling.  Now, let's examine all those groups that she spent so much time telling us about this morning, all those proconsumer watchdog groups. All those groups are interested in one thing. They are interested in making sure the laws are as complicated and convoluted as possible because all those groups, including the ranking member, believe, incorrectly, all business is bad; all banks are bad; we have to make it as convoluted and as complicated as possible so that class action lawyers can find a reason to file frivolous lawsuits to sue them, because that is what consumers need.  That is illogical because when these class action lawsuits and all these convoluted regulations get placed on the books and the banks have to hire hundreds of lawyers to deal with compliance, who do you think pays for that? The consumer pays for it.  So this bill saves a little money, saves a few trees. Maybe we will have a few more forests for our grandchildren. It is a simple bill, and I feel bad for some of the Democrats, the 20 in our committee----  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

884,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding and for his hard work on this rule.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule today, which allows for consideration of H.2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification  I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Hensarling for guiding this bill through committee, and Chairman Sessions for his work on bringing this rule to the floor. I also want to thank Mr.Clay for his very helpful amendment.  One of the reasons I came to Congress was to reduce the regulatory burden in our country so that businesses could have the freedom to grow, thrive, and create jobs for hardworking This bill is about modernizing one of those outdated regulations that has been a burden to businesses and consumers alike, the privacy notification rules.  Now, a couple of minutes ago, my friend from Colorado gave a very nice speech about DACA, about tax reform, about the public opinion of this institution; but the speech had nothing to do with consideration of this rule today. When he finally got around to talking about the rule, he said we should not allow the rule to move forward because the underlying bill, H.2396, in light of the Equifax scandal, we should not be eliminating privacy notices and allow banks to circumvent those rules because it is going to hurt consumers.  None of this is correct. This bill is a very simple bill. It deals with auto finance companies and it relieves them from the burden of having to send out privacy notices to consumers year after year when the policy hasn't changed. If the auto finance companies change the policy, they have to send out new privacy notices. If a consumer calls up and says, ``I know the policy hasn't change, but I would like to see the rule,'' they can go on the website or they can ask that the policy be mailed to them. This bill in no way harms consumers.  Now, just last year, we passed the bipartisan bill that allowed banks to stop sending privacy notices to consumers if nothing in the policy had changed. This noncontroversial measure passed by voice vote, with Members on both sides of aisle realizing that companies were wasting enormous amounts of paper and money sending out duplicative and unnecessary privacy notices year after year.  The bill achieved its goal. Millions of dollars that would have been spent on paper and postage were instead put back into our local communities. My bill builds on this success and extends the provision to companies lending money to people buying vehicles.  This means that those who extend credit to consumers who buy vehicles from Ford, GM, Harley-Davidson, and other iconic American companies would receive the same benefit as banks, and, more importantly, consumers would no longer be bombarded with a never-ending stream of little print privacy notices and policies that haven't changed.  This is a bipartisan, commonsense measure. I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and allow debate to begin on this legislation.

921,topic-id,640,"Thank you, Mr.President, for the recognition.  Mr.President, the President of the United States terminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, otherwise known as DACA, 3 months ago. He gave Congress 6 months to act. We are no closer today to helping our Dreamers than the day the President so callously canceled the program.  We have almost 800,000 young people whose lives, dreams, and futures hang in the balance. They are scared. Their families are scared. Everything they have worked for is at risk.  Dreamers represent some of our very best and brightest. They are going to school, holding down jobs, volunteering in our communities. They want to be doctors, lawyers, engineers. They want to start businesses.  They came here as children, and they are American through and through. They love our country as much as any of us, and they want to stay and contribute.  We have almost 7,000 Dreamers in my home State of New Carlos is one of them. Carlos was brought to New Mexico from Mexico when he was less than 1 year old. New Mexico is the only home Carlos has ever known.  Because of Carlos's immigration status, his opportunities were limited. He couldn't play sports in school, and he couldn't go on field trips, even though he pledged allegiance to the United States, just like his classmates.  Carlos registered with DACA 2 years ago, and in his words, he was given ``wings.'' He is now a full-time student at New Mexico State University, studying to be a mechanical engineer. He volunteers as a firefighter. He works as a server at a local restaurant, and he began a drive to help Hurricane Harvey victims.  Carlos says: ``We, as Dreamers, have proven ourselves to be worthy of being here in the United States.''  Carlos's story can be told hundreds of thousands of times over. Congress must act, and we must act now. We owe it to these young people. We must give Carlos and all other Dreamers their wings.  Passing the Dream Act is the morally right thing to do, but it is also the economically smart thing to do. Dreamers' contributions to the U.economy are astounding. Their jobs span the spectrum. They work in health, education, nonprofits, wholesale, retail, business, and hold professional jobs. Most of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ Dreamers, and that is why more than 400 CEOs of major U.companies have urged Congress to pass the Dream  If Congress fails to act, it will cost us 700,000 jobs--as many as 30,000 jobs a month--causing chaos for employers, and we could see a $460 billion decrease in economic output over a decade. Social Security and Medicare contributions could drop by $39.3 billion over the same period.  In my State, New Mexico would lose nearly 6,000 DACA workers and take a $385 million hit. We simply cannot afford it.  We have a bipartisan Dream Act before us. Senator Durbin is working with our Republican colleagues, Republican friends, to get us over the finish line. Let's do the right thing by these young people, and let's do it now so Carlos can become an engineer and so hundreds of thousands of Dreamers can stop living in fear and move forward with their lives. It is our moral obligation to do this.  We also must do right by the 11 million immigrants in our Nation who are working, raising families, contributing to our economy, and helping in our communities. Congress must stop kicking the can down the road. We must do our job. We must debate and pass comprehensive immigration reform. Law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our Nation should be given a pathway to citizenship.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislation went through regular order and was reported by the full committee with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.  This bill promotes hydropower by development at existing nonpowered dams by establishing an expedited licensing process that will result in a final decision on an application in 2 years or less. We know hydropower is a clean, renewable, and reliable source of energy that provides low-cost electricity to millions of  As we have learned through hearings at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the current regulatory process places new hydropower projects at existing nonpowered dams at a significant disadvantage. The current process takes way too long and it creates too much uncertainty, burdening consumers with additional unnecessary costs and preventing jobs and economic opportunities.  This bill, H.2872, makes important changes to the process to enable FERC to issue a decision in 2 years or less. The legislation also requires that FERC, as well as the U.Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of the[[Page H9810]]Interior, to develop a list of existing nonpowered Federal dams that have the greatest potential for non-Federal hydropower development.  This is a good bipartisan bill. I thank Bucshon for his hard work on this important issue and for working with our colleagues across the aisle to bring the bill to the floor.

819,topic-id,316,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this bill, H.2880, was introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee member Morgan Griffith in June of this year. The legislation went through regular order, and it was reported by the full committee with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.  The bill promotes closed-loop pumped storage hydropower projects by establishing an expedited licensing process that is going to result in a final decision on an application in 2 years or less.  We know that hydropower is a clean, renewable, and reliable source of energy that provides low-cost electricity to millions of Americans across the country. Closed-loop pumped storage is different than conventional hydro. These types of projects move water between two reservoirs located at different elevations in order to store energy and then generate that electricity.[[Page H9813]]  As we have learned through hearings at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the complete regulatory process places new pumped storage hydropower projects at a significant disadvantage.  Pumped storage hydro has been around for almost 100 years, but with more intermittent renewables coming online, the need for grid-scale storage is more important than ever. The current process to license pumped storage takes way too long and creates too much uncertainty, burdening consumers with additional unnecessary costs and preventing jobs and economic opportunities.  This bill makes important changes to the process to enable FERC to issue a decision in 2 years or less. The legislation also requires FERC to hold a workshop to explore potential opportunities for development of closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine sites.  This bill is a good, bipartisan bill. I thank Mr.Griffith for his hard work on this important issue and for working with our colleagues across the aisle to bring this bill to the floor.

But this bill goes far beyond providing a small exemption and tailored flexibility to captives and vehicle finance companies, as the proponents of this bill will have you believe, and something I am really ready to support. This bill will exempt all financial institutions from providing customers with annual privacy notices.  As currently drafted, under the bill, financial institutions such as payday lenders, check cash servicers, and large institutions like Wells Fargo are exempted from providing annual privacy notices and are unconstrained on who they can share their customers' personal information with. This goes far beyond the original intent of the bill.  As we have seen in the growing number of data breaches at companies like Equifax, the protection of consumers' personal information is something Congress must consider carefully.  While I continue to think that it makes sense for captive auto finance companies to have some degree of flexibility, to the extent they only share customers' personal information with the dealership, this legislation is far too broad.

265,topic-id,594,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their great work on this: Mr.Rush from Illinois and, of course, the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my friend, Mr.Upton, and our other committee members who put so much into these important pieces of legislation.  To date, the committee has worked in a bipartisan manner to examine and advance thoughtful solutions that prioritize consumers, support American businesses and jobs, and protect the environment. These commonsense, bipartisan bills we are considering today continue this very strong and bipartisan effort.  As many of you have heard me discuss before, hydropower plays an integral role in electricity generation across our great country as well as in my home State of In fact, nearly 43 percent of electricity in Oregon comes from this dependable base load power resource, and it has supported jobs along the Columbia River and throughout the  Two of the three bills under consideration today build upon the committee's work promoting this emissions-free energy resource. In fact, the House of Representatives has already passed 10 Energy and Commerce Committee bills that promote hydropower and modernize the licensing process so we can get these projects to market faster.  H.2872, the Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act, is authored by my good friend from Indiana and committee member, Larry Bucshon's legislation would promote hydropower development by expediting the licensing process for these types of facilities: dams that could have hydropower put on them, but don't right now. We want to take advantage of that power.  H.2872 also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, U.Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of the Interior to develop a list of existing nonpowered Federal dam facilities across the country that have the greatest potential for non-Federal hydropower development.  What we want to know is: Where are these dams already in existence so we can put a generator on, in effect, and generate electricity and create electricity without emission?  The second hydropower bill under consideration was authored by our distinguished Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee vice chairman, Morgan Griffith, from Now, Mr.Griffith's bill, H.2880, the Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower Act, unanimously passed the committee last week. This promotes what is called closed-loop pumped storage hydropower development by streamlining the licensing for such facilities.  Fundamentally, what happens is you generate power; and, when there is surplus power, it pumps, puts water on top of a reservoir, and then when you need to generate energy at peak times, the water comes back down through a pipe, through another generator, back into a lower elevation reservoir, and you repeat the cycle. It just really acts like a battery in some respects and produces, again, emissions, free hydropower.  The third bill under consideration today was authored by our committee member Representative Susan Brooks from Indiana, H.1733. Now, this directs the Secretary of Energy to update the Federal strategy for recycling used lubricating oil.  Recycling used lubricating oil provides environmental benefits, reduces energy consumption, which is important, and produces high-quality products for consumers across our country.  Mr.Speaker, cumulatively, these bills underscore the Energy and Commerce Committee's willingness to reach across the aisle and work together in a bipartisan way to find commonsense solutions that make a difference for people across the country that improve the environment and generate emissions-free energy.

752,topic-id,1246,"Mr.President, I stand today to talk about a different subject; that is, to stand in solidarity with over 12,000 of my Virginia constituents who are students, entrepreneurs, members of our military, and individuals who have the distinction of being Dreamers, like the nearly 800,000 Dreamers across our country.  These people, many of them young folks, are worried about facing deportation--not for anything they have done wrong but because the vast majority of these young people were brought to this country as children many years ago. Today, unfortunately, due to no actions of their own, they are caught up in some of the worst of our Nation's politics.  Up until this past September, these young people were living in the United States legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program or what has been called As part of this program, these young people came out of the shadows, paid a fee, went through an extensive background check, and complied with all the other requirements of the DACA Unfortunately, Dreamers and their families are now in a perilous situation because, unfortunately, President Trump ended the DACA Program, literally putting hundreds of thousands of these young people in a state of legal limbo.  Unfortunately, while a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to work through this problem, we hear the Republican leadership has done nothing to provide that permanent solution for these hard-working young That is who they are, folks who have lived here oftentimes for decades. This is not how the greatest country on Earth should treat anyone, especially these young people who, in most cases, have only one nation they have called home, and that is our country, the United  I am not the only one who thinks this. As I mentioned, there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been coming to the floor for weeks making this point. The fact is, more than three-quarters of Americans of all political stripes support a pathway to permanent legal status for Here in the Senate, my friends, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Dick Durbin, have introduced the bipartisan Dream Act and have been actively working toward its passage.  In the Senate and the House, there are enough votes to pass this bipartisan legislation if leadership would only bring it to the floor, and that is just not the case in the Last week, my friend Congressman Scott Taylor, a fellow Virginian and a Republican, led a bipartisan group of 30 Members in the House again asking the House leadership to find a legislative solution--not next year, not next month but now.  Unfortunately, it seems like folks on the other side of the aisle would rather[[Page S8041]]treat this as a political issue and a political pawn to be negotiated, probably not even this year but at some future date. By doing so, they leave these young people in a state of limbo and really subject to a great deal of legal uncertainty. For many of these young people, as they cycle out of the program--close to 1,000 a week--even if we come up with a legal solution, their ability to rejoin the program and reclaim their legal status may be extinguished. The truth is, this is not just another political leverage point.  Let me take a moment or two and talk about some of the folks who are affected in my State--folks in my State, folks whom I call real  I think about one young student from Northern Virginia, whom I chose as my guest to the President's State of the Union Address a few years ago. I was so impressed with her work ethic and her passion for improving the lives of others that I asked her to serve after that as an intern in my office, where she did great work serving fellow  I think about a law student I met recently in Williamsburg who was born in England and brought here when she was just 1 year old. Right now, it is getting close to the holidays. She is probably tucked away in some corner of the library studying for her law school exams. She told me she wanted to get that law degree to help fellow Virginians when she graduates. I say we shouldn't stand in her way.  I think again about a young man I met from Newport News whose mother brought him to the United States when he was just 6 years old. Sadly, his mother passed away before he graduated from high school, but I know when he walked across the stage of that graduation as valedictorian of his class, his mom would have been proud. Hopefully, if this program is renewed when he graduates from Virginia Tech next year with a degree in engineering, he will put those skills to work.  These are just a few examples about the smart, successful, young Virginians who also carry the categorization of being called The truth is, in Virginia, we have a vibrant and growing immigrant community that contributes to all facets of life in the  While I talk today about Dreamers, I also want to make mention of another program that is caught up in some of these last-minute negotiations, the so-called TPS individuals--oftentimes individuals from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and certain folks who have lived in this country for decades whose legal status is also in jeopardy.  The truth is, whether they are a Dreamer or someone who has been a beneficiary of the TPS Program, the truth is, immigrants in Virginia are all across our community. They are doctors, caretakers, small business owners, high-tech entrepreneurs. Quite honestly, they are also our next-door neighbors. They are motivated, talented individuals who want to help and continue contributing to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to our country.  What we tell them every day that we fail to act, every day that more and more of these young people fall out of eligibility, we tell them, in pretty direct ways, that actually even though they have served, studied, and worked here, that at least some in this Chamber don't really want them here. They would rather urge them to take their talents elsewhere.  As somebody who has been in business longer than I have been in politics, I can state that these young people are an enormous asset, and urging them to leave the Commonwealth or our country is a bad business decision.  As I said, unfortunately, with every day that passes, more and more Dreamers face the very real and terrifying prospect of being oftentimes sent to a country they barely know or may not know at all for an offense they were too young to even know they committed. That is just not right.  It is not right that their lives should hang in the balance as they wait and wait and wait for Congress to solve this problem--a problem that I know, if it were brought to the floor, would receive overwhelming bipartisan support.

If it passes, it could affect the lives of every single American for an entire generation.  Now, last night, the people of Alabama elected a new Senator to represent them here in So now Republicans who control the Senate face a choice. Will they allow Senator-elect Doug Jones to take his seat among his colleagues before a final vote on their tax plan?  We actually know something about that kind of choice in my home State of On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts elected a new Senator to represent them here in The result was just as shocking to Democrats as last night's result was to It also came when we were in the middle of another historically important policy debate here in Washington--healthcare. A lot of people thought Democrats should ram through the final version of their bill in Congress before Brown could be seated.  Now, I could stand here and read you quote after quote after quote from Republicans, who now control the Senate, talking about how unfair that would be, how corrupt that would be, and how anti-democratic that would be. I could go on and on about how today's Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this would be gamesmanship, but I am going to talk about what Democrats actually did.  Democrats rejected the idea of ramming through the bill before Brown could take his seat in the Almost immediately, Jim Webb, a Democratic Senator from Virginia, called for a suspension of any healthcare vote until after Brown arrived. The day after the Massachusetts election, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said publicly: ``We're going to wait until the new Senator arrives until we do anything more on health care.''  Massachusetts Democratic Senator John Kerry held a joint press conference with Republican Scott Brown that same week, where he said:       Seating Scott Brown as expeditiously as possible is      important. We want to respect the election results. And      nobody wants to delay this process.  President Obama, whose entire healthcare agenda was on the line, said this:       Here's one thing I know and I just want to make sure that      this is off the table: The Senate certainly shouldn't try to      jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated. People in      Massachusetts spoke. He's got to be part of that process.  Now, this wasn't an easy decision. Waiting for Brown slowed down the adoption of healthcare for 2 additional months. More importantly, it meant Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority and, as a consequence, the final bill couldn't achieve nearly as much as Democrats had hoped for, but we did it anyway.  We did it because democracy matters, even when it means it might slow down a President's agenda. Democracy matters, even when a Senate seat held for decades by a liberal lion is taken over by a conservative. Democracy matters, especially when it is inconvenient.  If we are honest, we know that there hasn't been a lot of democracy around this tax bill. This is a bill that was written and rewritten in the dead of night, behind closed doors. It is filled with errors and unintended consequences. It is animated by a rotten[[Page S7987]]wealth transfer from millions of hard-working Americans to a handful of corporations and billionaires.  But up until now, we have at least respected the principle that each State gets to pick its Senators, and those Senators get to vote for or against the final product. This afternoon, we are being told that Republicans have a final tax deal. Nobody has seen it, but we could be voting on it in the next couple of days. There is no reason to ram through that kind of massive restructuring of our economic system before Alabama gets its new Senator unless Republicans are concerned that their deal won't withstand a couple of more weeks of public scrutiny.  The election of Doug Jones will not change which party controls the The election of Doug Jones will not give him or Democrats the power to block the tax bill or any other piece of legislation, but it will respect the people of Alabama and their choice.

We pushed the bounds of human knowledge to do, see, and create things that fundamentally changed the way we live our lives. The government was right smack at the center of all of it, dedicating resources and manpower to explorations of science, medicine, engineering, and technology. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, was a product of that commitment, and it was there at DARPA that a bunch of government and government-funded researchers created the internet.  In the intervening decades, what started in that government Agency provided the building blocks for what we experience as the internet today. Creative minds in government, at colleges and universities, in businesses, and at homes and garages all across the country toyed and tinkered and pushed us into the digital age.  Today, internet use is nearly universal. Although internet access remains limited in many rural and low-income areas, students of all ages go online to access educational tools and conduct research for many school assignments. Entrepreneurs and small businesses sell goods and transact business online. Families come together to watch their favorite movies or shows. The internet and broadband services have become an important part of our lives.  Government is just as important now as it was back when the internet was created. By enforcing and implementing America's communications laws and rules, the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, plays a critical role in making sure that the internet remains fair and open.  In 2015, the FCC enshrined that commitment in an open internet order, establishing net neutrality rules--strong, public interest rules that prevented big companies from deciding how or when we use the internet, rules that have the overwhelming support of the vast majority of Americans, Republican or  But big internet companies don't want the FCC to work in the public interest; they want the internet to work for them. Long before the FCC passed net neutrality rules, those giants were working to establish control over the open internet. After net neutrality rules were passed, they stepped up their attack, deploying armies of lobbyists and lawyers and investing massive amounts of money to bury net neutrality rules.  Now they have the champagne chilled and ready to pop open. They have a President and a GOP-controlled Congress that is more interested in stuffing the pockets of the rich and powerful than taking care of the workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs, students, children, the sick, the elderly, and just about everybody else. President Trump's choice to lead the FCC, Ajit Pai, is dedicated to transforming the FCC from an agency that works in the public interest into a big business giveaway group.  Pai has been a vocal opponent of net neutrality rules for a very long time. After President Trump won the election, Pai gleefully declared that net neutrality's days were numbered. Pai claims that nondiscrimination rules harm giant internet companies by making it more difficult for them to create new and better products. He thinks that if these giants can discriminate against small businesses or individuals, then these giants can pick who gets the fast lane into your television set and who is stuck off on the dirt roads. If these giants can dictate which startups get a foothold and which ones are left on the ground, then the giants will be better off. Of course, he is right--the giants will be better off, but everyone else will be a lot worse off.  Chairman Pai is so committed to these internet giants that he is willing to rewrite the Federal rules in order to help them out. He is even willing to rewrite the rules so State and local governments won't be allowed to pass any consumer protection laws to protect their own citizens. Chairman Pai's notion of a fair and open internet is one that works for the highest bidder and it just leaves everyone else behind.  Tomorrow, the FCC will vote on whether to eliminate the protections that ensure that the internet remains fair and open to all Americans--protections that the vast majority of Americans support. Pai has barrelled full speed ahead despite disturbing reports that potentially hundreds of thousands of comments submitted during the public comment period were fake, and he has ignored the FCC's responsibility to turn over documents of consumer complaints about discriminatory behavior by internet providers.  If the FCC eliminates net neutrality protections, giant internet companies will pop open those champagne bottles. They will have the power to block access, to filter content, to charge more--three powerful ways that they will pick the next round of America's winners and losers. That is not the way it should work in The internet doesn't belong to big internet companies; it belongs to all of us, and all of us should be part of this fight.  Net neutrality matters. For the entrepreneur working around the clock on a shoestring budget to build an invention that can change the world, net neutrality matters. For the small family business that depends on online customers to keep its lights on and its doors open, net neutrality matters. For the blog writer or local journalist who works each day to bring us important news about our communities, our government, and our world, net neutrality matters. For every American who uses the internet for any reason, net neutrality matters.  Ingenuity is in America's It is that spirit of curiosity and adventure that has put us at the forefront of the search for what is next. Government works best when it makes sure everyone has equal access to the resources that make that possible.  In Massachusetts, Free Press, the Massachusetts Chapter of the ACLU, Fight for the Future, and countless other groups have led the fight to defend net neutrality and help citizens make their voices heard.  I urge every American to speak out about why net neutrality matters. I urge the FCC to abandon its plan to kill net neutrality rules, and I ask the FCC to defend an internet that is fair and open to all.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

1056,topic-id,1045,"Mr.President, 2 days ago, the GOP-controlled Senate confirmed Leonard Steven Grasz to a Federal appeals court. This is a man who is so aggressively ideological that he earned a rating of ``not qualified'' from the American Bar  The ABA reached that conclusion, in part, after speaking with many of Mr.Grasz's peers who expressed concerns ``that Mr.Grasz' strongly held social views and/or his deeply rooted political allegiances would make it impossible for him to have an unbiased and open mind on critical issues.''  Those individuals have ample reason to be concerned. Among his many appalling views, Mr.Grasz believes discrimination against LGBTQ individuals is A-He supports the harmful and discredited practice of conversion therapy and he opposes reproductive rights and the Republicans just confirmed him to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge who will make life-changing decisions for millions of  The other judicial nominee the GOP-controlled Senate confirmed this week, Donny Willett, doesn't fall very far from that tree either. Mr.Willett, a current justice on the Texas Supreme Court, isn't shy about his radical rightwing views. He has bragged about being the most conservative justice on the Texas Supreme Court, and he has a record to show for it.  Mr.Willett believes judges should be able to easily overturn State and local laws that protect workers, including minimum wage laws and laws that allow workers to unionize. This view is so out of the mainstream that other conservative judges, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge Robert Bork, have rejected him.  Mr.Willett's radical views don't stop there. He has ruled to limit the rights of same-sex couples. He has mocked transgender individuals. He has demonstrated hostility to issues that affect working women, including pay equity, discrimination, and sexual harassment. Mr.Willett has ruled against efforts to help remedy discrimination in Texas schools. On issue after issue, Mr.Willett's record shows a stunning disregard of the issues that impact millions of  The truth is, Mr.Grasz and Mr.Willett are not unique. They are just a few of the many nominees whose records show they cannot fairly and impartially dispense equal justice under the law.  Right now, the GOP-controlled Senate is executing a breathtaking plan to fill our courts with rightwing, radical nominees like Mr.Grasz and Mr.It is a plan that has been long in the making. For years, Republicans have worked hand in hand with billionaire-funded, rightwing groups to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy and the powerful over everyone else.  First, after President Obama was elected, Republicans abused the filibuster to stop reasonable mainstream judges from filling vacancies on Federal courts. They didn't stop those nominees because of their qualifications. They didn't stop them because of their records. The Republicans stopped those nominees because they didn't want judges who cared more about justice than about protecting the powerful.  Then, once the filibuster was gone and Republicans had gained the majority in the Senate, they slowed the judicial nominations process to a crawl. Vacancies stacked up, and the courts became overloaded with cases.  Finally, last year, Republicans took their assault on our judicial system to new heights, refusing to consider any nominee put forward by the President to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. They threw the Constitution and Senate precedent right out the window to advance their radical agenda. It was shocking, and it was shameful.  Now that there is a Republican President who is committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich and the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment, no matter how unqualified they may be.  This week, the Senate will vote on one more of those judicial nominees, James Ho, a man who, like Mr.Grasz and Mr.Willett, will work to hand our courts over to powerful, pro-corporate interests. When it comes to money and politics, Mr.Ho's view is the more the better. He has argued that there should be no limits on campaign contributions, none--democracy for sale. According to Mr.Ho, the reason government is so corrupt isn't because there is too much secret money slithering through our political system but because government makes it too hard for those big donors to succeed in the private sector.  Tell that to the working families, the students, the teachers, and the small businesses that will be paying higher taxes to give those fat cat donors giant tax cuts.  Mr.Ho has also defended discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. While he was solicitor general of Texas, Mr.Ho defended Texas's ban on same-sex marriage. More recently, he has heaped praise on a Federal district court nominee who, among other disgusting statements, said that transgender children are part of ``Satan's plan.''  Here is another troubling aspect of Mr.Ho's record: his view on whether torture is illegal. While Mr.Ho worked in the Justice Department, he authored a memo relating to the treatment of prisoners of war. That memo is cited in one of the torture memos that became the basis for the Bush administration's illegal and immoral practice of torturing terrorism suspects. That memo was not provided to the Judiciary Committee, and Mr.Ho has refused to fully answer questions regarding his involvement in what ultimately became the Bush administration's policy on torture--information that every Senator should demand to see before we vote on his nomination.  Grasz, Willett, and Ho--just about all of Trump's judicial nominees--have a lot in common. They will put powerful interests before the rights of workers, before the rights of women, before the rights of LGBTQ individuals, people of color, religious minorities, and pretty much everyone else. Their radical, rightwing views mean that in their courts, it will be easier for giant corporations and wealthy individuals to get relief and harder for everyone else to find justice. That is the perverted, upside-down justice system that every Member of this Congress should be working to fix.  Now more than ever, we need judges who will stand up for equal justice for all, not just for the rich and the powerful. The records of the nominees before us this week show that they cannot meet that standard. That is why I voted no on the nominations of Mr.Grasz and Mr.Willett, and that is why I will be voting no on Mr.I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I yield.

175,topic-id,1975,"Mr.President, I am here for my 189th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech to discuss the Republican tax bill. Who knew? Folks watching today's debate from home are probably wondering what the tax bill has to do with climate change. That is a good question. They might also ask, as I do, why the tax bill includes massive giveaways to fossil fuel producers or what opening up precious wilderness to oil drilling has to do with tax reform.  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said: ``We need a simpler tax code that puts more money back into the pockets of workers and families.'' Republicans, he said, want to create ``a fairer, more predictable system for taxpayers across the country.''  Their tax plan is none of those things. Its benefits are weighted heavily to big corporations, not workers and families. The corporate tax cuts are permanent, while the modest breaks for some workers disappear after a few years. What is fair or predictable about that?  The chairman also said:       I want a bipartisan process that renders a bipartisan      result. . . . I think we need a vigorous and open debate in      the Senate, which, in my view, should include a full process      in committee and regular order on the Senate floor.  We got none of that. Republicans have rammed this bill through, using every procedural and parliamentary trick at their disposal, as a purely partisan measure, in the dead of night, producing amendments in handwritten chicken scratch in the margins of the bill at the last minute.  If we were to ask middle-class families their top priorities for fixing our tax system, I don't think very many would say: You know, we really need to let oil companies pump crude in an Alaskan wildlife refuge. But that is what they do.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 to preserve ``unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational values.'' It now encompasses almost 20 million acres, with around 8-million acres designated as wilderness. The U.Fish and Wildlife Service manages the refuge, which is roadless, trailless, and represents the best of wild Alaska in a world where wilderness is increasingly scarce and vanishing far too fast.  The Republican tax bill opens the refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain to the oil drillers. Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development does little to provide energy security. The oil-producing potential of the area is estimated by the U.Geological Survey to be, at a maximum, around 12 billion barrels total of recoverable oil. In 2016, the United States consumed 7.2 billion barrels of petroleum products just in that year. So all of the oil we get from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which will take decades, represents fewer than 2 years of current consumption, and that is according to the most optimistic estimate.  The budget resolution required that this venture raise $1 billion over 10 years. Republicans need that $1 billion to fund the big tax cuts they are giving out to the wealthy and to big corporations. When the numbers were finally crunched, though, drilling in that Arctic coastal plain couldn't produce those numbers. Did this reality dissuade my Republican colleagues? Instead, they have proposed to make up the difference by selling off 7 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--the United States' emergency supply of crude oil, which actually does help guarantee our energy security. They want to sell reserve oil to fund those cuts for the wealthy and the big corporations.  An auction last week of oil and gas leases in another part of Northern Alaska bodes ill for Republican hopes about drilling in the wilderness preserve. On 900 tracts of land offered up to oil and gas companies, the Bureau of Land Management fielded just seven bids--900 tracts of land, 7 bids.  Why is that?  For one thing, low prices for crude oil make the prospect of exploring undeveloped Alaskan wilderness less appealing. In general, current industry appetite for high-risk ``frontier'' exploration is very low, observed an energy analysis at Raymond James & The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ``would suffer from much the same thing.''  A second problem is that oil companies are likely overstating their achievable existing reserves already. They will have to leave a lot in the ground of what they are now claiming as reserves. Buying more when you cannot sell what you already have is not a great strategy. Low-cost renewables and excess supply will further drive oil prices down and down if the laws of supply and demand hold true.  This may be one reason the World Bank just announced in this new story, dated 2 days ago, that it will end its financial support for oil and gas exploration within the next 2 years. It is in response to the growing threat that is posed by climate change. That is where they are going. We are going the wrong way.  The sad irony of Arctic drilling is that the American Arctic will feel the effects of burning fossil fuels most severely. The U.Global Change Research Program's ``Climate Science Special Report,'' authored by scientists and experts from top universities and across the Federal Government, found that while all regions of the United States will see significant warming by the end of the century, Alaska is expected to take the hardest hit--potentially over 12 degrees Fahrenheit warmer by 2100, which is under the high-emission scenario shown down here at the bottom right.  The northern edge of Alaska, including the historic whale-hunting village of Utqiagvik--and please forgive me, the people of Utqiagvik, for mangling the village's pronunciation--could see temperature increases of 18 degrees This village, which is only about 300 miles west of the area in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge targeted for oil and gas development, is already seeing its coastlines overrun by rising seas, its permafrost melting beneath its buildings, and its beaches washing out to sea in strong winter storms as the protective shoreline sea ice forms later and later each year.  Here is another news flash from Utqiagvik: 320 miles north of the Arctic Circle, a weather station in America's northernmost city of Utqiagvik has been collecting temperature data since the 1920s. Just recently, the average temperature went so off the chart at the weather station there that the instrumentation shut down the recording because the algorithm that monitored this figured that something must have gone wrong with the instrumentation because the numbers were so out of whack.  The numbers were not out of whack. It was actually very real climate change that changed the environment and sent that signal that blew through the algorithm that the scientists had set up.  But, in this building, in this room, the warnings from our best scientists about the consequences of our carbon emissions just don't count. The hyped economics about oil drilling don't count here. The weird budgetary jujitsu required to shoehorn this environmental hit into a tax bill doesn't matter here. What matters here is that the oil companies want to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and so Republicans are making it happen.  Republicans claim to be cleaning up the Tax Code, but their so-called tax reform leaves in place most of the oil and tax giveaways that have benefited that industry for decades. The Big Oil giants, like BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, have enjoyed nearly $1 trillion in profits over the past 10 years. Yes, let's rush to their assistance. Never mind the beleaguered American families, many of whom will see taxes go up from this bill. Let's rush to the defense of those companies with $1 trillion in profits over the past 10 years. They continue to benefit from multibillion-dollar tax subsidies.  I am proud to have repeatedly cosponsored Senator Menendez's bill that would close the loopholes for the Big Oil giants, saving $22 billion for taxpayers and debt holders over the next decade. The Republican bill not[[Page S8040]]only leaves most of the old loopholes in place, but it offers new giveaways to the oil and gas industries. A last-minute change scribbled in during the Senate vote-arama will allow traded oil and gas partnerships to use the so-called passthrough loophole that the Republicans claim is designed to help small businesses.  While the Republican tax plan boosts the fossil fuel polluters with this new tax gift, it singles out renewable energy to undermine those jobs. The way this works is that, under the historic bipartisan agreement that many of us worked on in 2015, developers of new wind energy were given a period in which tax credits for projects for which construction begins by the end of 2019 would be protected. There was a bargain struck in this body. We came together, and we agreed on a bipartisan result. This tax bill breaks that deal and breaks that result for wind and for solar. For wind, it was until the end of 2019. For solar, it was through 2021.  These tax credits have been vital to the growth of the renewable industry across the country. It has grown in red States and in blue In fact, the five States that get the largest percentage of their electricity from wind and that have all of those wind energy jobs are Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and North Texas produces the most wind power of any The Republican tax bill is likely to upend the progress that we have made on renewables, disrupt ongoing projects, and ruin those jobs--all with clever provisions, the trick being to render those renewable tax credits that we bargained for practically valueless.  Renewable developers don't usually turn a profit in the early years. So they don't have taxes against which to apply the tax credits. They sell the tax credits to others, and they use the revenue from selling the tax credits to support those wind and solar investments. The clever fossil fuel trick in the Senate bill--specifically, the corporate AMT and base erosion so-called provisions--would make these credits worthless to the businesses that have been buying them. With no buyers for the tax credits, funds for new wind and solar projects will dry up.  There is even more nonsense in the House bill that takes direct aim at the wind and solar credits, including changing the rules on how projects would qualify for the credits, not just in the future but also retroactively. They go back to undo deals that have already been done. So $20 billion in projects have frozen up, developers say, just from the threat of these changes.  Renewable energy industry organizations, including the American Wind Energy Association, the American Council on Renewable Energy, the American Conservation Coalition, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, the Conservative Energy Network, and Conservatives for Clean Energy, all warn that the tax bill will jeopardize growth and jobs in wind and solar projects.  ``If these provisions are retained,'' the groups wrote to Senators, ``they will result in broad instability and uncertainty for businesses and investors across many sectors, including the clean energy sector.''  Gosh, I hope my Republican friends will listen to our wind and solar producers, particularly the ones in their home I hope they will listen to the people who are counting on the jobs of those $20 billion in projects that have now been put on the shelf. I hope they will listen to American taxpayers, who are sick of midnight-deal corporate welfare like this.  If they do listen, they can scrap this terrible bill. They can sit down and work with It would be a novelty, but we would welcome it. We could have a bipartisan tax bill that works for the middle class, for the economy, and for the environment, but with the oil and gas industry calling the shots around here, fat chance of that.

It was the Obama Treasury Department that highlighted the role that Iran and Iranian aircraft played in the destabilizing activity across the Middle East and in supporting the atrocities committed by the rogue Assad regime in  On September 9, 2012, David Cohen, the Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under President Obama, released the following statement:  ``The identification of Iranian aircraft also further highlights Iran's ongoing effort to support the Assad regime's weapons of mass destruction programs and crackdown against the Syrian people.''

194,topic-id,359,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.3979, the Keep America's Refuges Operational Act, reauthorizes the National Wildlife Refuge System volunteer, community partnership, and education programs for fiscal years 2018 through 2022.  I am proud to have joined with my good friend from New York (Mr.Jeffries) to support conservation efforts at our Nation's wildlife refuges in a way that is also fiscally responsible.  Each year the refuge system's volunteer, community partnership, and education programs facilitate more than 1.4 million hours of service from more than 40,000 volunteers in support of our Nation's wildlife refuge system. The valuable contributions of these volunteers help maintain our Nation's 566 refuges, 14 of which I am proud to say are in the Commonwealth of  These programs help ensure that Americans can visit, explore, fish, hunt, and study wildlife for generations to come. As a kid, I spent most of my time outdoors, and today, I still frequently visit the Rappahannock River Wildlife Refuge in my district. I have long appreciated the value of nature and wildlife in our society as well as the importance of environmental stewardship.  Volunteers perform a wide variety of tasks to assist with our refuge operations. Examples of these tasks include habitat improvement projects, laboratory research assistance, leading refuge tours, conducting fish and wildlife population surveys, and much more. All of these tasks help the Fish and Wildlife Service more efficiently fulfill its mission while also providing an opportunity for individuals and groups to contribute to the preservation and protection of our Nation's wildlife and public lands.                              {time}  1715  H.3979 reauthorizes the cost-efficient resource that helps the U.Fish[[Page H10155]]and Wildlife Service fulfill its mission to protect and preserve the Nation's fish and wildlife.

This truly is what makes our Nation great: individuals willing to give of their time to work on these refuges.  Many times, the ability to access those refuges is dependent upon those volunteers. We take a few resources and stretch them across the Nation on many of these refuge lands, and it is our volunteers who, many times, help in maintaining these lands and making sure that there is access and making sure that people who come to visit understand the true value and nature of the resources that are there.  It is, truly, I think, a great example of what makes our country great: people willing to put their time and effort into these refuges and making sure they, indeed, can be enjoyed by all.

708,topic-id,1946,"Mr.President, I introduced the Senate's first strong net neutrality bill back in 2006. I rise today to give my strongest possible condemnation of what the Federal Communications Commission's head, Mr.Pai, is seeking to do, which is to roll back protections that ensure a truly free and open internet for our people.  This is a handout. It is a holiday gift to a collection of giant internet companies to increase their profits at the expense of the consumer.  Before I actually begin my remarks, I see Senator Franken is on the floor, as well. I would like the public to know how important his leadership has been on these issues. He and I have partnered on these issues ever since he came to the He was on the key committee, the Judiciary He has been a go-to figure in a key spot on this issue.  I want to continue this discussion after Senator Warren's terrific presentation. I know my colleague is going to speak on this, as well.  I want the public to know that Senator Franken has made a big difference for the consumer on these issues. Those[[Page S7988]]of us who have been toiling in these precincts are very appreciative of what he has done.  I want people to understand what net neutrality is, because Senator Franken and I have talked about this over the years. I think there is a little confusion over what it is. Net neutrality means that after you pay your internet access fee, you get to go where you want, when you want, and how you want. It is the essence of ensuring that everybody gets a fair shake, that all bits are created equal. It is the foundation of what has kept the internet free and open.  Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want people to understand what happens if you don't have net neutrality. If you don't have net neutrality, in effect, big companies can manipulate who is going to win and who is going to lose in the marketplace. They will continue to manipulate who wins and who loses until and after we get fewer services and the consumer gets higher prices. So this is not some kind of abstract discussion.  Let me flesh out some of these remarks for a few minutes because I know my colleagues have been waiting, as well.  Since the origins of the internet, the defining feature has been that all information--all bits, as we know it--gets the same fair shake. If you are a big company or a mom-and-pop ice cream shop with a website, your content gets to everybody's home at the same speed. That is what net neutrality is all about. Net neutrality keeps internet service providers from favoring one type of content over another.  The market has changed since 2006 because the market for access to the internet has changed. Where once there were legions of dial-up providers and DSL resellers, we were seeing a few monopolies and duopolies dominating neighborhoods across the country. With their power to dictate where you could go and what you could see on the net, they had and continue to have the power to suppress those sites and those services that you would have chosen yourself in a free marketplace, driving them out of business.  Again, to lay out what this means for people who are following this, that means that instead of Netflix, YouTube, or Amazon, you could be forced to get your video content from something called go90, whatever the heck that is. It certainly isn't a service that has been able to compete in a free internet market. But all that changes when Verizon can charge you more to get to YouTube or Facebook than it costs to reach their own service.  Without strong net neutrality protections, AT&T might provide--and we always put it in quotes--``free data'' for customers streaming That is pretty good if you watch HBO, but without net neutrality, it could starve other creators and subscribers necessary to survive, until soon enough, as Senator Franken has pointed out in some of our discussions, free data is gone. That is it. Free data goes away, and the American consumer--which is my fear when you think about what it really means to somebody sitting in Minnesota at home, and I see my colleague Senator Merkley from Oregon as well. The free data goes away under what I described, and the consumer at home in Minnesota or Oregon is stuck with few choices at higher prices than they have today. That is what the loss of net neutrality means.  I care deeply, as my colleagues do, about innovation and startups and small businesses. Senator Warren was eloquent on this point. There are going to be a lot of people who aren't a startup. They are going to ask: What does it mean to me? What it means--I have just walked people through an example--is, that typical person is going to be stuck with fewer choices at higher prices.  Two years ago, Tom Wheeler, then the head of the Federal Communications Commission, put in place a strong framework, something with teeth that was enforceable, called title II of the Communications Act, to make sure the government, the FCC, had the tools to protect net neutrality.  Chairman Wheeler, like Chairman Pai, worked for industry for much of his career in Washington, but rather than serve his former employers, Tom Wheeler said: I am going to use my experience working in the private sector, my experience in how companies operate, to design and implement constructive and effective consumer protections. What a contrast between the two Chairs of the Federal Communications Both of them are from industry. Both of them did well in industry. We consider it a good thing in America that we have a prospering private economy. Tom Wheeler used it and that expertise to help the public. That is not what we are seeing today.  There isn't any need to fix what isn't broken. There are strong net neutrality protections in place right now. Since the 2015 rules went into place, our economy has grown up around this leading principle of equal access to information and customers.  The day before Thanksgiving, Chairman Pai released his proposal to strike down the 2015 rules that ensure real net neutrality but also prevent States from introducing their own approach to net neutrality.  Rather than listening to the millions of voices who spoke up on behalf of real net neutrality and against this proposal to allow pay-for-play or what I really call--I say to the Senator from Minnesota--a trickle-down telecommunications policy, which is to just let the big guys make as much money as they want, and maybe something eventually trickles down to rural Minnesota or rural  Chairman Pai is going to keep pushing pay-for-play and is expected to ignore the will of the public and demolish net neutrality rules.  The first key vote is tomorrow, December 14. What I have been doing is spending a good chunk of my waking hours--obviously, we have the tax issue, which is enormously important. This is enormously important, too, to tell the American people this is a time to make their voices heard. My message to the American people on net neutrality is to get loud. This debate is far from over.  We know Chairman Pai plays a strong hand tomorrow--there is no question about that--but then it goes to the courts. Some of our colleagues are looking at approaches here on the floor. I want, as much as anything, to make sure the American people know we understand--Senator Franken and Senator Merkley--that political change doesn't start in government buildings in Washington, DC, and trickle down is bottoms up. If ever there was an issue for bottoms up, it is net neutrality.  Not only are the majority of Americans opposed to Chairman Pai's proposal, many of the comments solicited for input are fake. These fake comments have been attributed to bots and false identities or linked to Russian IP addresses.  Any argument that this agency, the Federal Communications Commission, has a transparent process with comments from the American people is not true. This is not government for the people. This is government for the special interests.  Just a couple of other points, and let me wrap this up so my colleagues can have the floor.  Chairman Pai has been out there arguing falsely, in my view, that without title II protections, Big Cable will make more money and use those profits to invest in infrastructure. This is what I call the trickle-down theory about telecommunications.  First of all, the existing regime was called title II--tough rules. It has not been a roadblock in investment and broadband. In fact, cable giants have continued to invest in broadband infrastructure even when strong net neutrality protections were put in place in 2015.  Publicly available documents show that investment by internet service providers was 5 percent higher during the 2 years after strong net neutrality rules were adopted than for the 2 years prior. Comcast, for example, has increased its investment by 25 percent since 2013.  Big Cable, in their own statements, show that none of the major internet service providers told their investors that net neutrality protections negatively impact their investments. That is based on publicly verifiable documents.  What we have is Chairman Pai making the argument that net neutrality provisions with teeth are going to be pretty much the end of investment and sort of Western civilization as we know it. Public documents show otherwise.[[Page S7989]]Publicly available documents show otherwise.  The FCC Chairman once claimed that a policy of voluntary net neutrality would be another way to go. Any talk of a voluntary solution to net neutrality is just nonsense.  Allowing a net neutrality provider to follow net neutrality has about as much of a chance of working--there is about as much of a chance that the big cable companies will honor voluntary net neutrality as there is of getting Ava and William Wyden, my 10-year-old twins, to voluntarily limit the number of desserts they have at dinner. It is not going to happen. It is not going to happen, folks. It is not going to work for open and fair access to the internet; it wouldn't work with Ava and Will  On the same exact date as the Federal Communications Commission produced its rulemaking rollback to title II, Comcast removed the pledge on its website that it does not prioritize internet traffic or create paid fast lanes--so much for voluntary policy.  In my view, the only way the potential of the internet can be fully tapped is by ensuring that one form of content is not provided a preference over another form of content by their internet service provider.  The Trump Federal Communications Commission is barreling ahead to blow up this level playing field that is so crucial to innovation and free speech.  I close only by way of saying that this is also a lifeline for the startups. Those startups are dreaming of being the next YouTube, Google, or eThis is not about Google or eThis is about the startups.  I would be staying to hear my colleague Senator Franken make his remarks on net neutrality but for the fact that we are about to start the tax conference. I close my remarks where I opened them. Senator Franken has been our go-to person on these issues since he came to the We are so grateful he looked at this issue through the prism of what it means for the person without power and clout.

He will be sorely missed.  Doug grew up on a cattle ranch in Madras, OR, where he soaked up the natural beauty of his dramatic surroundings. It was there that his passion for landscape architecture first took hold. That passion grew as Doug studied landscape architecture at the University of Oregon and moved to Portland where he founded the urban design firm Walker  Doug blended his passionate advocacy for the protection of Oregon's natural treasures with his dedication to civic causes, the arts, and beautifying outdoor spaces. Through his design firm, he has influenced and mentored generations of landscape architects who have shaped cities and public spaces across the Pacific Northwest and beyond.  Anyone who has visited my hometown of Portland has felt Doug's influence in his designs of some of the city's most beloved spaces, including Pioneer Courthouse Square, Waterfront Park, and the Vietnam Veterans of Oregon He was behind much of the revitalization that turned downtown Portland into a thriving, diverse, and green city where so many people enjoy living.  Visitors can also get a sense of Doug's love of nature in his designs for projects at national parks, including Crater Lake, private natural preserves like Opal Creek Ancient Forest Center, the scenic wonders of the Columbia River Gorge, State parks such as Oregon's Cottonwood Canyon, and hundreds of municipal parks and open spaces. Doug's work didn't stop there; his work can also be seen on college campuses, museums, vineyards, hospitals, and scenic highways.  In addition, Doug was a selfless citizen who donated his time and professional expertise to a countless number of causes, such as the Pacific Northwest College of Art, the Portland Parks Foundation, and the Portland Japanese Garden, which recently opened an expansion designed with Doug's guidance.

838,topic-id,1643,"Mr.President, a number of Senators have inquired about the status of the tax legislation and, particularly, the prospect of a real conference committee. It is clear that Republicans are talking among themselves, but apparently they feel, with respect to Democrats, this is a conference in name only.  What I would like to do is spell out what we know to date and talk a bit about what would really be in the public's interest. Specifically, late last night, the public learned through the press that Republicans have made no progress--their words, not mine--with respect to the tax bill.  They said that all of the major issues were still outstanding. Then, when all of them got up and made their way through their breakfast cornflakes, we were told that, magically, everything had just been worked out--that everything was worked out and that this bill would be ready to go.  I know they have been trying to move at the speed of light. We had yet another dose of fake math yesterday when the Treasury Department reported its so-called analysis to project that this bill would generate great growth, when, in fact, it comes up $1 trillion short. So I would like to make sure the public understands what is on offer as of right now.  My sense is, with respect to the key issue, which is the well-being of the middle class, millions and millions of middle-class people are going to get hurt by this legislation, millions of them very quickly--for example, millions are going to lose their health insurance coverage. Millions more are going to have high premiums. By 2027, half of the middle class in America will actually be paying more in taxes.  Senate Republicans seem to be talking about a variety of issues, but not one of the tax issues they are talking about involves bettering the quality of life for America's middle class. We don't hear any discussion of that. We hear plenty of discussion about multinational corporations. We hear plenty of discussion about rates. We hear discussions about pass-through businesses. But all of this is really like rearranging the chairs at the country club. Maybe one day the multinational corporations will do a little bit better; maybe the next day well-off heirs will do a little better. What I heard at my recent town hall meetings is that the American people want to make sure that the middle class is not always getting the shaft. They want to make sure, for example, that in the tax law, the breaks for the multinational corporations aren't permanent and the breaks for the middle class aren't temporary. They want everybody to have a chance to get ahead. It is not too late to change course.  There are 17 moderate Democrats, led by our colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator Kaine, who have said that they are hungry for a bipartisan approach to bringing both sides together. I have introduced two comprehensive, bipartisan bills with senior conservative Republicans--close allies of Mitch McConnell's. We have made it very clear that we want a bipartisan bill.  In that all of these changes are now being discussed and our fellow Americans can read about them in the press, take a look and see if you see one idea--even one--that is going to make life better for the vast majority of working Americans, the folks who work so hard day in and day out, who are walking on an economic tightrope, trying to save money and trying to educate their kids. We don't hear about one single idea--not one--that would make life better for the middle class.  We will have more to say about this tomorrow as, I gather, there may be some kind of ceremonial conference committee that is scheduled as they try to sort through all of these reports that they are getting from lobbyists on K Street because, I guess, lobbyists know lots about what the Republicans in the leadership and on the conference committee are talking about.  I want Americans to just read through all of this and look, line by line, to try to find anything that is going to make life better for the middle class, because I cannot find it. That, as much as anything, shows what is wrong with the way this legislation is being pursued.  What a difference from the way Ronald Reagan pursued tax reform. Ronald Reagan said point blank that the working person should at least get as good a deal as the investor. He said that we ought to have the same rate of taxation for workers as we have for investors. In fact, with Ronald Reagan--and I voted for his bill--the corporations, in effect, gave up some money to help the workers. Now what we are seeing is the workers getting the short end of the stick so that the multinational corporations can do even better. We will have more to say tomorrow.  I urge people to look through all of these stories and all of these press reports and see if they can find anything that involves a change to make life better for the hard-working middle class of our country.                         Remembering Vera Katz  Mr.President, I also come this afternoon to talk about the passing of a vintage Oregonian and an extraordinary[[Page S7964]]woman--Vera Katz--who became Oregon's first speaker of our house of representatives in 1985. After serving three terms as speaker, Vera Katz won Portland's mayoral race in 1992. The Oregonian noted recently that she moved Portland to become a ``nationally recognized destination city,'' with developments ranging from the Portland Streetcar to the East  I hope that all Oregonians and visitors to our city will stop by the bronze sculpture of Mayor It captures perfectly her strength and her warmth. She was an extraordinary person whom we think about today, not just because of her memorable accomplishments but because of her extraordinary spirit. It was indomitable. She could not be subdued when she took on an important cause.  I remember in 1996, when floodwaters on the Willamette River threatened to overwhelm downtown Portland, that, in the middle of this chaos, this very slight but still unbelievably powerful woman, Vera Katz, led hundreds of volunteers to mount what we came to call a sandbags-and-plywood defense against the floodwater. That was quintessential Vera  In my townhalls at home, we often speak of the ``Oregon way''--just finding the best ideas, looking for solutions, not standoffs. She lived and breathed that ``Oregon way'' ethos every day of her life. I am going to miss her, and I am especially going to miss some moments that will never be forgotten.  When we were working in the early seventies and I had gotten involved with the elderly, back then--I think the Presiding Officer, the Senator from North Dakota, probably remembers these days--that was a time when, if a town had a lunch program for senior citizens, that was a big deal. Nobody was aware that we might have all of the services that we now have--in-home services and a variety of transportation services. Back then, if a town had a lunch program for older people, that was a big deal. Vera Katz was then in the legislature, and I had been running the legal aid office for the elderly and was codirector of the Gray All of the senior citizens wanted to really focus on holding down the cost of medicine, and they told me one day: We are going to go to the legislature, and we are going to take all of our pill bottles and stack them up on the table and show those legislators what it is like to really be an older person in having to cut pills in half in our trying to find a way to make ends meet.  As the Presiding officer, the Senator from North Dakota, knows, I had never been involved in politics or in public service back then. All I really wanted to do was to play in the So I didn't know if you could do that. I didn't know if you could take all of the pill bottles to the legislature, so I called Vera  I said: The seniors want to come down, Representative They want to hold up all the bottles. I really don't know what to do.  I could hear it through the phone because it just boomed out.  She said: The seniors want to bring their pill bottles to wake up the legislature?  I said: Yes, ma'am.  I could hear it through the phone when she said: Damn right. I want them to bring their pill bottles, and they are going to get a big welcome from me.  In all of those years in working with senior citizens, the very first person the seniors wanted to see was Vera  I asked them: How come we are always going to see Vera Katz?  They said: Because she always inspires us, and she always makes us laugh, and she always makes us want to get involved.  So this life force who, like my family, fled the Nazis, was an extraordinary public figure. Yes, she represented Portland, but she always stood up for all of  In the days ahead, I will be back to the floor to talk some more about Vera She had a watermelon spitting contest with folks in rural Oregon just because she wanted to cement the bond between Portland and the rural part of the She was a wonderful woman. Our State grieves today as we think of her and her extraordinary contributions. In my having known her for more than 40 years, she is a role model for what public service ought to be all about.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

866,topic-id,1404,"Mr.President, I think that we are going to be joined here in a few moments by our colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, who, for years and years, has been leading the fight for the Dreamers--for the young people who are affected by He may be tied up for a bit, but as we begin--because we are going to be in a colloquy on some of these issues--I want to recognize his extraordinary contributions.  Nobody has been more focused and more relentless in terms of standing up for the rights of the Dreamers--the young people and the families who are caught up in DACA--than Senator Durbin, the senior Senator from Illinois, and I want to make sure that his role is recognized at the outset.  I and Senator Merkley have spent a lot of time talking to these young people at home in our State, and we have held special forums on it. I am just stunned at what wonderful young people these folks are. Inevitably, their grades are at the top of their classes. They seem to be working two jobs, and they are sending money to relatives. They are just doing everything that we associate with hard work and thrift and ingenuity and with what has made our country so unique and so special in the world.  I want to talk a little bit about what I have heard and also set the record straight with respect to DACA, because there is an awful lot of reckless talk about this legislation, and much of it just does not resemble the truth. Misinformation is being spread to discredit DACA recipients and their contributions to the country, and those innocent lives are being damaged. Right now, Dreamers face the very real and frightening threat that they may be ripped away from the only lives that they know and the only country that they have ever known, and I want to spell out why.  The Congress is now up against an artificial deadline that was created by this President in his scrambling to come up with a solution for the 11,000 DACA recipients in Oregon and the hundreds of thousands all over the country. If nothing is done in the Congress this year, we know that these young people are going to be fearful, and they are going to go into the holidays while wondering what is ahead for them and their families. I just feel so strongly that they deserve better. They shouldn't be hanging in suspended animation--wondering what is going to happen to them, living in fear. My hope is that there will be action taken this year to help these young people. I feel so strongly that the end-of-the-year wrapup legislation has to include legislation to finally allow these young people to realize their hopes and dreams in this country.  In his statement that announced the end of the DACA Program, the Attorney General said that our country must enforce our immigration laws, and he implied that the failure to enforce the laws somehow puts our country at risk of crime, violence, and terrorism. I can just say that, based on everything I have seen in Oregon, DACA recipients have not put our country at an increased risk of crime and terrorism, because, in fact, they are vital contributors to our Nation's success, including many who serve in our military.  It is just wonderful, and it is so good to see our colleague from Nevada here, who, along with Senator Durbin, has championed the rights and interests of these young people. I know that she is going to speak shortly because she has seen the real-life consequences--the dangers--that are being inflicted on our young friends, our neighbors, and those who are so fearful about what will happen if Congress does not act before the end of the year.  This is not an abstraction for those like Mariana Medina, whose family[[Page S7966]]brought her to the United States when she was 3. She went on to graduate from Tigard High School, which is just outside my hometown of This past June, Mariana graduated from Portland State University with a bachelor's degree in political science. She speaks eloquently and powerfully about how she really wants to give back to the people of Oregon by helping the children and the families who are most in need of help. What a wonderful role model Mariana is.  The debate is just as real for Ricardo Lujan, who graduated from Southern Oregon University in the spring. Ricardo is now the legislative director for the Oregon Student There, he has been a strong advocate for legislation to give Oregon Dreamers a chance to get their own higher education degrees.  Ricardo worked full time while going to school full time in order to pay for essentials. He said: I want to make sure that I am contributing to affording an apartment and a car. He said that without DACA, he would not have his bachelor of science degree today. He said that this law is a beacon of hope to young people like himself.  In Oregon, there are now an estimated 11,000 All of these young people have parents and brothers and sisters and friends and people who know them in the community because they always want to help and chip in. They have roots in these communities. They have well-laid plans to work hard in school, make something of their lives, and start families of their own here in our country.  It seems to me that with the groundswell of support for these Dreamers, before the end of this year, this Congress ought to be able to come up with a bipartisan, fair way to put an opportunity path forward for these young The effort from the White House, I have to say, and I regret it, to punish these young people and split families seems to run contrary to the values we hold dear as  Our government, by the way, made a promise to these young people when the government encouraged them to share their stories publicly, submit to background checks, and pay taxes. That was something the government urged these young people to do--come forward, pay taxes, submit to background checks. We want to make sure that we are in a position--and I was hopeful when I heard about that pledge--to take action based on the fact that these young people were willing to come forward and say: We want to be contributing members of our country. We want to make sure that when the government asks us to come forward, we do. And they did so.  I close with this, because I know my colleague wants to speak--perhaps on the same subject--it would be wrong to turn our backs on these exceptional young people. I know my colleague from Nevada is going to keep fighting tooth and nail alongside so many of our colleagues.  Senator Durbin was going to join me for a colloquy on some of these issues, and with the end of the year legislation barrelling toward us, I think he was detained, but I want to thank him for his leadership. In fact, he has joined us now.  With the indulgence of my friend from Nevada, I would like to recognize my colleague from Illinois because no one in this Senate has put in the time or shown the tenacity and the years-long commitment to make this fight for justice for the Dreamers and those who are trying to work their way through the DACA Program to a better future for themselves and their communities. So I am very grateful to the Senator from  I had mentioned in his absence that we thought at one time we would have a full-scale colloquy, and I have pretty much used up my time in terms of making some of the points about issues we have raised. With the indulgence of our friend from Nevada, I want to again thank the Senator from We are on the cusp of being able to finally get justice to these Dreamers and those in DACA, and I want this body and people who are following this issue to know that we would not be in this position without the help and the advocacy of the senior Senator from  I appreciate my friend from Nevada allowing us to have time for the Senator from  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-12-12-pt1-PgS7965-2.txt,1247,REMEMBERING JAMES DOUGLAS MACY,2017.0,12.0,December
