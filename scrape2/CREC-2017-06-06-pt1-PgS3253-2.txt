                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the fountain of wisdom, You are more majestic than the 
mountains. Give our lawmakers the reverence for You that will motivate 
them to do Your will. May they labor to enhance Your glory, striving to 
make our Nation and world stronger and better. Lord, help them to honor 
Your Name, cherishing the fact that they belong to You. Show them how 
to use today's fleeting moments to accomplish Your purposes. Sanctify 
their thoughts, words, and deeds. May they set You always before them 
as their guide, keeping You close so that they will not be shaken.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
