               CONGRATULATING FAIRVIEW SOUTHDALE HOSPITAL

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Fairview Southdale 
Hospital in Edina for recently receiving the 2018 Distinguished 
Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence from Healthgrades.
  Fairview Southdale was also named one of the country's top 100 best 
hospitals for cardiac care, coronary intervention, and pulmonary care. 
Distinguished hospitals are determined and measured by whether they 
achieve outstanding outcomes in at least 21 of 23 common conditions and 
procedures.
  Patients who are treated in these hospitals, on average, face a lower 
risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals without this 
designation. These hospitals also achieve better clinical results than 
95 percent of hospitals across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, the doctors, the nurses, the staffs at Fairview do 
incredible work, and I know they deserve this recognition, and we also 
know their patients are in good hands.
