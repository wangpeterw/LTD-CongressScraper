                        TRIBUTE TO ASA JERNIGAN

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Asa 
Jernigan, the Nassau County Teacher of the Year from Fernandina Beach 
Middle School in Fernandina Beach, FL.
  Asa's dedication to both his students and profession led to him being 
named Teacher of the Year. For 34 years, Asa has taught at both the 
middle and high school levels. His bands have earned the accolades with 
26 consecutive years of superior ratings, as well as having numerous 
students selected for All-District and All-State Bands. Many of his 
former students have become professional musicians who perform around 
the world.
  Asa shares his passion and expertise of music to colleagues across 
the district and State. Asa works on various different efforts, such as 
supervising new band directors, articulating with the Fernandina Beach 
High School band program, and serving on the Florida Bandmasters 
Association small schools and mentoring committees.

  Asa received his bachelor of music education from Troy University and 
was a member of the Sound of the South marching band. He currently is 
the band director at Fernandina Beach Middle School, where he has 
worked for a total of 17 years.
  I would like to recognize Asa for all his hard work and dedication to 
his students and look forward to hearing of his continued success in 
the years to come.
