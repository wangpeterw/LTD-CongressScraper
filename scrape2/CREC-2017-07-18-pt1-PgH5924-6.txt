                    WELCOMING REVEREND TERRY SANDERS

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
Shuster) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the great honor of 
welcoming Reverend Terry Sanders and his wife, Rhonda.
  Reverend Sanders traveled here from Uniontown, Pennsylvania, where he 
is the founder, CEO, and director of Genesis House Ministry, a ministry 
created to help men leaving the prison system move through a recovery 
process within a supportive environment, enabling them to transition 
back to society. His ministry has been helpful in battling the fight 
against the opioid crisis we face in America today.
  The Genesis House, at its core, is a resident house where clients 
receive far more than a warm bed. Rather than sending former inmates 
aimlessly into the streets, the ministry provides counseling, 
mentoring, job skill development, substance abuse programming, job 
placement services, and family integration assistance.
  Reverend Sanders has been working as the chaplain of the Fayette 
County Prison for more than 10 years and knows firsthand prison release 
qualifications and what it takes to make a difference in the lives of 
men.
  The ministry opened its doors in 2014 and is a result of Reverend 
Sanders' desire to make a difference in the community.
  I am grateful that Reverend Sanders is able to join us here today, 
and I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep and 
sincere appreciation for the great work he and his team are doing in 
western Pennsylvania.
