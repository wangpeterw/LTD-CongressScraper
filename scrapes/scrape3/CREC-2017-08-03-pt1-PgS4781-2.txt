                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever, we are 
transient creatures who long for a sense of permanence. Help us to find 
our permanence with a fixed and abiding faith in You.
  Lord, strengthen our lawmakers for the challenges of these times. 
Keep them in the shadow of Your wings, protecting them from seen and 
unseen dangers. Use Your powerful arm to guide, protect, and sustain 
our Nation. Hasten the day when people everywhere will seek and find 
You.
  Lord, let the tranquility of Your dominion increase in our Nation and 
world.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
