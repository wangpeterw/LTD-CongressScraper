   LOOK OUT WORLD; MICHELLE COLLINS IS DANCING AGAIN ON CENTER STAGE

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2008, at the home of Ricky 
and Victoria Collins, I met the most inspirational woman in Texas 
history: First Lady Laura Bush. Five years later, I learned there was 
one more woman who is more inspirational: Michelle Collins, the 
daughter of Ricky and Victoria.
  In 2013, Michelle learned that she had acute childhood leukemia. Her 
dreams of being a professional dancer were fading. She endured 2 years 
of brutal chemotherapy, 44 straight days in the hospital after her 
diagnosis, 18 spinal taps, and fever after fever with her depleted 
immune system.
  Michelle won her battle for life with family, faith, and art. As part 
of the children's art project at MDA Cancer Center, she designed 
Christmas ornaments that sold like ``hotcakes.''
  Recovered, she graduated last month from St. Agnes Academy in 
Houston, Texas. In 2 months, she will enroll at the University of Texas 
at Austin.
  Look out world, Michelle Collins is dancing again on center stage.
