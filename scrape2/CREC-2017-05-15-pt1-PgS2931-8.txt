                      TRIBUTE TO JACKSON VENTRELLA

 Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Jackson Ventrella for his 
hard work as an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize his 
efforts and contributions to my office as well as to the State of 
Wyoming.
  Jackson is a native of Mesa, AZ, and is a junior at Hillsdale 
College. He is studying politics. He has demonstrated a strong work 
ethic, which has made him an invaluable asset to our office. The 
quality of his work is reflected in his great efforts over the last 
several months.
  I want to thank Jackson for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
