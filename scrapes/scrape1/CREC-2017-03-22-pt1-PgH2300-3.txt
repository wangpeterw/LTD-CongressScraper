             UN-AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT TAKES US BACKWARD

  (Mr. HECK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, let's make this clear. The Un-American Health 
Care Act doesn't just repeal advances with ObamaCare, it takes us 
backward to a point worse off than we were before the Affordable Care 
Act.
  It guts Medicaid, and will fail to meet existing needs, hurting 
vulnerable children, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and 
seniors needing long-term care, hurting them all.
  It abandons Planned Parenthood services. Women with nowhere else to 
turn will lose access to critical services like pelvic exams and pap 
tests.
  I am here today speaking on behalf of single mom Sherry, cancer 
survivor Marty, star student Kelty, and little Gracie and her devoted 
grandmother Donna.
  We are all one voice saying we cannot afford to make the American 
healthcare system even worse than it was before ObamaCare. That is the 
path the un-American Health Care Act will carve. My friends, let's not 
go down that path. Vote ``no.''
