                 REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR. BILLY LEE

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life 
of Mr. Billy Lee, who passed away on December 21 at the age of 85.
  Mr. Lee owned McDonough's, the oldest Irish pub in Savannah; and the 
upstairs restaurant, Billy's Place. Mr. Lee and McDonough's are iconic 
in Savannah. McDonough's has been voted the best karaoke in town for 8 
straight years and is an immensely popular watering hole for all 
Savannahians.
  Mr. Lee never met a stranger in McDonough's and he had an extremely 
sharp memory for its patrons. His kindness is fondly remembered by all 
who frequented McDonough's, including times when he purchased blankets 
for the homeless, allowed folks to use his business for charity events, 
and opened his building for Hurricane Irma evacuees from Florida.
  Mr. Lee has commented on his restaurant and bar: That's the story of 
what we do here. We help people.
  Mr. Lee's kind spirit will be missed in Savannah, and I hope that 
people will continue to learn from his example for years to come.
