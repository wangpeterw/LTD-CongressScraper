                       TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS

  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Trump 
administration's decision to end temporary protected status, TPS, for 
more than 200,000 Salvadorans.
  TPS holders are thoroughly vetted legal residents who have 
contributed to our economy and to our communities for almost two 
decades. Most TPS recipients now call the United States home. Many are 
parents to children who are American citizens, and tearing these 
families apart is a heartless and cruel act.
  In their decision, this administration claims they reviewed the 
disaster-related conditions on which the original determination was 
made; however, they failed to consider the current realities that make 
El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world. This 
irresponsible decision will drop hundreds of thousands of people into 
violence and disaster.
  Sending 200,000 Salvadorans, many from my district, to a dangerous 
foreign country is inhumane. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
immediately pass the American Promise Act so that we can correct this 
despicable action.
