                       WELCOMING RABBI GARY KLEIN

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Bilirakis) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my great friend, 
Rabbi Gary Klein, who has led the Temple Ahavat Shalom of Palm Harbor, 
Florida, for the past 30 years.
  Temple Ahavat Shalom is a congregation that serves nearly 500 
households in my district. Since coming to Pinellas County in 1987, he 
served on the board of the St. Leo University Center for Catholic-
Jewish studies and currently serves on the National Council of AIPAC.
  Rabbi Klein is a long-time advocate on behalf of the U.S.-Israel 
alliance.
  As co-chair of the Congressional Hellenic Israeli Alliance, I welcome 
his continued advice and counsel, especially as it relates to security 
in the Eastern Mediterranean.
  For several years now, I have joined Rabbi Klein and the congregation 
for Passover Seder, and I very much look forward to continuing this 
tradition.
  I am thankful for his friendship, and I wish him many more years of 
blessed leadership.
