       SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT TAX BY HOLDING TAX TEACH

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise to set the record 
straight about the Trump-Republican tax scam recently signed into law.
  Middle-income and working people in Georgia would see a minimal gain, 
and eventually they will see their taxes go up, while the richest 1 
percent of Georgians will get an annual tax cut of $83,000.
  In fact, Georgia millionaires could receive a cut of more than 
$130,000 a year. In fact, the Trump-Republican tax cut bestows 83 
percent of the $5.5 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent who 
don't even need it, while blowing a $1.5 trillion hole in the Nation's 
debt.
  That is obscene, and that is why I am holding a tax teach this 
Saturday in my district to communicate with my constituents about what 
this tax scam means to them, what it means for their families, and what 
it means for jobs and economic growth.
