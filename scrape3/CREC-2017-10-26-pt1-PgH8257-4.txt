                 HONORING TROOPS ON DAY OF THE DEPLOYED

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the Day of 
the Deployed to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who are 
serving overseas.
  Today we salute them for their service on behalf of the United States 
of America. We also acknowledge the sacrifice of their families, who 
are separated from their loved ones during deployment.

  Mr. Speaker, serving one's country is a noble and selfless act. These 
men and women have answered the call of duty, and today we honor their 
dedication, service, and courage.
  In 2016, there were nearly 1.3 million Active Duty military 
personnel. Nearly 200,000 of those Active Duty members are deployed 
overseas. From Japan to Germany, and from South Korea to Afghanistan, 
our American men and women serve with distinction.
  In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, more than 50 airmen from the 
193rd Special Operations Wing are scheduled to return home this week 
following an overseas deployment in support of Operation Inherent 
Resolve.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like all of our deployed troops to know that we 
are proud of their efforts and are grateful for their service.
