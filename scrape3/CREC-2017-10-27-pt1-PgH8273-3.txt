                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peoples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, 
offered the following prayer:
  Our Father in Heaven, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to 
dwell in unity. It is like precious perfume upon the head, that ran 
down Aaron's beard, overflowing his garments, a sweet delight enjoyed 
by all.
  Anoint us liberally so we may walk and work together in loving 
kindness toward one another transforming those around us.
  With humble hearts may we receive from You instruction as from a 
caring father; that we attend to Your words to gain understanding and 
wisdom; that forsaking not Your law, we produce sound legislation for 
these, Your people.
  Father, as we honor and worship You, give us wisdom and insight. Have 
mercy upon us for we have sinned and fallen short of Your expectations. 
Like sheep, we have turned from the path of righteousness. There is 
none righteous, save only Your son, our savior.
  In his name, Jesus, we ask Your forgiveness.
  Amen.
