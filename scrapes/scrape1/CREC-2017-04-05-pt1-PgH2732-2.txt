          MOMENT OF SILENCE REMEMBERING VIRGINIA TECH VICTIMS

  (Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I am joined today by Members of the 
Virginia delegation and Members who were affected by the horrific 
attack by a gunman at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007. Today, we ask 
that all pause to remember the victims of this attack.
  Although 10 years have passed, those whose lives were tragically cut 
short or altered forever will not be forgotten. As we approach April 
16, I ask that we keep the families and loved ones of the victims in 
our thoughts and our prayers.
  May God bless the Hokie community, their courage, their spirit, and 
their determination to honor the memory of those not here today.
  Accordingly, I would ask that all Members join me at this time in a 
moment of silence.
