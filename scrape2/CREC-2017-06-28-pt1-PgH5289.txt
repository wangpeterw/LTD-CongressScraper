           SENATE BILL A MARCH BACK TO BAD OLD DAYS FOR WOMEN

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, some of my friends 
and colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to claim that, 
under the Senate's healthcare plan, women will be protected from 
discrimination. They won't be charged more for their healthcare than 
men. However, the facts show that nothing could be further from the 
truth.
  The Senate bill actually targets women for the cruelest cuts of all. 
It does so by allowing States to do away with guaranteed access to 
essential health services, now available under the Affordable Care Act. 
They are services like maternity care, no-cost birth control, and 
mammogram screening.
  But the Senate plan would allow States to completely waive any 
guarantee of service. States could, once again, allow insurers to 
consider preexisting conditions, like pregnancy, in setting fees and 
allow them to charge more. Plus, $800 billion in Medicaid cuts and 
defunding Planned Parenthood disproportionately harms women.
  Mr. Speaker, no matter how many times they say otherwise, they are 
marching back to the bad old days for women.
