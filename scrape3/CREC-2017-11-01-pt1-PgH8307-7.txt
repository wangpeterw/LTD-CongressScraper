                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)

[[Page H8308]]

  

  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, right now, President Trump and the 
Republicans are trying to pass a massive tax cut for billionaires, 
millionaires, and wealthy corporations, and reward companies that ship 
American jobs overseas. The only way they can pay for it is by raising 
taxes on working people and cutting more than $1 trillion from Medicare 
and Medicaid.
  This is not what Donald Trump, the candidate, promised the American 
people when he ran for President. He promised he would protect Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but it turns out that wasn't true.
  Wealthy Americans are doing better than ever. The top 1 percent are 
earning three times as much as they did 30 years ago, but working 
people haven't seen their pay go up at all.
  Let's get serious. Let's get working people a better deal that cuts 
their taxes. Let's get them a better deal that protects Social Security 
and Medicare. Let's not give tax breaks to companies that ship American 
jobs overseas.
  The American people deserve a better deal, not this raw deal that 
hurts working families.
