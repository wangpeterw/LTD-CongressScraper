                  WE MUST CONFRONT DOMESTIC TERRORISM

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, with the humblest of hearts, I cannot 
imagine the fear and the horror of those who heard those violent sounds 
late last night in Las Vegas, nor the horror of family members who had 
to wonder where their loved ones were or are now calling numbers to 
discern what happened.
  One of my closest relatives was in Las Vegas, and I can only imagine 
what they went through, as I had the great fear myself, not knowing 
where and what.
  I think the American people expect us to mourn and to honor them and 
to have a moment of silence, but I believe that the American people 
demand, and should, and those families who are now mourning, that we 
should be sensible.
  Mr. Speaker, we should not ever put on the floor of the House the 
deregulation of silencers. Can you imagine how many more would have 
died if the perpetrator who had ten guns had a silencer?
  We have to confront domestic terrorism. We can't run away from it. We 
have to confront automatic weapons no matter what, where, and how.
  My prayers are with the families, but I think they demand, Mr. 
Speaker, action from this Congress.
