                  RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JOHN HANCOCK

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, when you look at the heavens tonight, you may 
notice a new bright star. My fellow Texans from Sugar Land and Fort 
Bend County have seen that star for years. It is our John Hancock.
  John enjoyed life with us for 89 years. John is a native Texan, 
Houston proud, born on February 13 of 1928. He is a Korean Army 
veteran, 33 years with Mobil Oil, an investment adviser.
  John loved many things. He loved University of Texas football, Hook 
'em Horns. He loved his Astros, our baseball team. He loved his 
hometown of Sugar Land. He loved going to church

at Sugar Land First United Methodist Church. He loved to bowl. He 
bowled 297 points when he turned 80. But most of all, he loved his 
amazing wife, Linda.
  John and Linda are in Heaven together right now. Linda is there 
saying, ``Roll Tide,'' for her beloved Alabama Crimson Tide playing 
their football games. John is beside her saying, ``Beat LA,'' which is 
exactly what his beloved Astros will do in a few hours.
  Thank you, John. May the peace of Christ be with you and Linda 
forever.
