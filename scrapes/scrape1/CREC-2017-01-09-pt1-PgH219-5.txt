                        RECOGNIZING SANDRA MYERS

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Sandra Myers of 
Laurel Springs, North Carolina. This remarkable and talented woman is 
retiring after spending her entire 40-year career with the Social 
Security Administration.
  Since the age of 18, Sandra has worked in the Wilkesboro field office 
where she started in an entry-level position and currently serves as 
branch manager. My district staff and I have had the pleasure of 
working with her for many years now, and we have always found her to be 
a kind, caring person who is dedicated to serving others.
  Sandra and her husband, John, are nearly lifelong members of their 
church. Upon her retirement, she plans to continue to assist the 
community by helping elderly members at her church complete errands, 
remain active, and attend services.
  Sandra Myers is a perfect example of servant leadership, as well as 
the incredible work ethic that so many of my constituents in the Fifth 
District share. Alleghany County is fortunate to call this hardworking 
citizen one of its own.
