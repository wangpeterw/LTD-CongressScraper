                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2464

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2464) to improve border security and to provide 
     conditional provision residence to certain long-term 
     residents who entered the United States as children.

  Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
read for the second time on the next legislative day.

                          ____________________
