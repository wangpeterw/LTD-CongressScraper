                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, we lift our hearts to You. Lord, please shower Your 
mercy on our Nation, as we seek to deal with the Las Vegas mass 
shooting. Please show mercy to the victims and their families. Lord, in 
spite of this horrific act, give us faith to believe that evil will not 
ultimately prevail in our world. May this tragedy motivate us to plant 
and water seeds of peace as we cultivate a greater respect for the laws 
of seedtime and harvest. Cut in pieces the cords of wickedness that 
seek to bind us.
  Today, guide our Senators and use them as ambassadors of 
reconciliation in our Nation and world.
  Eternal God, although we walk in the midst of trouble, stretch forth 
Your hands and revive us with Your might.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
