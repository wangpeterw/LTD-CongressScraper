  Mr. HEINRICH submitted the following resolution; which was considered 
and agreed to:

                               S. Res. 67

       Whereas February 13, 2017, through February 19, 2017, is 
     recognized as ``National Health and Wellness Coach 
     Recognition Week'';
       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
     considers chronic diseases to be ``the public health 
     challenge of the 21st century'';
       Whereas decades of research have linked lifestyle factors, 
     such as inactivity, poor diet, tobacco smoking, and sustained 
     stress, with increased risk for major illnesses and death;
       Whereas the costs associated with treating many chronic 
     diseases are high and often preventable;
       Whereas a health and wellness coach is a new type of 
     healthcare worker who serves as a supportive mentor to 
     motivate individuals to make positive health choices and move 
     toward specific wellness goals;
       Whereas health and wellness coaches support clients in 
     achieving good health--
       (1) based on the goals of each client; and
       (2) in a manner consistent with the treatment plan 
     recommended by a healthcare provider for the client;
       Whereas health and wellness coaches assist clients in 
     making healthy lifestyle changes by encouraging them--
       (1) to use insight;
       (2) to use personal strengths and resources;
       (3) to set goals;
       (4) to create action steps; and
       (5) to hold themselves accountable;
       Whereas health and wellness coaches play a vital role in 
     improving individual wellness that complements, and does not 
     replace, the work of healthcare professionals; and
       Whereas an increasing number of studies demonstrate the 
     effectiveness of health and wellness coaches in--
       (1) improving individual health and wellness; and
       (2) reducing healthcare costs: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of the week of February 13, 
     2017, through February 19, 2017, as ``National Health and 
     Wellness Coach Recognition Week''; and
       (2) supports the efforts of the health and wellness coaches 
     of the United States in their important work to improve the 
     health and wellness of the people of United States.
