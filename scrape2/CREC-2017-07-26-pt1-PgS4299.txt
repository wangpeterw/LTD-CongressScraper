                      TRIBUTE TO ELLEN SCHLECHTER

 Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, today I recognize the 
distinguished accomplishment of a young South Dakotan, Ellen 
Schlechter, a 2017 recipient of the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses NFIB Young Entrepreneur Award. Ellen is a recent high school 
graduate from Orient, SD, and the founder and owner of The Calving Book 
App, a convenient and simple way to keep calf records on a user's 
smartphone, tablet, or computer.
  Growing up raising cattle, Ellen recognized a need in the 
agricultural sector for an application that would allow producers to 
document all of their cattle records in one place. Two years after the 
launch of The Calving Book App, Ellen has introduced an advanced 
version of the app and been featured in numerous ag publications and on 
local media in our State.
  I extend my congratulations to Ellen for being recognized by the NFIB 
for her accomplishments and entrepreneurial spirit, and I thank her for 
the work she has done to help our producers become more efficient. I 
wish her continued success in the years to come.

                          ____________________
