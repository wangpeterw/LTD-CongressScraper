                     IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL STUDIES

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, our public schools and public universities 
are essential for economic growth and educating future generations.
  But knowledge alone is not enough. Our Nation's future depends on 
innovative ideas, and innovative ideas require diverse people working 
together. In the public schools and public universities across the 
country, educators are helping foster diverse ideas through cultural 
studies.
  One such educator, Dr. Antoinette Ellis-Williams of New Jersey City 
University, has used poetry, film, scholarship, and service as a way to 
help young people explore issues that affect women and minorities. She 
has spent her career helping public university students understand the 
experiences of marginalized communities in the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend Dr. Ellis-Williams and cultural studies 
educators like her for helping future leaders develop the knowledge and 
wisdom to work together for a better future. She has been an asset to 
educating young people in the State of New Jersey for years, and I 
commend her.
