                          BORN-ALIVE ABORTIONS

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that it has been 30 
years since it was my first night alone as an OB/GYN resident at 
Bayfront Health in St. Petersburg, Florida. As fate would have it, I 
was called about 2 in the morning, stat, to the OB floor.
  When I got there, I went into a patient's room and reviewed a lady 
that I had never met before. I quickly looked at her and determined 
that she might be 24 weeks pregnant. But more alarmingly, she had blood 
oozing from the bed, soaking into the cloth beneath the

bed, filling buckets of blood, and I knew I had seconds or minutes to 
make a decision whether to do a C-section on this lady.
  As we rushed her back to the OR and quickly did a C-section, I was 
calling in neonatologists, anesthesiologists, anybody I could. And you 
can't imagine, when I reached in there to pull the first baby out, that 
there was a second baby. We did everything we could to save those 
babies' lives.
  But what I can't really believe, Mr. Speaker, is that an abortion 
clinic across town where botched abortions occur and babies born this 
same gestational age are executed in inhumane fashion.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a chance Friday to pass the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act, and I look forward to passing that 
legislation.
