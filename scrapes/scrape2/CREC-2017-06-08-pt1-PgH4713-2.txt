               WITHDRAWING FROM THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the safety and future 
of the American people is in jeopardy.
  Last week, the President made the irresponsible decision to withdraw 
the United States from the Paris climate accord. Military and national 
security leaders have asserted the need to address climate change as an 
imminent global threat. Removal from the Paris accord abdicates 
America's global leadership and increases the likelihood of climate 
disasters.
  However, where our President has failed, State and local leaders are 
stepping up and leading. For example, last week, California's Governor, 
Jerry Brown, brokered an agreement with China on reducing emissions. On 
the campaign trail, the President had a lot to say about China taking 
American jobs, but when he had the chance to pave the way to create 
American job growth, he failed.
  We must combat climate change and continue to deploy clean energy 
sources across the Nation that benefit our national security and create 
jobs.
