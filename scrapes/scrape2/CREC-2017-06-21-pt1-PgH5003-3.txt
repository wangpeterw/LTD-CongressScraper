                  HOW TRUMPCARE WILL AFFECT AMERICANS

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I worked in healthcare for a decade. I have 
seen up close how healthcare impacts families. That is why I began a 
short video series that we call ``Hear from the Heartland''. In this, I 
listen to families about how TrumpCare would affect them.
  I have spoken most recently with a woman named Anastasia. She has a 
little boy named Gryphon. They are from a town called Elizabeth, 
Illinois, just a small town.
  Gryphon was born with cerebral palsy, and because of TrumpCare, 
Gryphon's family might not have anywhere to turn for affordable 
coverage and would be at risk of reaching their lifetime limits on 
their insurance.
  Anastasia said it best when she said that her son's preexisting 
condition was simply being born.
  Whether it is at a grocery store or small business, I hear it: people 
talking about their grave concerns about TrumpCare and what it would do 
to them.
  I want us to work together on healthcare and make sure that we focus 
on lowering the costs for American families, but, instead, take a look 
at this. TrumpCare would raise costs, it would rip health insurance 
away from 23 million Americans, and it is so bad that, in the Senate, 
they are hiding their bill away. That is not what we were elected to 
do.
  I want to work with my colleagues to improve the healthcare that we 
deliver to American families.
