                    CBO ESTIMATE ON OBAMACARE REPEAL

  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to follow the 
distinguished minority leader, who is a gifted orator, a brilliant 
legislator, and an expert in something called disparate impact. 
Disparate impact is where you take two facts that are extraneous and 
put them together for an appearance of an irregularity or an 
impropriety without any fact being true.
  The statements made about the CBO estimate were accurate in what he 
said but wrong in the implication. He is accurate that CBO did say it 
would cost money if we didn't have a replacement for ObamaCare, which 
is the replacement being worked on as we speak right here today. Both 
are facts, but when put together the way he put them together, it makes 
it look as though we are spending money that we are not, in fact, 
spending at all.
  The CBO estimate also does not include the impact of legislative and 
administrative action to stabilize individual markets. In the absence 
of making that consideration, of course it is going to be more costly. 
Those are both extraneous facts that, when put together, make the 
appearance of a crime, which just isn't there.
