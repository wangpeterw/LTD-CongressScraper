                          CHIP REAUTHORIZATION

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to once again 
implore this Congress to take bipartisan action to extend Federal 
funding of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.
  In my home State of Pennsylvania, more than 176,000 children have 
gained access to affordable, comprehensive healthcare coverage through 
CHIP, providing them with age-appropriate medical and developmental 
care.
  Since the program became law, the percentage of uninsured children 
nationwide has decreased by more than half, from 13.9 percent in 1997 
to 6.6 percent in 2016.
  As a result of its reliability and effectiveness, CHIP has 
consistently enjoyed strong bipartisan support. In September, I joined 
a bipartisan group from across Pennsylvania in urging leaders of both 
parties to take action to ensure that children have access to high-
quality health insurance coverage during their formative years, a move 
we know yields an abundance of positive outcomes: fewer 
hospitalizations, increased earning power, and better healthcare 
outcomes as an adult.
  While this Chamber has already taken action, passing legislation last 
month to fund CHIP, the Senate has yet to act. It is crucial we provide 
certainty and security for children, parents, and providers and move to 
sign into law CHIP extension legislation as soon as possible.
  Mr. Speaker, the time is now for the Senate to act.
