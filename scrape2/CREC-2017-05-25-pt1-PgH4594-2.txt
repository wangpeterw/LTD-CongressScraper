                             VA SCHEDULING

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of the 
Veterans Administration Scheduling Accountability Act.
  All too often, I hear from veterans across the 22nd District of New 
York who have waited months, and some years, to have their claims 
addressed.
  In their service to our great Nation, our veterans sacrifice so much. 
They should never die waiting for care they deserve and need. That is 
why the House took important steps to reform the scheduling and appeals 
process while expanding access to the important resources that our 
veterans depend on. This bill will hold every VA accountable. We seek 
to correct a wrong that has hurt so many of our veterans.
  On behalf of the veterans in the 22nd District, I thank my colleague, 
Representative Jackie Walorski, and my colleagues in the House, for 
putting our Nation's heroes first and unanimously passing this 
important piece of legislation right before Memorial Day.
