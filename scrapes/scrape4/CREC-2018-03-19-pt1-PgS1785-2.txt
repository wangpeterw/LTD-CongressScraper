                            VOTE EXPLANATION

  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent due to a death 
in my family for rollcall votes Nos. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55. Had I 
been present I would have voted nay on all the rollcall votes in 
relation to S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and 
Consumer Protection Act. I would have also voted nay on the motion to 
invoke cloture on the nomination of Kevin McAleenan to be Commissioner 
of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, rollcall vote No. 55; PN1373.

                          ____________________
