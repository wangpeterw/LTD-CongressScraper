                      BRING DEPORTED VETERANS HOME

  (Mr. CASTRO of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank all those who 
have served our great Nation in the Armed Forces. On Veterans Day, we 
reflected on the sacrifices these brave men and women have made to keep 
us safe. Yet few Americans realize that U.S. citizenship is not 
required for military service, and even fewer know that our Nation has 
gone as far as deporting veterans.
  My colleagues and I in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus visited the 
Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana, Mexico, to learn more about 
this issue. We heard stories about their service, deportation, and 
separation from family members.
  Ivan Ocon was born in Mexico and came to the United States when he 
was 7 years old. He enlisted in the Army after high school, ``to serve 
the only country he knew to be his home.'' Ivan deployed to Iraq, 
Jordan, and Korea and received an honorable discharge. Ultimately, he 
was deported to Mexico and had to leave his family behind, including 
his U.S.-born daughter.
  Congress can and should pass legislation that brings these deported 
veterans home.
