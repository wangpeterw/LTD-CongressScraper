  EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY MR. FRELINGHUYSEN OF NEW JERSEY, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, REGARDING THE HOUSE 
             AMENDMENT TO THE SENATE AMENDMENTS ON H.R. 244

       The following is an explanation of the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2017.
                                 ______
                                 

   DIVISION H--DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND 
        EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       In implementing this agreement, the Departments and 
     agencies should be guided by the language and instructions 
     set forth in House Report 114-699 accompanying the House 
     bill, H.R. 5926, and Senate Report 114-274 accompanying the 
     Senate bill, S. 3040.
       Where the explanatory statement speaks to an issue that was 
     addressed in the House or Senate reports, the explanatory 
     statement should supersede the language in the House or 
     Senate reports. In cases where the House Report and the 
     Senate Report address a particular issue not specifically 
     cited in the explanatory statement, the House Report and the 
     Senate Report should be complied with and carry the same 
     emphasis as the language included in the explanatory 
     statement.
       Each department and agency funded in this Act shall follow 
     the directions set forth in this Act and the accompanying 
     statement, and shall not reallocate resources or reorganize 
     activities except as provided herein. Funds for individual 
     programs and activities are displayed in the detailed table 
     at the end of the explanatory statement for this division. 
     Funding levels that are not displayed in the detailed table 
     are identified within this explanatory statement. Any action 
     to eliminate or consolidate programs, projects, and 
     activities should be pursued through a proposal in the 
     President's Budget so it can be considered by the Committees 
     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the 
     Senate.
       Congressional Reports.--Each Department and agency is 
     directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate, within 30 days of 
     enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, a summary 
     describing each requested report to the Committees on 
     Appropriations along with its status.

                                TITLE I

                          DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

                 Employment and Training Administration

                    Training and Employment Services

       Reintegration of Ex-Offenders.--The agreement includes 
     $88,078,000 for ex-offender retraining and reintegration 
     activities, of which $25,000,000 is for competitive grants to 
     national and regional intermediaries. Efforts to build 
     partnerships with employers at the local level and to focus 
     training on in-demand skills are strongly supported. In lieu 
     of the report required by the House Report 114-699, the 
     Department of Labor (DOL) is directed to provide detailed 
     information in the fiscal year 2018 budget justification on 
     efforts undertaken to date as well as any new activities or 
     requirements that are intended to build effective industry 
     partnerships and job-placement services, offer industry-
     recognized credentials, and focus training on high-demand 
     occupations. Other than the reporting requirement, House and 
     Senate report language is not superseded.
       Apprenticeship Grants.--The agreement includes $95,000,000 
     to support Apprenticeship Grants, an increase of $5,000,000 
     above fiscal year 2016. The Department is directed to build 
     on the success of the ApprenticeshipUSA program and continue 
     funding innovative, job-driven approaches that expand 
     apprenticeship programs in high-growth and new industries. In 
     2015 women comprised nearly half of the national labor force, 
     but they made up less than ten percent of registered 
     apprentices. The Department is directed to prioritize grant 
     applications that engage, recruit, and serve women and other 
     under-represented populations.

                               Job Corps

       The agreement includes $1,704,155,000 for Job Corps, 
     including $32,330,000 for administration, $1,587,325,000 for 
     operations, and $84,500,000 for construction. The safety and 
     security of students, staff, and facilities remains a very 
     high priority. The Department is expected to use the 
     increases in funding as necessary to prioritize safety and 
     security improvements across the Job Corps system.

     State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations

       The agreement includes $115,000,000, the same amount as 
     fiscal year 2016, for the reemployment services and 
     eligibility assessment program. The amount reflects continued 
     strong support for a program that has been shown to reduce 
     improper payments and to provide intensive, individualized 
     intervention for unemployment compensation beneficiaries to 
     help return them fully and quickly to the workforce. The 
     agreement maintains Senate language clarifying flexibility 
     for local workforce agencies to target ex-service member 
     claimants, those most likely to exhaust benefits, as well as 
     claimants from a variety of backgrounds and lengths of time 
     receiving benefits as local officials deem necessary based on 
     local needs.
       The agreement includes $50,000,000 for the continued 
     support of State consortia to modernize their Unemployment 
     Insurance tax and benefit systems. The Department is expected 
     to apply the full $50,000,000 to this purpose, including 
     assistance to State consortia as needed to comply with 
     requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(10)(B).
       The agreement notes a provision in the preamble for the 
     Interim Final Rule (IFR) issued by the U.S. Citizenship and 
     Immigration Services and DOL in 2015 regarding H-2B mobile 
     housing policy. The IFR was issued without the public review 
     and comment period afforded in a typical rulemaking process, 
     in order to continue operation of the program. DOL is urged 
     to engage with all stakeholders to assess impacts of the 
     housing policy in industries requiring a mobile workforce.
       Unemployment Insurance (UI) Center of Excellence.--The 
     agreement includes $5,500,000 for the UI Center of Excellence 
     (Center), an increase of $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 
     2016 level. The increase of $2,500,000 is intended as a 
     payment on behalf of States to the entity operating the 
     Center.

                Office of Workers' Compensation Programs

       The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) has 
     established a Program Integrity unit and data analytics team 
     to identify and remedy areas of improper payments and fraud. 
     Despite these advancements, OWCP has been reticent to act 
     quickly in addressing reports of possibly improper and 
     fraudulent payments associated with compound drugs. 
     Therefore, OWCP shall issue a report within 120 days after 
     the date of enactment of this Act on its plan to strengthen 
     OWCP's role in evaluating these payments, including enhanced 
     utilization of program

[[Page H3950]]

     integrity measures in developing and implementing corrective 
     actions for the timely identification and remediation of 
     fraudulent and improper payments for programs it administers.

                 Mine Safety and Health Administration

       The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is 
     directed to provide assistance and data necessary for the 
     National Academy of Sciences study previously provided in the 
     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National 
     Institute of Occupational Safety and Health account. MSHA is 
     directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate and authorizing 
     committees of jurisdiction within 72 hours of determining 
     that compliance rates under the new sampling protocols taking 
     effect in 2016 fall below 95 percent, and to provide such 
     committees with quarterly reports on actual compliance rates 
     under the new coal dust rule.
       The agreement includes new language providing authority to 
     use State grants funds for the purchase and maintenance of 
     equipment required under the respirable coal dust standard. 
     The authority is intended to assist entities determined by 
     the Secretary to have demonstrated financial need to comply 
     with the new regulation. The authority is not intended to be 
     used for entities restructuring operations under bankruptcy 
     laws.


                            IT MODERNIZATION

       The agreement includes funding for the continuation of 
     information technology (IT) modernization efforts. The 
     Department is directed to take a risk-based approach to 
     allocating fiscal year 2017 development funds and prioritize 
     development projects that will result in more secure and 
     cost-effective IT systems. Within 180 days of enactment of 
     this Act, the Department is directed to submit a 
     comprehensive update on the status of all IT development 
     projects. This report should address both projects funded 
     through the IT Modernization account as well as development 
     projects being undertaken by individual agencies and offices. 
     The report should provide information for each project 
     including the name and type of project, current status 
     including total expenditures to date, projected timelines to 
     completion, expected improvements in agency processes, 
     customer service and performance, total expected cost of 
     development, expected annual cost of maintenance upon 
     completion, and anticipated annual savings and cost avoidance 
     from replacing or shutting down legacy systems.

                           General Provisions

       The agreement includes new transfer authority within the 
     Employment and Training Administration to conduct program 
     integrity activities.

                                TITLE II

                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

              Health Resources and Services Administration

     leaders in early childhood wellbeing, including State 
     officials in health and education, as well as medical

     campaign that informs clinicians, parents, and local 
     immunization programs about the severity and prevalence of 
     HPV-related cancers and the cancer prevention benefits of the 
     vaccine. The CDC is directed to provide an update in the 
     fiscal year 2018 budget justification on its strategy to 
     increase HPV vaccination rates.

     have been tested for the hepatitis C virus remains very low 
     and has not substantially increased, despite recommendations 
     from CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that all 
     members of this generation be tested at least once. CDC is

     health but not in other health conditions. It further found 
     that emerging evidence indicates that too much vitamin D may 
     be harmful. The agreement requests an update in the fiscal 
     year 2018 budget justification on the current state of the 
     science around vitamin D including what health benefits, if 
     any, vitamin D offers other than bone health. The agreement

     fiscal year 2018 budget justification.


         NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS)

       Science Education Partnership Awards (SEPA).--SEPA fosters 
     important connections between biomedical researchers and K-12 
     teachers and their students. These connections establish an 
     education pipeline to careers in biomedical sciences, which 
     is one of the most important areas of workforce development 
     in the U.S. economy. The agreement expects SEPA to receive 
     not less than $18,541,000, the fiscal year 2016 level, and 
     transfers SEPA funding to NIGMS following NIH's transfer of 
     the program earlier this year.


  NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD)

       Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMIs).--The 
     agreement continues to support the core mission of RCMIs to 
     develop new investigators from under-represented communities 
     and to conduct world-class biomedical research that 
     emphasizes minority health and health disparities. The 
     agreement expects the RCMIs to receive not less than 
     $58,461,000, which is the fiscal year 2016 level plus the 
     proportional share of the general increase provided to NIMHD.


      NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS)

       Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program.--
     The agreement includes additional funding for the CTSA 
     program to ensure that recommendations from the 2013 
     Institute of Medicine report can be implemented without 
     reducing the total number of CTSA awards. The agreement 
     directs NCATS to maintain the number of CTSA awards--
     including the number of clinical and

[[Page H3953]]

     translational research institutions--at no less than the 
     fiscal year 2016 level.


                         OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

       Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act.--The agreement 
     continues bill language for specific funds authorized by the 
     Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act within the Common 
     Fund to support the third year of the 10-year Pediatric 
     Research Initiative. The agreement requests an update in the 
     fiscal year 2018 budget justification on this effort as 
     described in the House and Senate reports.
       Clinical Center Reorganization.--The ongoing restructuring 
     of the NIH Clinical Center (CC) to ensure patient safety and 
     care after last year's highly critical Food and Drug 
     Administration (FDA) inspection of the CC Pharmacy remains a 
     high priority. NIH has started the reorganization laid out in 
     the Red Team's recommendations, including hiring a new CC 
     director and establishing a comprehensive oversight and 
     compliance office. These steps should greatly reduce risks, 
     increase assurance of participant safety, and improve 
     research quality. The agreement directs NIH to continue 
     providing timely updates on the reorganization to the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
     and the Senate, including an update in the fiscal year 2018 
     budget justification.
       Natural Products.--The agreement commends the FDA for 
     issuing draft guidance related to botanical drug products. 
     There are reports that many alternative and potentially life-
     saving products are already helping those for whom 
     traditional treatment is not enough or is ineffective. The 
     agreement encourages the NIH, including NCCIH and NCI, and 
     other Federal entities that fund cancer research, to speed 
     development and testing of natural products and their 
     derivatives, with the goal of accelerating the designation of 
     Investigational New Drug applications to promising products. 
     These drugs and their trials represent a promising complement 
     to cancer treatment and the agreement urges NIH to conduct 
     clinical trials in regions with disproportionally high cancer 
     burden and late stage presentation.

   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)

       The agreement continues bill language directing the 
     Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use to 
     exempt the Mental Health Block Grant and the Substance Abuse 
     Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant from being used 
     as a source for the PHS evaluation set-aside in fiscal year 
     2017, as was done prior to fiscal year 2012. Within the total 
     for SAMHSA, the agreement includes $20,000,000 to support 
     programs authorized in the Comprehensive Addiction and 
     Recovery Act of 2016, P.L. 114-198.

       Project AWARE.--Of the amount provided for Project AWARE, 
     the agreement directs SAMHSA to use $10,000,000 for 
     discretionary grants to support efforts in high-crime, high-
     poverty areas and, in particular, communities that are 
     seeking to address relevant impacts and root causes of civil 
     unrest. These grants should maintain the same focus as fiscal 
     year 2016 grants and continue to be coordinated with the 
     Department of Education grants.
       Project LAUNCH.--The agreement provides continuation 
     funding for all existing grant activities.
       National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.--The agreement 
     provides $11,000,000 for the National Strategy for Suicide 
     Prevention, an increase of $9,000,000 above the fiscal year 
     2016 level. Of this amount, $9,000,000 is for the Zero 
     Suicide initiative. The Zero Suicide initiative is a 
     comprehensive, multi-setting approach to suicide prevention 
     in health systems. The agreement also supports a set-aside 
     for American Indian/Alaska Native populations of $2,000,000 
     within the total for Zero Suicide.

       Medication-Assisted Treatment for Prescription Drug and 
     Opioid Addiction.--The agreement provides $56,000,000 for the 
     Medication-Assisted Treatment for Prescription Drug and 
     Opioid Addiction program. SAMHSA is directed to support 
     continuation grants and expand the program to additional 
     States. SAMHSA is directed to include as an allowable use 
     medication-assisted treatment and other clinically 
     appropriate services to achieve and maintain abstinence from 
     all opioids and heroin. SAMHSA is directed to give preference 
     in grant awards to treatment regimens that are less 
     susceptible to diversion for illicit purposes. These grants 
     should target States with the highest age adjusted rates of 
     admissions, including those that have demonstrated a dramatic 
     age adjusted increase in admissions for the treatment of 
     opioid use disorders.
       Criminal Justice Activities.--The agreement provides 
     $78,000,000 for Criminal Justice Activities and directs that 
     no less than $60,000,000 will be used exclusively for Drug 
     Court activities. SAMHSA is directed to ensure that all Drug 
     Treatment Court funding is allocated to serve people 
     diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their primary 
     condition. SAMHSA is further directed to ensure that all drug 
     treatment court grant recipients work directly with the 
     corresponding State substance abuse agency in the planning, 
     implementation, and evaluation of the grant. SAMHSA is 
     further directed to expand training and technical assistance 
     to drug treatment court grant recipients to ensure evidence-
     based practices are fully implemented.
       Pregnant and Postpartum Women.--The agreement includes an 
     increase of $4,000,000 for grants authorized under section 
     501 of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, 
     P.L. 114-198. Consistent with the authorization, the 
     additional funding will be used to fund pilot programs to 
     address treatment gaps for pregnant and postpartum women with 
     substance use disorders, including opioid use disorders.
       Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant-
     Overdose Fatality Prevention.--The agreement reflects strong 
     concerns about the increasing number of unintentional 
     overdose deaths attributable to prescription and 
     nonprescription opioids. SAMHSA is urged to take steps to 
     encourage and support the use of Substance Abuse and 
     Prevention Block Grant funds for opioid safety education and 
     training, including initiatives that improve access for 
     licensed healthcare professionals, including paramedics, to 
     emergency devices used to rapidly reverse the effects of 
     opioid overdoses. Such initiatives should incorporate robust 
     evidence based intervention training, and facilitate linkage 
     to treatment and recovery services.

       The agreement directs that all of the funding appropriated 
     explicitly for substance abuse prevention purposes both in 
     the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's PRNS lines as 
     well as the funding from the 20 percent prevention set-aside 
     in the SAPT Block Grant be used only for bona fide substance 
     abuse prevention programs and not for any other purpose.
       Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose.--The 
     agreement provides $12,000,000 for discretionary grants to 
     States to prevent opioid overdose-related deaths. This 
     program will help States equip and train first responders 
     with the use of devices that rapidly reverse the effects of 
     opioids. SAMHSA is directed to ensure applicants outline how 
     proposed activities in the grant would work

[[Page H3954]]

     with treatment and recovery communities in addition to first 
     responders.
       First Responder Training.--The agreement provides 
     $12,000,000 for First Responder Training grants as authorized 
     in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, P.L. 
     114-198. Of this amount, $6,000,000 is set aside for rural 
     communities with high rates of substance abuse. Consistent 
     with the authorization, SAMHSA is directed to ensure 
     applicants outline how proposed activities in the grant would 
     work with treatment and recovery communities in addition to 
     first responders.

               Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services


                           PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

       Air Ambulance Services and Payment Structures.--In lieu of 
     the language in Senate Report 114-274, the agreement directs 
     the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report 
     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate on fixed wing and helicopter 
     air ambulance services, operational costs, and, as available, 
     payment structures no later than 18 months after the 
     enactment of this Act. The report should include an analysis 
     of costs, including all operational, mechanical, medical, 
     human capital, and business expenses. The report shall 
     include analysis of the number of providers providing either 
     fixed wing or rotor wing ambulance services and the number of 
     transports, taking into consideration the volume of 
     transports per provider over time, and the number in 
     comparative volumes for accident site, inter-facility, and 
     non-emergency/charter transports. The report should reflect 
     demographic and urban/rural/super rural differences as well 
     as differences in fixed wing and helicopter services. GAO may 
     examine the source and amount of reimbursement for these 
     services among private insurance companies, Medicare, 
     Medicaid reimbursement rates, and other Federal government 
     sponsored reimbursement rates such as TRICARE. The agreement 
     understands that the GAO already has an ongoing effort in 
     regards to the requested report on Air Ambulance Services and 
     Payment issues. To prevent duplication of effort, GAO should 
     include this information within the ongoing effort to the 
     extent practicable. GAO shall consult with the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     as it develops the methodology and scope for the review.
       Critical Access Hospitals.--The agreement continues to note 
     concerns about the proposal to eliminate Critical Access 
     Hospitals (CAH) status from facilities located less than 10 
     miles from another hospital and reducing the reimbursement 
     rate from 101 to 100 percent on the hospitals to properly 
     provide care to local residents. The agreement directs the 
     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to take steps 
     to limit the negative impact of the proposed rate reduction 
     on CAH.
       Health Insurance Exchange Transparency.--The agreement 
     continues to include bill language in section 221 that 
     requires CMS to provide cost information for the following 
     categories: Federal Payroll and Other Administrative Costs; 
     Exchange-related Information Technology (IT); Non-IT Program 
     Costs, including Health Plan Benefit and Rate Review, 
     Exchange Oversight, Payment and Financial Management, 
     Eligibility and Enrollment; Consumer Information and 
     Outreach, including the Call Center, Navigator Grants and 
     Consumer Education and Outreach; Exchange Quality Review; 
     Small Business Health Options Program and Employer 
     Activities; and Other Exchange Activities. Cost information 
     should be provided for each fiscal year since the enactment 
     of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
     111-148). CMS is also required to include the estimated costs 
     for fiscal year 2018.
       Meaningful Use.--The agreement notes that some eligible 
     hospitals met the substantive requirements for the Medicare 
     Electronic Health Records Incentive Program, but failed to be 
     certified due to administrative error. As a result, the 
     eligible hospitals did not receive an incentive payment or 
     were subject to a payment adjustment. The agreement directs 
     CMS to reconsider options to provide an appeal to such 
     eligible hospitals that met substantive program requirements.
       Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP).--The agreement 
     supports CMS' expansion of the Medicare Diabetes Prevention 
     Program beginning in January 2018 to improve health outcomes 
     and reduce diabetes-related healthcare costs. The agreement 
     encourages CMS to include virtual and remote technologies, in 
     addition to in-person services, as allowable means for 
     providing MDPP services to beneficiaries in future 
     rulemaking.
       Risk Corridor Program.--The agreement continues bill 
     language to prevent the CMS Program Management appropriation 
     account from being used to support risk corridor payments. 
     The agreement directs CMS to provide a report starting with 
     plan year 2014 and continuing through the duration of the 
     program to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate detailing the receipts and 
     transfer of payments for the Risk Corridor Program.
       Severe Wounds.--The agreement notes CMS' prompt 
     implementation of section 231 of the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2016 and directs CMS to implement this 
     provision with an effective date of December 18, 2015.

                Administration for Children and Families


                     REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE

       Victims of Trafficking.--The agreement includes $13,000,000 
     for services for foreign national victims, and $5,755,000 to 
     improve services available for U.S. citizens and legal 
     permanent residents.


                CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS

       Child Abuse Discretionary Activities.--The agreement 
     includes funding to preserve, disseminate, and amplify the 
     work of the Quality Improvement Center (QIC) for Research-
     based Infant-Toddler Court Teams by providing training and 
     technical assistance in support of such court teams' efforts 
     across the country. These efforts shall build upon and 
     continue the work of sites established through the QIC 
     initiative, which have brought together the court system, 
     child welfare agencies, health professionals, and community 
     leaders to improve current practices in the child welfare 
     system and make better-informed decisions on behalf of the 
     child. The agreement strongly encourages the Administration 
     for Children and Families to allocate the funds promptly.

     American Programs Act.
       Preschool Development Grants.--Consistent with the 
     authorization of the Preschool Development Grant program in 
     the Every Student Succeeds Act, the agreement requests a 
     report describing the transition of authority and program 
     operations from the Department of Education to the Department 
     of Health and Human Services. The report shall include a 
     specific and clear outline of how HHS will administer the 
     program, including an outline for the transition process that 
     will occur as the Departments shift the program from 
     Education to HHS. The report shall be provided to the 
     Committees on Appropriations and Education and the Workforce 
     in the House of Representatives and the Committees on 
     Appropriations and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in 
     the Senate.

     recommendations with the goal of reducing the number of 
     children living in poverty in the United States by half in 10 
     years. The funds are provided to extend the original 
     agreement with the National Academy of Sciences.

     grant programs administered by the Administration For 
     Community Living (ACL) to pay for administrative costs at ACL 
     including additional staff or any other administrative or 
     emergency expenses. The agreement expects ACL will maintain 
     this commitment for fiscal year 2017 and further believes 
     that in future budget years ACL should meet its 
     administrative needs through targeted funding for its 
     administrative accounts, not by shifting funds from grant 
     programs.
       Aging Network Support Activities.--The agreement provides 
     $9,961,000 for Aging Network Support Activities, of which

     for the Independent Living program, of which $22,878,000 is

     the capacity to seek information by sex and by race/ethnicity 
     simultaneously, at the State and county levels.

       The agreement includes $80,000,000 for the HHS Office of

                               TITLE III

                        DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

                    Education For The Disadvantaged

       National Activities.--There is significant concern about 
     the Department's allocation of resources available through 
     various national activities authorities for pay for success 
     projects. While pay for success and other innovative 
     financing mechanisms may prove to be a worthy investment, 
     these projects were explicitly authorized under the Every 
     Student Succeeds Act only in three instances. However, the 
     Department chose to use fiscal year 2016 national activities 
     resources for these projects in programs where Congress did 
     not authorize such a use of funds and did so without any 
     consultation with the committees of jurisdiction. Therefore, 
     the Department is directed to submit to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the 
     Senate, Committee on Education and the Workforce in the House 
     of Representatives, and Committee on Health, Education, 
     Labor, and Pensions in the Senate operating plans describing 
     in detail its planned use of funds for national activities 
     program authorities funded in this title not later than 45 
     days prior to the announcement of the availability of funding 
     for such activities.

                      School Improvement Programs

       The agreement allows Student Support and Academic 
     Enrichment grants funding provided in this Act to be 
     distributed within a State on a competitive basis at a 
     State's discretion.

                            Indian Education

       Native Youth Community Projects.--Within the total for 
     Special Programs for Indian Children, the agreement includes 
     $43,452,000 for Native Youth Community Projects. This program 
     makes competitive awards to support culturally-relevant 
     coordinated strategies to improve the college- and career-
     readiness of Native American youth.
       State-Tribal Education Partnership.--The agreement includes 
     continued funding for the State-Tribal Education Partnership 
     (STEP) Program, which makes grants to tribes to build 
     capacity to assume certain State responsibilities for the 
     administration of ESEA programs.
       National Activities.--Within the total for National 
     Activities, the agreement includes funding for a new language 
     immersion program to maintain and promote the use of Native 
     languages. These funds should be allocated to support 
     extensive distribution across geography and language 
     diversity and support both existing and new Native language 
     immersion programs and schools.

                       Innovation and Improvement

       Supporting Effective Educator Development.--The agreement 
     includes funding for competitive grants, which may include a 
     consortia of programs operating in multiple States, to 
     improve the academic preparation and college readiness, 
     including the college-and-career pipeline, of rural youth. 
     Such programs should support teachers in all grade levels and 
     across disciplines, students, families, and community 
     members, in high-need rural areas. Specific activities could 
     include professional development and on-site programming for 
     teachers and school administrators throughout the year; youth 
     writing and literacy programs; and community-based workshops 
     for students and families.
       Ready to Learn.--The agreement provides for additional 
     funding to help Ready to Learn grantees meet their project 
     objectives and successfully produce the high-quality 
     educational programming intended by Congress. The Department 
     shall provide each grantee a proportional share of such funds 
     based on grantees' initial budget submissions. There remains 
     concern with the Department's poor management in 
     administering this program; accordingly, the Department is 
     advised to improve future communications with both grantees 
     and the Congress.

                 Safe Schools and Citizenship Education

       Promise Neighborhoods.--The agreement includes bill 
     language extending authority provided under the Promise 
     Neighborhoods program in the Every Student Succeeds Act to 
     grants made under the previous authorization of the program. 
     The Department is directed to use that authority to extend 
     funding for current high-quality Promise Neighborhoods 
     programs operating in underserved areas that have 
     demonstrated promising results through their initial 
     implementation grant and propose to continue pursuing 
     ambitious goals through continued innovative

[[Page H3956]]

     activities during such extension of their award.

                           Special Education

       Within Technical Assistance and Dissemination, the 
     agreement includes $12,583,000 for education activities 
     authorized under P.L. 108-406, as amended.
       Education Technology, Media, and Materials Program.--
     Progress has been made with tools and services provided under 
     the Education Technology, Media and Materials program that 
     have allowed more than 380,000 students free access to more 
     than 325,000 books in multiple digitally accessible formats. 
     The agreement directs the Department to include not less than 
     the fiscal year 2016 level of funding to expand this 
     program's reach to K-12 students in underserved areas.

           Special Institutions For Persons With Disabilities

       American Printing House for the Blind.--The agreement 
     continues to recognize the significant progress being made 
     through the Resources with Enhanced Accessibility for 
     Learning (REAL) Plan toward developing new technologies to 
     translate educational materials for delivery to students who 
     are blind and visually impaired. These technological advances 
     will provide educational materials to students more quickly 
     than ever before, enhancing opportunities for academic 
     achievement. The agreement continues to support 
     implementation of the REAL plan, and includes not less than 
     $475,000 for such activities, the same as the fiscal year 
     2016 level.
       National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID).--The 
     agreement includes $2,000,000 in continued funding to support 
     NTID's operational costs and to continue support for at least 
     one regional partnership via a subcontract with an external 
     organization consistent with its mission and strategic plan. 
     These partnerships enable NTID to expand the geographic reach 
     of services and activities supported by the college for 
     individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing. The partnership 
     activities include a focus on: promoting training and 
     postsecondary participation in Science, Technology, 
     Engineering, and Math fields; working with NTID faculty to 
     develop postsecondary preparation for students; providing 
     professional development for teachers and developing 
     partnerships with business and industry to promote employment 
     opportunities for individuals who are deaf and hard of 
     hearing.

                      Student Financial Assistance

       Pell Grants.--The agreement includes a provision as 
     included in the Senate bill regarding year-round Pell grants. 
     The Department should implement this provision to maximize 
     flexibility for institutions of higher education and avoid 
     unnecessary administrative burdens while ensuring the best 
     interests of students. The Department is directed to issue 
     guidance on this expanded eligibility and flexibility in the 
     Pell grant program not later than July 1, 2017. The 
     Department is also directed to provide reliable data on the 
     implementation of this provision.

                       Student Aid Administration

       Student Loan Servicing.--The agreement directs the 
     Department to permit borrowers who are consolidating their 
     student loans to choose from among all Federal student loan 
     servicers when choosing a servicer for their new consolidated 
     loans. The Department is expected to make common performance 
     metrics available to borrowers to help guide their decision 
     for which servicer to select. This will allow student 
     borrowers to stay with their existing servicer if they wish 
     to, limit unnecessary disruption for borrowers, and provide 
     another incentive for servicers to provide high-quality 
     service to borrowers. The Department is directed to brief the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
     and the Senate and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, 
     Labor, and Pensions and House Committee on Education and the 
     Workforce within 30 days of enactment of this Act on how it 
     plans to carry out this directive.

                            Higher Education

       TRIO.--The agreement does not include funding for the TRIO 
     demonstration project proposed in the budget justification.
       The Department is directed to allocate fiscal year 2017 
     TRIO funding such that all current grantees receive an 
     increase in their grant award. The Department is directed to 
     avoid imposing additional requirements as a condition for 
     grantees to receive these funds. Additionally, the Department 
     is directed to increase the number of new grants awarded for 
     those programs that will conduct a new competition this 
     fiscal year.
       There is concern that the Department has rejected and made 
     ineligible for review several fiscal year 2017 grant 
     applications based on minor formatting issues. The Department 
     is strongly encouraged to provide flexibility to such 
     applicants by permitting submission of a corrected 
     application. The Department should include consistent 
     formatting requirements across all TRIO competitions in the 
     future.

                    Institute of Education Sciences

       The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shall 
     explore ways to collect aggregate teacher-level data on 
     student characteristics when it administers the National 
     Teacher and Principal Survey so that in the future NCES is 
     able to provide better data about the characteristics of 
     students taught by teachers with different certifications.

                           General Provisions

       The agreement includes a new general provision expanding 
     eligibility and flexibility in the Pell grant program 
     relating to year-round Pell grants.
       The agreement includes a new general provision rescinding 
     unobligated balances available for the Pell grant program.

     (CNCS) to issue clear, extensive guidance as part of their 
     fiscal year 2018 request for proposals for AmeriCorps grants 
     outlining specifically how grantees can demonstrate and 
     justify the need for operating funds as part of their 
     professional corps grant.
       Training and Technical Assistance.--Under current law, CNCS 
     has authority to set aside up to 25 percent of program funds 
     for evaluation, training, and technical assistance. CNCS is 
     directed to use this authority to provide not less than 
     $7,500,000 for training and technical assistance activities 
     for State Commissions, to expand the capacity of current and 
     potential AmeriCorps programs, particularly in underserved 
     areas.
       Innovation, Demonstration, and Assistance Activities.--The 
     agreement does not include funding for the Social Innovation 
     Fund.

                     Social Security Administration


                 LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

       Administrative Law Judge Hiring.--The Social Security 
     Administration's National Hearing Centers (NHCs) provide the 
     Social Security Administration (SSA) with invaluable 
     flexibility and support to address the hearings backlog. 
     Understanding the value of this flexibility and support, the 
     agreement directs SSA to ensure that its upcoming 
     Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hiring allocates additional 
     ALJs to NHCs.
       Disability Case Processing System.--The agreement strongly 
     supports the recommendation by the Office of Inspector 
     General that SSA should periodically evaluate its path 
     forward to ensure it is pursuing the most cost-effective 
     alternative to achieve the goals of a modernized case-
     processing system for SSA and obtain the greatest value for 
     the taxpayer. To that end, the agreement supports SSA's 
     decision to obtain an independent, third-party evaluation of 
     the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing various 
     alternatives from this point forward, including continued 
     deployment of DCPS2, and other options. The Social Security 
     Administration is directed to brief the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     on the results of the evaluation within 90 days of enactment 
     of this Act.
       Prioritizing Continuing Disability Reviews To Maximize Cost 
     Savings.--A recent Government Accountability Office report 
     (GAO-16-250) found that SSA's Continuing Disability Review 
     (CDR) prioritization models fail to maximize potential cost 
     savings. Within 1 year, and every 3 years thereafter, the 
     agreement directs SSA to review and update the models for 
     prioritization of CDRs with the primary intent of efficiently 
     and effectively maximizing lifetime cost savings to the 
     government. A detailed, cost-based explanation

[[Page H3957]]

     for the model's prioritization of different CDR types and 
     justification for any updates made should be included in the 
     annual CDR Report.
       Program Integrity.--The agreement supports increased 
     funding for program integrity activities within SSA. The 
     intent of this agreement is for SSA to support program 
     integrity activities solely from funds available for that 
     purpose. The agreement provides an additional six months of 
     availability to use program integrity funds to facilitate 
     reconciliation of actual costs at the end of the fiscal year.
       Reducing the Disability Adjudication Backlog.--The 
     agreement includes funds to address SSA's disability 
     adjudication backlog, which is currently 560 days on average. 
     The Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate are disappointed in SSA's 
     progress in reducing the backlog when specific funding was 
     provided in the Further Continuing and Security Assistance 
     Appropriations Act, 2017. Due to concerns about continued 
     weaknesses with SSA's CARES plan, SSA is directed to submit a 
     detailed report to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate, the Committee on 
     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate within 90 days of 
     enactment of this Act that outlines its plan for reducing the 
     disability backlog of the Office of Disability Adjudication 
     and Review (ODAR) and increasing ODAR's effectiveness. The 
     report shall include measurable milestones toward achieving 
     key elements of SSA's hiring and improved automation goals. 
     These milestones shall include workload information, 
     including receipts, pending, and processing time, award rate, 
     and decisions rate at each level of adjudication, workforce 
     information for ALJs, Decision Writers, and other support 
     staff including new hires, separations, and support staff 
     ratios, planned obligations by quarter for each component of 
     the initiative, as well as the expected reductions in the 
     backlog. To ensure this effort stays on schedule, SSA is 
     directed to submit quarterly reports to such Committees that 
     compare actual data with milestones identified in the initial 
     report. The quarterly reports should compare actual and 
     planned data on obligations, hiring, effects on the backlog, 
     and other performance measures.
       Representative Payee.--The agreement notes that any vendor 
     hired to conduct representative payee monitoring reviews have 
     significant and demonstrable experience monitoring 
     representative payees, and addressing problems found among 
     individuals with different types of disabilities and among 
     different types of service providers. SSA should expect close 
     Congressional oversight of this situation throughout the 
     coming year. The agreement also notes with concern a lack of 
     oversight and internal controls in the Representative Payee 
     program. SSA is encouraged to improve program monitoring to 
     address program deficiencies discussed in recent Office of 
     the Inspector General reports.
       Work Incentives Planning and Assistance and Protection and 
     Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security.--The agreement 
     includes $23,000,000 for Work Incentives Planning and 
     Assistance and $7,000,000 for Protection and Advocacy for 
     Beneficiaries of Social Security.

                                TITLE V

                           General Provisions

       The agreement includes language rescinding various 
     unobligated balances.
       The agreement includes an extension of the Special Olympics 
     Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004.

        DIVISION I--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       The following is an explanation of the effects of Division 
     I, which makes appropriations for the Legislative Branch for 
     fiscal year 2017. Unless otherwise noted, reference to the 
     House and Senate reports are to House Report 114-594 and 
     Senate Report 114-258. The language included in these reports 
     should be complied with and carry the same emphasis as the 
     language included in the explanatory statement, unless 
     specifically addressed to the contrary in this explanatory 
     statement. While repeating some report language for emphasis, 
     this explanatory statement does not intend to negate the 
     language referred to above unless expressly provided herein.
       Reprogramming Guidelines: It is expected that all agencies 
     notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and the 
     Senate of any significant departures from budget plans 
     presented to the Committees in any agency's budget 
     justifications. In particular, agencies funded through this 
     bill are required to notify the Committees prior to each 
     reprogramming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10 percent 
     or $750,000 between programs, projects or activities, or in 
     excess of $750,000 between object classifications (except for 
     shifts within the pay categories, object class 11, 12, and 13 
     or as further specified in each agency's respective section). 
     This includes cumulative reprogrammings that together total 
     at least $750,000 from or to a particular program, activity, 
     or object classification as well as reprogramming FTEs or 
     funds to create new organizational entities within the Agency 
     or to restructure entities which already exist. The 
     Committees desire to be notified of reprogramming actions 
     which involve less than the above-mentioned amounts if such 
     actions would have the effect of changing an agency's funding 
     requirements in future years or if programs or projects 
     specifically cited in the Committee's reports are affected.
       Cybersecurity: In lieu of Senate report language pertaining 
     to cybersecurity, the universe of information technology (IT) 
     is an ever evolving, fast paced environment in which the 
     Federal Government operates. As such, this bill provides 
     funding for additional technology infrastructure and security 
     enhancements.
       There is concern, however, that a lack of standard 
     operating procedures and known best practices related to 
     technological investments, especially in the area of 
     cybersecurity, may lead to wasteful spending by the 
     government. To that point, agencies involved in the 
     Legislative Branch Cybersecurity Working Group (LBCWG) shall 
     work to improve the overall cyber security posture of the 
     Legislative Branch and are directed to complete an assessment 
     of IT resiliency as developed by the LBCWG within 90 days of 
     enactment of this act. These assessments will be provided to 
     the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, and 
     to each agency's authorizing oversight committee in both the 
     House and Senate.
       Additionally, this report directs the Library of Congress 
     to conduct a study with a federally funded research and 
     development corporation to assess the requirements and 
     constraints in implementing multi-factor authentication for 
     Legislative Branch agencies. This study will be provided to 
     the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, 
     Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the 
     Committee on House Administration. This study must be 
     completed prior to the Library executing on its multi-factor 
     authentication request.

                                TITLE I

                                 SENATE

       The agreement includes $871,176,081 for Senate operations. 
     This item relates solely to the Senate, and is in accordance 
     with long practice under which each body determines its own 
     housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without 
     intervention.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

       The agreement provides for unspent amounts remaining in 
     Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account to be 
     used for deficit or debt reduction and authority for transfer 
     of funds.

                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

       The agreement includes $1,189,050,766 for House operations. 
     This item relates solely to the House, and is in accordance 
     with long practice under which each body determines its own 
     housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without 
     intervention.
       Ford House Office Building Data Center Space: It is 
     directed that any renovation plans for the data center space 
     located in the Ford House Office Building commence no earlier 
     than March 31, 2018 if those plans will impact data center 
     operations of other Legislative Branch agencies. 
     Accommodation should be given to affected agencies' funding 
     and information technology needs in finalizing such plans.
       House Food Service: There is concern with continued food 
     service issues surrounding lack of food variety, consistent 
     quality of service, and management challenges with the food 
     services provider. It is known that additional cafeteria 
     renovations and reconfigurations are needed in the near 
     future; prior to moving forward with any significant 
     renovations the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) in 
     conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol should explore 
     the feasibility of making available additional branded 
     options to the House community. The findings should be 
     reported to the House Committee on Appropriations and the 
     Committee on House Administration. Additionally, we are 
     supportive of the CAO's recently developed food service 
     quality assurance program. The CAO is encouraged to work with 
     oversight committees to make recommendations on ways to 
     improve food service based on the findings of the program.
       Cybersecurity Assistance: Cybersecurity is quickly emerging 
     as one of the most important aspects of the House of 
     Representatives' security platform. Evolving threats and 
     actors demand the House of Representatives, and the 
     organizations under its jurisdiction, stay one step ahead. To 
     that end, the House of Representatives' response capabilities 
     may, in significant circumstances, dictate the need for 
     additional support and assistance from the executive branch.
       It is realized that the nature of the support and 
     assistance provided by the executive branch is contingent on 
     the threats and vulnerabilities experienced by the House of 
     Representatives. It is intended that the Speaker, in 
     consultation with the Minority Leader, outline the type of 
     infrequent executive branch assistance that may be required, 
     including resources provided by the House of Representatives, 
     resources provided by the executive branch, actions and 
     constraints on those resources necessary to protect the 
     Separation of Powers, privileges under the Speech or Debate 
     Clause of the Constitution, and other constitutionally-
     derived powers and rules including those enacted pursuant to 
     the Rulemaking Clause of the Constitution.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

       The agreement provides for unspent amounts remaining in 
     Members' Representational Allowances account to be used for 
     deficit or debt reduction; prohibits the delivery of bills 
     and resolutions; prohibits the delivery of printed copies of 
     the Congressional Record; places a limitation on amount 
     available to lease vehicles; places a limitation on print 
     copies of the U.S. Code; prohibits delivery of reports of 
     disbursements, daily calendars, and printed copies of the 
     Congressional Pictorial Directory; allows USCP dignitary 
     protection detail to travel overseas with Members of the 
     Leadership; prohibits delivery of telephone directories, 
     Budget of the United States Government and Federal Register; 
     and cybersecurity assistance.

       The agreement includes $325,300,000 for salaries of the 
     Capitol Police. An obligation plan is no longer needed as 
     required in House Report 114-594.
       The increase includes full year funding for 24 hires added 
     in FY2016 and half year costs of 72 hires expected to address 
     implementation of additional screening and pre-screening at 
     various building access points. The total staffing level is 
     expected to be approximately 1,871 sworn and 372 civilian 
     staff. No more than $36,805,000 is recommended for overtime 
     in fiscal year 2017, which includes funds to support the 
     staffing of the Thomas P. O'Neill Federal Office Building. 
     This provides for approximately 587,000 hours of additional 
     duty.
       The agreement does not include funds for USCP overtime for 
     requirements associated with the restoration of the Cannon 
     House Renewal Project, or any other major construction 
     projects undertaken by the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) as 
     those funds are provided to the AOC as part of the overall 
     project costs for those major projects and are paid to the 
     USCP on a reimbursable basis. It is expected the USCP to 
     operate within the designated funding level for requirements 
     associated with each project.

                            General Expenses

       The agreement includes $68,000,000 for general expenses of 
     the Capitol Police.

                        Administrative Provision

       The agreement provides for disposal of lost and found 
     property and acceptance of property from other Federal 
     agencies.

                        ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL

       The agreement includes $617,887,000 for the activities of 
     the Architect of the Capitol (AOC).
       Construction Division: The Committees are aware of AOC's 
     practice of employing its Construction Division employees as 
     short-term, annual employees who do not have identical job 
     protections and benefits available to permanent full-time 
     employees.

[[Page H4032]]

       Therefore, the AOC is directed to submit a report detailing 
     the structure and operations of the Construction Division 
     within 90 days of enactment. The report should include 
     details on how the Construction Division's capabilities are 
     integrated into AOC's project planning processes, how job 
     security protections and other benefits are comparable to 
     those extended to other AOC staff, how employment status 
     affects workforce retention, AOC's dependence on outside 
     contractors, and whether or not the Construction Division is 
     still meeting the goals and purpose of its original creation.
       Senate Restaurants: Concerns continue, as detailed in 
     Senate Report 114-258, regarding findings that the food 
     service provider for the Senate underpaid many of its 
     employees by misclassifying their work duties, and that 
     problems with contract compliance could continue. It is 
     emphasized that the AOC shall follow all directives included 
     in such report, particularly the directive for the AOC to 
     consider all recourses in ensuring compliance and 
     accountability with the contract. AOC is further directed to 
     continue to consider all such recourses throughout the entire 
     term of the contract if additional contract compliance 
     problems arise. It is noted that the Government 
     Accountability Office is conducting an audit of AOC's 
     oversight of the Senate restaurant contract and that the AOC 
     Inspector General has taken steps to incorporate AOC's 
     restaurant contract management into its routine oversight.
       It is noted that the Architect has committed, including in 
     written correspondence to and meetings with Members of the 
     United State Senate, to fully institute comprehensive reforms 
     of the AOC's oversight of Senate restaurant contracts. 
     Reforms include, but are not limited to: increasing the 
     number of dedicated AOC staff to the oversight of restaurant 
     contracts and ensuring such staff maintain a close and 
     continuing connection to the Senate community; coordinating 
     detailed, ongoing audits of employee wage rates and wage 
     classifications; determining if areas of improvement to the 
     contractor's pay administration practices exist so that 
     information is readily available and transparent to contract 
     employees; facilitating training on applicable labor laws for 
     both AOC staff and relevant contract staff; ensuring the 
     contractor maintains a full-time, dedicated human resources 
     manager on site; and ensuring specific improvements in 
     contractor communications with its employees, including for 
     communications to be available in multiple languages, as 
     needed, and ensuring contractor employees have convenient 
     access to report possible violations. It is expected that the 
     reforms AOC has committed to will be fully instituted and 
     formalized as standard operating procedures as soon as 
     practicable. The AOC is directed to continue to immediately 
     report all developments related to contractor oversight of 
     Senate restaurants to both to the Senate Committee on 
     Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Rules and 
     Administration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Use of Grounds: It is understood the need to maintain 
     safety and order on the Capitol grounds and the Capitol 
     Police are commended for their efforts. Given the family-
     style neighborhood that the Capitol shares with the 
     surrounding community it is expected the Capitol Police 
     continue to forebear enforcement of 2 U.S.C. 1963 (``An act 
     to protect the public property, turf, and grass of the 
     Capitol Grounds from injury'') and the Traffic Regulations

       Bike Lanes. The Architect of the Capitol is commended for 
     its efforts to develop a safe and accessible street system to 
     better connect all road users to the U.S. Capitol, Union 
     Station, and the National Mall by making cost-effective 
     improvements to Louisiana Avenue, Constitution Avenue, and 
     3rd Street Northwest. The plan, as approved by the Senate 
     Committee on Rules and Administration, would provide 
     protected bike lanes on these roads to safely connect 
     residents and tourists to Pennsylvania Avenue, the National 
     Mall, the U.S. Capitol, Union Station, and the Metropolitan 
     Branch Trail. As the AOC works during fiscal year 2017 to 
     develop detailed specifications on these new bike lanes, the 
     AOC should continue to coordinate with the District of 
     Columbia Department of Transportation, consistent with the 
     necessary approvals of the Senate Committee on Rules and 
     Administration, to pursue completion of this project in a 
     timely manner. The AOC is also reminded to ensure close 
     coordination with the Senate Sergeant At Arms and among AOC 
     jurisdictions to minimize impact on other campus projects and 
     priorities.
       This item relates solely to the Senate and is in accordance 
     with long practice under which each body determines its own 
     housekeeping requirements, and the other concurs without 
     intervention.

                          LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

     Library of Congress' subject headings, the Library of 
     Congress is directed to make publicly available its process 
     for changing or adding subject headings. It is expected that 
     the Library use a process to change or add subject headings 
     that is clearly defined, transparent, and allows input from 
     stakeholders including those in the congressional community. 
     The process should consider appropriate sources of common 
     terminology used to refer to a concept, including current 
     statutory language and other legal reference sources; and 
     other sources, such as reference materials; websites; and, 
     titles in the Library of Congress' collection.

                         Salaries and Expenses

       The agreement includes $450,667,000 in direct

       This amount includes $6,563,000 for information technology

       Primary Computing Facility: In lieu of House report 
     pertaining to the Library of Congress' Primary Computing 
     Facility (PCF), the Library's current PCF built in the 
     1970's, can no longer provide a sufficient level of data 
     center reliability and resiliency. The Library has conducted 
     a review of the necessary requirements and has assessed 
     numerous options to remediate the deficiencies of its current 
     PCF. $20,000,000 is being provided to move forward with this 
     important initiative. Once fully developed the Library's 
     Chief Information Officer shall provide a time-line and plan 
     on the Library's transition out of its current PCF to the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate.
       Digital Collections Management: The agreement supports 
     language included in Senate Report 114-258 and reiterates the 
     need for the Library to develop an efficient, organization-
     wide system for acquiring, managing, and sharing digital 
     materials. It is critical for the Library to have a 
     comprehensive digital collection management plan in place 
     that centralizes and builds on current expertise, staffing, 
     and funding. The Committees look forward to considering 
     future funding requests for additional FTE's to add to 
     current resources supporting digital collections as details 
     for such plans are finalized.
       eReader Program: The importance of having accessible 
     reading material to U.S. citizens and residents who are 
     unable to read printed material due to blindness or physical 
     limitations is recognized. In 2016 Congress authorized the 
     National Library Services for the Blind and Physically 
     Handicapped (NLS) to provide readers for electronic braille 
     (Public Law 114-219). This new authority is consistent with a 
     2016 Government Accountability Office report requested by the 
     House Committee on Appropriations, which found that NLS could 
     provide braille materials in a modern and potentially more 
     cost-effective way by distributing braille eReaders to NLS 
     patrons. In addition to the new authority NLS continues its 
     mission of providing materials in audio and braille formats 
     and players for talking books.
       It is encouraging that NLS is moving forward to implement 
     the braille eReader program. There is support for the 
     Library's current approach to, within existing funds and in 
     cooperation with an educational organization for the blind, 
     pilot the introduction of braille eReaders, and, with 
     information learned from the pilot, work with the network of 
     participating NLS libraries to scale the braille eReader 
     program up so that it can deliver the increased accessibility 
     that Congress intended.

                            Copyright Office


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $23,098,000 in direct appropriations 
     to the Copyright Office. An additional $39,548,000 is made 
     available from receipts for salaries and expenses and 
     $6,179,000 is available from prior year unobligated balances.
       Modernization: In lieu of direction provided in House 
     Report 114-595 and Senate Report 114-258, the agreement 
     provides the following with regard to the Copyright Office.
       The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations fully 
     understand and support the U.S. Copyright Office as it moves 
     toward modernization in order to provide quality services and 
     adapt to the continuously evolving copyright marketplace. In 
     support of these efforts, the Copyright Office's authority to 
     spend receipts has been increased and it is expected that the 
     additional funds made available will be used towards the 
     modernization effort.
       As a necessary part of providing quality services, the need 
     for a robust information technology modernization effort 
     within the Copyright Office to support the growth of 
     creativity and commercial artistic activity in our nation and 
     to effectively serve users and copyright owners in the 21st 
     century is recognized. Various legislative proposals exist 
     with regard to the Copyright Office and this agreement takes 
     no position on larger systemic changes being considered. 
     Given the importance of the copyright system to the creative 
     community, the Committees on Appropriations of the House and 
     Senate are committed to improving the IT systems as broader 
     discussions are being had by relevant Congressional 
     authorizing committees.
       Last year the Copyright Office was required to provide a 
     plan on necessary IT upgrades to the Copyright Office and to 
     seek public comments on efforts to modernize. A provisional 
     report was received on February 29, 2016. However, the report 
     did not include the level of detail or collaboration with the 
     Library's Chief Information Officer (CIO) as expected. 
     Therefore, the Copyright Office is directed, in collaboration 
     with the Library's CIO, to modify the plan to include 
     potential opportunities for shared efficiencies and cost-
     savings as well as ways the Library's CIO Office can support 
     the Copyright Office in its overall modernization efforts. 
     This report should also include any new funding strategies 
     based on the comments received from the public regarding 
     changes in fee structures. This modified plan is to be 
     provided to the Committees on Appropriations of both the 
     House and the Senate within 90 days.
       Without prejudice to the proposals on where the Copyright 
     Office appropriately sits organizationally, it is recognized 
     that there must be integration with the Library of Congress 
     given it is currently a part of the Library. It is expected 
     that the Copyright Office consult with the Library of 
     Congress' CIO on its modified IT plan and use of shared 
     services, where practicable, should be reflected in the plan. 
     However, with regard to copyright specific IT systems and 
     larger Copyright issues, it is expected that the Library 
     continue to defer to the expertise of the Register of 
     Copyrights.
       Copyright Expertise: The Copyright Office has offered its 
     expertise on copyright matters to the Executive Branch, 
     including participation in international discussions, and 
     expects the Office is expected to continue that important 
     role.

                     Congressional Research Service


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $107,945,234 for salaries and 
     expenses.
       Congressional Research Service Modernization: It is 
     recognized that the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
     adhered to direction included in Senate Report 114-258 to 
     examine ways in which the internal structure of the 
     organization may be improved to meet the challenges of the 
     ever-changing Congressional environment. The Director of CRS 
     has already provided a verbal progress report on this 
     internal examination to the Committees and will keep the 
     Committees apprised of any structural changes moving forward. 
     This obviates the need for a written report.

             Books for the Blind and Physically Handicapped


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $50,248,000 for salaries and

       The agreement includes $544,505,919 in direct 
     appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Government 
     Accountability Office (GAO). In addition, $23,350,000 is 
     available from offsetting collections.
       In lieu of the directives to the GAO contained in the House 
     and Senate reports, this explanatory statement addresses 
     matters on which the House and Senate concur and action by 
     the GAO is requested.
       Technology Assessment: GAO's work is recognized in the area 
     of technology assessment, since being tasked with this 
     responsibility in 2002. GAO has produced highly technical and 
     scientific reports in response to Congressional requests and 
     statutory requirements. These reports have included 
     technology assessments (TA), and other reports to Congress 
     that incorporate analysis of scientific, technological and 
     engineering issues in their evaluations of federal programs. 
     GAO has also produced best practice guides for use across 
     government on the topics of lifecycle cost estimating, 
     project scheduling, and technology readiness assessment. 
     GAO's work in these areas is led by GAO's Center for Science, 
     Technology, and Engineering (CSTE).
       GAO's CSTE provides wide-ranging technical expertise across 
     all of GAO's areas of work, including support to various 
     studies of federal programs with science and technology 
     elements, such as cybersecurity, nuclear and environmental 
     issues, and major technical systems acquisitions, among 
     others. Also noted is the work of CSTE's e-Security 
     laboratory and Cost Engineering Sciences groups which conduct 
     computer and network security evaluations and advanced 
     operations research analyses (including cost, schedule, and 
     technical performance), respectively.
       GAO has provided direct support to the Congress via 
     congressional testimony, review of draft legislation, and the 
     adoption of various report recommendations by Executive 
     Branch agencies. GAO is commended for providing key direct 
     technical support to various congressional committees on 
     technology-focused topics such as the U.S. Capitol Police 
     radio systems acquisition.
       It is noted that GAO is using rigorous methods in its 
     technical reports, including engaging key external technical 
     experts via group meetings conducted in partnership with the 
     National Academies, cost-benefit analysis, risk analysis, 
     technology maturity assessment, and scenario-based trend 
     identification.
       Given the persistent and growing demand for this technical 
     work, the Comptroller General is commended for his strategic 
     initiative to build the scientific and technical capacity 
     within GAO and encouraging further growth as the work 
     portfolio requires. GAO is encouraged to continue a 
     communication effort with Congress to ensure lawmakers are 
     aware of these services.

                OPEN WORLD LEADERSHIP CENTER TRUST FUND

       The agreement includes $5,600,000.

   JOHN C. STENNIS CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

       The agreement includes $430,000.

                      TITLE II--GENERAL PROVISIONS

     and care of private vehicles; fiscal year limitations; rates 
     of compensation and designation; consulting services; costs 
     of the LBFMC; limitation on transfers; guided tours of the 
     Capitol; and computer network activity.

   DIVISION J--DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED 
                   PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       In implementing this agreement, Federal departments, 
     agencies, commissions, and other entities are directed to 
     comply with the directives, reporting requirements, and 
     instructions contained in H. Rept. 114-693 (House report) 
     accompanying H.R. 5912 (House bill) and S. Rept. 114-290 
     (Senate report) accompanying S. 3117 (Senate bill) as though 
     stated in this explanatory statement, unless specifically 
     directed to the contrary.
       This explanatory statement, while repeating some House and 
     Senate report language for emphasis or clarification, does 
     not negate language in such reports unless expressly provided 
     herein. Language expressing an opinion or making an 
     observation in the House or Senate reports represents the 
     view of the respective committee unless specifically endorsed 
     in this explanatory statement. In cases in which the House 
     and Senate reports provide contradictory directives or 
     instructions that are not addressed in this explanatory 
     statement, such directives or instructions are negated.
       The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United 
     States Agency for International Development (USAID), as 
     appropriate, shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations 
     a description of the cost-matching arrangements required by 
     sections 7045(a)(2), 7080(c), and 8004(a) of this Act on a 
     country and program basis prior to the obligation of funds 
     made available by this Act for such purposes.
       In lieu of the tables contained in the House and Senate 
     reports, the tables contained in this explanatory statement 
     shall guide departments, agencies, commissions, and other 
     entities when allocating funds.
       The Act modifies section 7019 from the prior fiscal year, 
     and requires that amounts designated in the respective tables 
     referenced in this explanatory statement for funds 
     appropriated in titles III through V shall be made available 
     in such designated amounts and shall be the basis of the 
     report required by section 653(a) of the Foreign Assistance 
     Act of 1961 (FAA) (the 653(a) report), where applicable. 
     Section 7019 also includes limited authority to deviate from 
     such specified amounts and adds a new subsection that 
     includes exceptions to the application of the requirements of 
     such section for amounts designated in tables included in 
     this explanatory statement for International Military 
     Education and Training and Global Health Programs, and funds 
     for which the initial period of availability has expired.
       Proposed deviations from tables in title I in this 
     explanatory statement are subject to the regular notification 
     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations, unless an 
     exception or deviation authority is specifically provided 
     herein.
       For the purposes of this Act, the term ``regular 
     notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations'' 
     means such Committees are notified not less than 15 days in 
     advance of the initial obligation of funds.
       In meeting the requirements of section 7076(e) of this Act, 
     the Department of State and USAID shall include in 
     congressional budget justifications (CBJs) the justifications 
     for multi-year availability for funds requested under 
     Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Operating Expenses. The 
     Department of State, USAID, and other agencies are also 
     directed to include in CBJs the information included in the 
     Introduction of the Senate report under Congressional Budget 
     Request and Justifications, as applicable.
       The Department of State, USAID, and other agencies funded 
     by this Act are directed to notify the Committees on 
     Appropriations of:
       (1) reprogrammings of funds, as required by sections 7015 
     and 7019 of this Act, at the most detailed level of the CBJ, 
     this Act, or this explanatory statement;
       (2) significant departures in funding from the CBJ or the 
     653(a) report to be submitted 30 days after enactment of this 
     Act; and
       (3) plans for restructuring the department or agency 
     involving funding or staffing changes.
       CBJ documents, and operating and spend plans, shall not 
     suffice for purposes of satisfying special notification 
     requirements contained in this Act.
       As in prior fiscal years, additional funding designated as 
     Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/
     GWOT) pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
     Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) is contained in title VIII of 
     this Act. Such funds are intended to address the 
     extraordinary costs of operations and assistance in countries 
     in conflict and areas of instability and violence, 
     particularly in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa; 
     security, stabilization, and peacekeeping programs; 
     humanitarian activities; and counterterrorism and 
     counterinsurgency efforts.
       For purposes of this Act, the term ``extremist 
     organization'' means the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
     (ISIS); organizations affiliated with ISIS; a foreign 
     organization that is determined to be engaged in terrorist 
     activity, as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the 
     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182); and other 
     entities designated as foreign terrorist organizations 
     pursuant to section 219 of such Act. The term ``extremist'' 
     means an individual affiliated with an extremist 
     organization. The term ``extremism'' means the advocacy or 
     use of violence by such organizations or individuals to 
     achieve political or religious goals.
       The Secretary of State shall submit to the Committees on 
     Appropriations the reports required by sections 104(a), 
     118(a), 312(a), 313, 404(c), 405(c), 418, and 602(c), of the 
     Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (Public 
     Law 114-323) as well as the strategy required by section 
     301(a) of such Act.

       The Act does not include funding for any new, non-security 
     positions, unless specifically noted herein. The Secretary of 
     State may fill existing positions that become vacant due to 
     attrition, as needed. If the Secretary intends to create and 
     fill new positions, 15 days prior to posting such positions 
     or filling such positions with internal candidates the 
     Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations a 
     reprogramming request which shall include for each new 
     position: a justification; a description of the job duties; 
     the estimated fiscal years 2017 and 2018 costs; and the 
     funding sources to be used for such costs, including funds to 
     be reallocated from savings due to the elimination of other 
     positions, contract services, and other reductions or cost 
     saving measures.
       Funds allocated for offices and programs under the bureaus 
     listed in the table under this heading that exceed the 2017 
     CBJ levels for such offices and programs are in addition to 
     funds otherwise made available for such bureaus.

       The Act does not include funds for cash transfer assistance 
     or major infrastructure projects for countries in Central 
     America. Such projects should be financed from sources other 
     than the United States Government.
       The Secretary of State shall include in the updated 
     Strategy required by subsection (a)(1) the following 
     information: a clear mission statement; achievable goals and 
     objectives; appropriate benchmarks and timelines; an 
     assessment of progress made under the current Strategy; and 
     an explanation for any changes made relative to the current 
     Strategy. Such information should be described at both the 
     regional and the country level.
       Following the submission of the updated Strategy, and prior 
     to the obligation of funds made available pursuant to 
     subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of State, in coordination 
     with the USAID Administrator, shall follow the directives in 
     the House report under this section regarding the plan for 
     monitoring and evaluation. Not later than October 30, 2017, 
     the plan and results shall be submitted to the appropriate 
     congressional committees and posted to the Department of 
     State and USAID Web sites.
       In accordance with subsection (a)(3), the multi-year spend 
     plan shall describe in detail the proposed uses of assistance 
     from this Act for each country and the amounts allocated from 
     prior Acts making appropriations for the Department of State, 
     foreign operations, and related programs to support the 
     Strategy. The plan shall also describe: how such assistance 
     differs from, complements, and leverages funds allocated by 
     each foreign government, other donors (including 
     international financial institutions), and other United 
     States Government agencies; the amounts of funding from such 
     sources; funds planned to be transferred or otherwise 
     provided to other United States government agencies, 
     international financial institutions, and commissions, and 
     the purpose; and the funding levels planned for each of the 
     central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
       The Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees on 
     Appropriations prior to: submitting any certification made 
     pursuant to subsection (a)(4); any suspension of assistance 
     made pursuant to subsection (a)(5); and any transfer of funds 
     made pursuant to subsection (a)(6).
       In making the certification pursuant to subsection 
     (a)(4)(B)(vii), the Secretary of State shall determine, among 
     other things, whether such government is providing 
     commissions with full access to information and documents in 
     its possession, including budgetary information. The 
     certification requirement in this clause shall not apply to 
     the Government of El Salvador unless a similar commission is 
     established in that country.
       The agreement supports efforts to strengthen the rule of 
     law by combating corruption and impunity in Central America. 
     Within the total funding provided for the United States 
     Strategy for Engagement in Central America, funds for certain 
     organizations and offices are allocated according to the

       The Secretary of State is directed to implement the 
     recommendation in the Senate report under Assistance for 
     Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia regarding the Anglo-Irish 
     Agreement Support Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-415).
     Section 7048. United Nations
       Subsection (f) prohibits the use of funds for the design, 
     renovation, or construction of the UN Headquarters in New 
     York and no such funds were requested for fiscal year 2017 
     for this purpose. In accordance with this subsection, any 
     operating plan submitted shall include a list of ongoing and 
     new capital projects funded by the plan. The following 
     information shall also be included for each capital project 
     with an estimated total assessed cost to all member states in 
     excess of $100,000,000 over the life of the project: (1) the 
     justification for the project; (2) a detailed summary of the 
     proposed budget, including costs for design, construction, 
     project management, building fit out, and technology and 
     security upgrades; (3) the assessed costs to be funded under 
     such operating plan and an estimate of the total assessed 
     cost to the United States for the project; (4) a description 
     of the steps taken by the UN and the Department of State to 
     keep costs within budget and the contingency plan to address 
     potential cost overruns; and (5) a description of the risk 
     management strategy and mechanisms to ensure transparency and 
     accountability.
       Subsection (j) requires a report on arrears. As a signatory 
     to the Charter of the UN and other treaties and conventions, 
     the United States has an obligation to pay assessed 
     contributions to the UN regular budget, peacekeeping 
     operations, and certain specialized agencies and 
     organizations. Scales of assessments for these organizations 
     are negotiated on an ongoing basis. Article 19 of the UN 
     Charter states that a member of the UN that is in arrears 
     ``shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of 
     its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of contributions due 
     from it for the preceding two full years.'' Therefore, this 
     subsection requires a report to ensure that the consequences 
     of the accumulation of arrears are fully described to 
     Congress. In assessing the impact to the national interest 
     due to accumulation of arrears owed to the UN and other 
     international organizations, the Secretary of State is 
     directed to consider the relative loss of influence at such 
     organizations to other countries.

     appropriated under Global Health Programs for an Emergency 
     Reserve Fund to enable the United States and the 
     international public health community to respond rapidly to 
     emerging health threats. Funds in the Reserve Fund are 
     available until expended, but may only be made available if, 
     prior to obligation, the Secretary of State determines and 
     reports to the Committees on Appropriations that it is in the 
     national interest to respond to an emerging health threat 
     that poses severe threats to

     and girls; for subparagraph (C), forensic assistance and 
     exhumation of mass graves, as appropriate; and for 
     subparagraph (D), the use of social media and training 
     programs. With respect to the strategy in paragraph (2), the 
     Secretary should review and incorporate, as appropriate, the 
     objectives of the United States National Action Plan on 
     Women, Peace, and Security, December 2011; the United States 
     Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence 
     Globally, 2012; USAID's Gender Equality and Female 
     Empowerment Policy, March 2012; and the United States Global

       Funding availability and transfer authority.--The agreement 
     provides two-year funding availability for the entire 
     operations account. This funding flexibility is provided to 
     enhance assurance of continuity of air traffic operations 
     during the annual transition from one fiscal year to the 
     next. In addition, the agreement includes funding transfer 
     authority of five percent among the activities in this 
     account. This transfer authority is provided to meet emerging 
     requirements as FAA works to accelerate the modernization of 
     the Nation's air traffic control system.
       Operations funding.--The agreement includes $20,000,000 
     above the budget request for the air traffic organization. 
     This funding level fully supports the air traffic operational 
     workforce, including the hiring and training of new 
     controllers to fill critical positions. The increase above 
     the budget request is provided to accelerate the safe 
     integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into the 
     national airspace (NAS).
       Aviation safety.--The agreement provides $11,500,000 above 
     the budget request for aviation safety activities. Of this 
     amount, $10,000,000 is provided to accelerate the safe 
     integration of UAVs into the NAS; and $1,500,000 is provided 
     for six additional full

     time equivalent (FTE) positions to support the certification 
     of new technologies and advance FAA's organizational 
     delegation authorization (ODA) efforts and strengthen safety 
     oversight.
       The agreement provides FAA with the resources it needs to 
     work with industry to achieve the goal of full utilization of 
     ODA to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of product 
     certification. FAA is directed to ensure that an ODA can 
     conduct all specified activities authorized and approved by 
     FAA in their procedures manual. When requested by an ODA, FAA 
     is directed to conduct a review of ODA limitations and remove 
     limitations that FAA determines, through risk analysis, are 
     associated with low and medium risk activities. These efforts 
     should include all FAA field office activities for the type 
     certification and delivery of new aircraft including the 
     Aircraft Certification Office, Aircraft Evaluation Group, and 
     Manufacturing Inspection District Offices. FAA's plan to 
     expand the ODA performance scorecard to all ODAs nationally 
     should be aligned with objectives to facilitate full 
     utilization of ODAs by all FAA offices.
       FAA is commended for continuing to strengthen international 
     aviation safety cooperation and improve the flow of aviation 
     products globally through strategic engagement with the 
     European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Transport Canada 
     Civil Aviation (TCCA), and National Civil Aviation Agency of 
     Brazil (ANAC). These activities should result in streamlined 
     validation and acceptance of type certificates and approvals 
     among these authorities. FAA is directed to ensure that the 
     efficiency of foreign validations is consistent with the 
     terms of the Bilateral Agreement and to assist U.S. companies 
     that experience significant delays.
       The full budget request is provided for Commercial Space 
     Transportation, Finance and Management, NextGen and 
     Operations Planning, Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, 
     and Staff Offices.
       The agreement provides $159,000,000 for the contract tower 
     program.
       The agreement includes language preventing the elimination 
     of the Contract Weather Observers (CWO) program, therefore a 
     report is not required.
       The agreement directs FAA to develop a plan updating the 
     controller staffing model for en route centers no later than 
     one year after enactment.
       The agreement directs FAA to review current policies 
     concerning reporting and data collection standards for severe 
     allergic reactions aboard aircraft. The FAA shall submit the 
     results of the review to the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations no later than 180 days after enactment of this 
     Act.
       The agreement directs FAA to regularly report to the House 
     and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the NextGen 
     Advisory Committee's objectives for the implementation of 
     airspace modernization programs.
       The agreement directs the GAO to submit a report to the 
     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the 
     importance of collegiate aviation flight training operations. 
     The report shall assess: the total capacity of collegiate 
     aviation flight training programs in the United States to 
     meet the needs of the nation to train commercial pilots, the 
     footprint of collegiate aviation flight training operations 
     at the airports in the United States, whether infrastructure 
     beyond that necessary for operations of commercial air 
     carriers is needed at airports with collegiate aviation 
     flight training operations, and the cost of additional 
     infrastructure if such infrastructure is warranted. 
     Additionally, the report should identify available funding 
     sources and recommendations for improving technical and 
     financial assistance to airports to construct such 
     infrastructure.

       The agreement provides $32,800,000 for separation 
     management portfolio, including $7,000,000 above the budget 
     request to advance space-based automatic dependent 
     surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) technology.
       The agreement provides $11,500,000 for on demand NAS 
     portfolio, including $3,000,000 above the budget request to 
     continue to develop and implement an integrated Cyber Testbed 
     at the FAA Technical Center.
       The agreement provides $43,800,000 for System-Wide 
     Information Management (SWIM), an increase of $15,000,000 
     above the budget request. The additional funding for SWIM 
     will accelerate FAA's ability to share traffic and weather 
     data with airlines and other users of our national airspace. 
     The Committee makes this investment with the understanding 
     that both the FAA and its NextGen partners put a high 
     priority on sharing data over SWIM's secure and reliable 
     architecture.
       The agreement provides $9,000,000 for VHF Omnidirectional 
     Radio Range (VOR) with Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), an 
     increase of $2,000,000 above the budget request to address 
     the rationalization and recapitalization of aging en route 
     navigational aids. These additional funds are provided to 
     expedite the issuance of a request for proposals to implement 
     a service-based procurement for Very High Frequency (VHF), 
     Omni-Directional Range (VOR) and Tactical Air Navigation 
     (TACAN) systems during fiscal year 2017, and to accelerate 
     the selection of a final contract.
       FAA budget documents report high numbers of reimbursable 
     positions, but it is unclear whether those employees perform 
     reimbursable work for the majority of their time on duty. The 
     FAA is directed to reclassify positions, as appropriate, in 
     order to ensure that the classification of positions as 
     reimbursable or direct accurately reflects employees' work.
       Telecommunications carriers have signaled their intention 
     of discontinuing Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) based 
     connections. FAA should prepare to adopt Internet Protocol 
     (IP) connections across all national airspace system 
     infrastructure, and it should utilize both near and long term 
     strategies to manage this transition without impacts to air 
     traffic services. Funding provided for two FAA programs--
     Surveillance Interface Modernization and Flight Interfacility 
     Data Interface--will support the transition from TDM to IP 
     telecommunications. FAA is encouraged to consider existing 
     technology solutions that may be implemented while it 
     continues to plan for modernization strategies.

       Advanced material/structural safety.--The agreement 
     provides $6,500,000 for Advanced Material/Structural Safety, 
     of which $2,000,000 is for the FAA to work with public and 
     private partners who provide leading-edge research, 
     development and testing of composite materials and 
     structures.
       Unmanned aircraft systems research.--The agreement provides 
     $20,035,000 for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Research, an 
     increase of $2,670,000 above the fiscal year 2016 enacted 
     level, to address the host of research challenges associated 
     with the integration of UAS into the NAS system. Of this 
     amount, $3,650,000 is provided to the NextGen integrated 
     laboratories, in partnership with NASA laboratories, to 
     provide for proofs of concept supporting the integration of 
     UAS into the national airspace. This effort will ensure 
     interoperability with national airspace systems through the 
     Unmanned Traffic Management system, which will create an air 
     traffic control network for UAS that will have the capability 
     to communicate with existing NAS infrastructure. In addition 
     to the amount provided for UAS Research, $10,000,000 is 
     directed to support the expanded role of the Center of 
     Excellence in the areas of UAS research, including 
     cybersecurity, agricultural applications, beyond visual line 
     of sight technology, counter-UAS detection technology, and 
     continuation of air and ground collision studies. 
     Furthermore, the Center of Excellence shall establish a UAS 
     safety research facility to study

[[Page H4082]]

     appropriate safety standards for UAS and to develop and 
     validate certification standards for such systems. Even with 
     this additional funding, private sector contributions to the 
     Center will likely continue to outmatch Federal investment.
       The agreement provides a total of $43,187,000 for research 
     related to environmental sustainability, of which $16,013,000 
     is for environment and energy, and $27,174,000 is for 
     NextGen--Environmental research aircraft technologies, fuels, 
     and metrics. The total level of funding supports the CLEEN 
     program, as well as the Center of Excellence for alternative 
     jet fuels and environment. The FAA is directed to use the 
     increase in funding for the Center of Excellence, resulting 
     in a total of $2,000,000 for the Center. The Committee 
     further directs the FAA to coordinate with NASA and the 
     Departments of Energy and Agriculture to continue research 
     and development activities into the development and 
     deployment of jet fuels as outlined in section 911(a) of 
     Public Law 112-95, including feedstock logistics and all 
     aspects of supply chains from feedstock through final 
     combustion.
