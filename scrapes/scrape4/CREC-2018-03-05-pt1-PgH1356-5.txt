                   PI KAPPA ALPHA'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor tonight to recognize and 
honor my fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity.
  I came from Alpha Omicron Chapter in Georgetown, Texas, Southwestern 
University.
  Pi Kappa Alpha is an international fraternity, a values-based men's 
fraternal organization with more than 225 chapters across the United 
States and Canada, approximately 16,000 undergraduate members, and over 
290,000 lifetime members.
  In 2018, Pi Kappa Alpha celebrates its 150th anniversary from its 
founding on March 1, 1868, at the University of Virginia, when six 
young men joined together and resolved to form a fraternity for the 
establishment of friendship on a firmer and more lasting basis.
  Their commitment to the high ideals of scholarship, leadership, and 
gentlemanly behavior remains strong to this day, which is the reason 
why I not only pledged my support to the fraternity, but why I support 
them today.
