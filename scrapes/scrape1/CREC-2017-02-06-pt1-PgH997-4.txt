                CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, a lot of history was made last night. I, 
too, want to join my New England colleagues to say congratulations to 
the New England Patriots on an extraordinary victory at Super Bowl LI.
  A lot of history was made. This was the greatest comeback in Super 
Bowl history where our team was down by 25 points in the third quarter 
to come on to victory. It is the only team to win in Super Bowl history 
in overtime; and it is an incredible display of the extraordinary 
talent of Tom Brady, the only quarterback in history to win five Super 
Bowls. This establishes Tom Brady unequivocally as the greatest 
quarterback ever.
  Also, congratulations to Bill Belichick for his extraordinary 
coaching, to Jonathan and Robert Kraft, and the whole Patriots 
organization for all that they have done.
  This was a great and wonderful night and an important example and 
display of determination and persistence. It is really a lesson for all 
of us to never stop fighting and, for young people, the importance in 
believing in yourself.
  Mr. Speaker, the victory last night by our great team, the New 
England Patriots, raised the spirits of our entire Nation.
  Congratulations to the Pats. Thank you for a great season and thank 
you for a great victory last night.
