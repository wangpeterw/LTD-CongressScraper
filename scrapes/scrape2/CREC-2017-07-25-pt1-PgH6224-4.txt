                      HONORING SERGEANT JOE MURRAY

  (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, last week, we all learned the 
tragic news that a military transport plane crashed into the 
Mississippi Delta. Sixteen marines, who courageously fought to defend 
our country, died from this unfortunate event.
  One of those marines was Sergeant Joe Murray of Jacksonville, 
Florida. I would like to take this moment to express our deepest 
condolences to Sergeant Murray's family and friends. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with you.
  Sergeant Murray was a husband to Gayle Murray, and a father of four 
beautiful children--Isaac; Annabelle; and twins, Judah and Micah. He 
was known for being a family man who cared deeply for those around him.
  Murray was a member of a special operations team and was promoted 
three times in the first 3 years he was in the Marine Corps and was 
deployed to Afghanistan twice.
  The son of a Navy man, Sergeant Murray will always be remembered as a 
true American hero. I will continue to pray for him and his family and 
for every soldier out there protecting our great country.
  May he rest in peace, and semper fi.
