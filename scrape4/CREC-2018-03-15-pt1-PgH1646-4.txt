                  HONORING THE LIFE OF STEPHEN HAWKING

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday our world lost the beloved Stephen 
Hawking, a man who spent his life defying all obstacles and pursuing 
the depths of human knowledge. He is the epitome of proving your 
circumstances don't define you.
  Hawking faced being told in his early twenties that he only had a few 
years to live. Fearlessly, he went on to not only beat those odds, but, 
along the way, demonstrated the beginning and the end of our universe 
as we know it today.
  Hawking taught us that, if you dare to dream and work hard, you can 
succeed; and I know he is responsible for inspiring many of our 
scientific minds, both young and old alike.
  As we celebrate his life, let us remember not only his 
accomplishments, academic and otherwise, but his fighting spirit. We 
are grateful for all he taught us and the legacy he left our world. Let 
us all remember him by embracing his steadfast determination and lead 
lives of action, as he did.
