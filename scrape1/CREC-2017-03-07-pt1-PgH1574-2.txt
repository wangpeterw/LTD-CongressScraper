            MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR ANTHONY ``TONY'' BEILENSON

  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform the House that my 
predecessor, Anthony ``Tony'' C. Beilenson, died over the weekend.
  Anthony Beilenson was known for integrity, civility, intelligence, 
courage, and a willingness to work across the aisle, even when that 
caused him to differ from the orthodoxy of his own party.
  He served in this House for 20 years, from 1977 through 1997, and 
served for 2 years as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence. He passed on Sunday, and I ask that Members rise and that 
the House observe a moment of silence.
