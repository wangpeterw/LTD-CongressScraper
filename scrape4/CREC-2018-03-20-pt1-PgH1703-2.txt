               HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE A HUMAN RIGHT FOR ALL

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this Friday marks the eighth anniversary of 
the Affordable Care Act being signed into law. In the richest country 
in the world, healthcare should be a basic human right, not a privilege 
for some.
  While the ACA is far from perfect--we know that--it made great 
progress, ensuring millions and millions of Americans that they could 
have health insurance, that they could have healthcare when they need 
it, making it more affordable, making sure that Americans with 
preexisting conditions were not denied coverage because they were sick 
or kicked off their coverage because they got sick.
  Unfortunately, though, this House has spent a good deal of the last 
year or so trying to take back some of those advances that we have 
made, essentially, putting more families in the position of having that 
economic uncertainty of not knowing whether or not their premiums will 
continue to go up or their copays will go up, or prescription drugs 
will be available but completely unaffordable to them; putting families 
back in the place where they are, essentially, one illness away from 
losing everything that they have worked for.
  We should work together because we know there are improvements that 
we need to make. We should work across the aisle to improve this law 
and move forward.
