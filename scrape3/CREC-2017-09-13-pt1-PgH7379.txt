            MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING SERGEANT STEVE PEREZ

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mourn Sergeant Steve 
Perez of the Houston Police Department who died on August 29, 2017, in 
the midst of Hurricane Harvey as he was in the line of duty.
  He served in the United States Army, and he joined the Houston Police 
Department in 1982. He leaves behind his precious and beloved wife, 
Lupe Cheryl Perez, and a host of police officers and law enforcement 
across the Nation.
  He became a sergeant in 1992. He worked in emergency ops and special 
ops and juvenile. He worked across the county. When he died, he was 
coming to work in the midst of the storm, because as the words were 
said often by his colleagues and heard from his family members, he had 
work to do.
  Today in Houston, he was funeralized. My deepest sympathy is to his 
family and how dismayed I was not to be able to be present with them, 
but I want them to understand that we were there in spirit and that we 
love the first responders who put the people of Harris County and the 
people of Texas before anyone else. That is what Sergeant Steve Perez 
did.
  Today we say to him farewell and thank him for his good and faithful 
service. He will never be forgotten for his kindness and service to his 
community. My prayers are with the family, and I ask now for a moment 
of silence.
