                     COMBATING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, most Americans get it. Frankly, it is just 
common sense. We can't continue to reward folks who come to our country 
illegally while those who work hard and play by the rules struggle to 
get ahead.
  It is way past time to fix our broken immigration policies in 
America.
  Today, the House is considering two commonsense reforms to combat 
illegal immigration, restore rule of law, and protect public safety.

[[Page H5307]]

  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act defunds sanctuary cities and 
cracks down on dangerous sanctuary city policies that shield criminal 
investigations from Federal immigration enforcement and puts American 
citizens at risk.
  Kate's Law increases penalties for deported felons who return to 
America and commit further crimes.
  Kate's Law was named after a young woman who was tragically gunned 
down by a five-time deported felon nearly 2 years ago to this day. It 
is outrageous.
  The Federal Government's first duty is to protect its citizens. I 
urge my colleagues to support these much-needed reforms and then do 
more to stop illegal immigration in the United States.
