                    DREAMER INFORMATION PROTECTIONS

  (Mr. O'ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in El Paso, 
Texas, hundreds of my fellow citizens will come out to SanJacinto Plaza 
to join us in celebrating, supporting, and defending those DREAMers 
who, across this country, are 700,000 strong,who were brought here at a 
young age are now contributing in, living in our communities, going to 
school, serving in themilitary, and helping to create jobs and grow our 
economy.
  I am also introducing tomorrow the DREAMer Information Protection Act 
to protect those DREAMers who voluntarily came forwardout of the 
shadows to give their personal information, their names, telephone 
numbers, and addresses to the Federal Government.I want to protect them 
and make sure that same government doesn't turn around and use that 
information to deport them, as theincoming administration has promised 
to end the executive DACA action and potentially deport those DREAMers 
on who this countryis depending, not just for our economic success but 
our growth and success as a country that has always gained from 
immigrantswho contribute to the American way of life.
