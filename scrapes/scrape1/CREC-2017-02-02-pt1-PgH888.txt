                              REFUGEE BAN

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, 2015: ``Calls to ban Muslims from entering 
the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.''--Governor Mike Pence.
  2016: ``A religious test for entering our country is not reflective 
of our fundamental values. I reject it.''--Speaker Paul Ryan.
  2017: Acceptance from both Pence and Ryan.
  What has changed?
  This unconstitutional executive order and its hasty implementation 
has created chaos and confusion at our Nation's airports. With the 
stroke of a pen, President Trump negligently and shamefully turned his 
back on thousands of desperate men, women, and children who were 
fleeing war zones. Green card holders and visa card holders who have 
been denied entry and detained for hours have dominated our news.
  This is not who we are.
  This ban will make America safer. That is an alternative fact. This 
ban emboldens our enemies, serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists, 
and puts our servicemembers in the Middle East in greater danger. That 
is fact.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to speak out just like they did in 
2015 and 2016. We can't afford your silence.
