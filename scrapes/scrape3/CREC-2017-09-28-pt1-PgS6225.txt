          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. Nelson):
  S. 1890. A bill to improve the understanding of, and promote access 
to treatment for, chronic kidney disease, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan 
Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act of 
2017, which I am introducing with Senators Blunt and Nelson today. This 
legislation seeks to make a real difference in the lives of Americans 
suffering from kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
  Kidney disease is the 9th leading cause of death in the United 
States, and unfortunately, more than 1 in 10 Americans today suffer 
from some form of kidney disease. More than 661,000 Americans are 
living with kidney failure or end-stage renal disease, which is an 
irreversible condition that can be fatal without a kidney transplant or 
life-sustaining dialysis. Of these, 468,000 patients in our Country 
rely on life-sustaining dialysis care to survive and roughly 193,000 
live with a functioning kidney transplant.
  This legislation seeks to promote research, expand patient choice, 
and improve care coordination for these hundreds of thousands of 
patients. Specifically, it would identify payment disincentives that 
create barriers to kidney transplants. The bill would require the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a comprehensive report 
on how and to what extent palliative care is utilized in treating 
individuals with advanced kidney disease and the effect of palliative 
care on the quality of life and treatment outcomes of individuals with 
ESRD. It would also direct the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) to evaluate and report on the biological, social, and behavioral 
factors related to kidney disease and efforts to slow the progression 
of disease in minority populations disproportionately affected by this 
disease.
  This legislation would improve access to pre-dialysis kidney 
education programs to better manage patients' kidney disease and even 
prevent kidney failure in some cases. Nephrologists and other health 
professionals would be incentivized to work in underserved rural and 
urban areas, and current payment policies would be modified to 
encourage home dialysis, which is not incentivized under the current 
Medicare payment structure. Patients with acute kidney injury would 
also be allowed to receive treatments through dialysis providers, 
therefore reducing costs associated with care provided in the more 
expensive hospital outpatient setting. Perhaps most importantly, our 
legislation would guarantee access to Medigap policies to all ESRD 
Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of age. Currently, Medicare patients 
under 65, whether disabled or ESRD beneficiaries do not have access to 
Medigap plans, even though Medicare is their primary insurance.
  Lastly, the bill would expand the options for patients by allowing 
individuals diagnosed with kidney failure to enroll in the Medicare 
Advantage program starting in plan year 2020 and reauthorizing on a 
permanent basis the Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plan for patients 
with kidney failure.
  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Blunt and Senator Nelson in 
supporting the Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and 
Treatment Act of 2017, which will improve the care of patients who 
suffer from kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be 
printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

       (1) Any disincentives in the payment systems under the

     donation rates and whether those practices and policies could

     to allow for the incorporation of new technologies and 
     therapies.
       (b) Contents.--In conducting the study under subsection 
     (a), the National Academy of Sciences shall evaluate the 
     current payment system for renal dialysis services under the

     palliative care in treating individuals with advanced kidney 
     disease, from stage 4 through stage 5, including individuals 
     with kidney failure on dialysis through any progression of 
     the disease. Such study shall include an analysis of--
       (A) how palliative care can be utilized to improve the 
     quality of life of those with kidney disease and facilitate 
     care tailored to their individual goals and values;
       (B) the successful use of palliative care in the care of 
     patients with other chronic diseases and serious illnesses;
       (C) the utilization of palliative care at any point in an

     preventing, and treating suffering. Such term includes care 
     that is furnished throughout the continuum of the illness 
     that addresses physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and 
     spiritual needs and that facilitates patient autonomy, access 
     to information and choice.
       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the

     to kidney disease;
       (2) efforts to slow the progression of kidney disease in 
     minority populations that are disproportionately affected by 
     such disease; and
       (3) treatment patterns associated with providing care, 
     under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social 
     Security Act, the Medicaid program under title XIX of such 
     Act, and through private health insurance, to minority 
     populations that are disproportionately affected by kidney 
     failure.
       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the
