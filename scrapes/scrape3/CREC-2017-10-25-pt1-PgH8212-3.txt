                         BRING UP THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, there are so many different issues. We are 
talking about tax reform, but I want to go back to an issue we have 
talked about for several months now, and that is the DREAMers.
  I rise today to call on the House leadership to bring up the Dream 
Act. The DREAMers who came to this country as children were brought by 
their parents for a chance to pursue the American Dream.
  These young Americans go to our colleges and universities. They are 
our teachers and doctors and serve in the military, and we cannot 
afford to upend the lives and dreams of these 800,000 DACA recipients--
people like Andres, a DREAMer who lives in my district. He came to this 
country as a child, and America is the only home he knows. He attends 
school here, earned his associate's degree, and became a building 
engineer. He built his personal relationships in our country and 
contributes every day to our society. His work, his friends and family 
are all in the United States. It would be a cruel mistake to force him 
to give all that up and send him back to a country he doesn't know.
  Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans support the DACA program. It is our 
responsibility to the American people and to the hundreds of thousands 
of young DREAMers in this country to pass the Dream Act now.
  Mr. Speaker, we should do so as soon as we can.
