  (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, on the campaign trail, the President 
talked a good game on trade that appealed to working families. But now 
that he is President, his promises ring hollow.
  He promised to stop outsourcing and shipping jobs overseas, but he 
issued 15 contracts since becoming President with companies that have 
outsourced jobs. He promised to hold China accountable and label them a 
currency manipulator. He reversed that pledge.
  He promised to drain the swamp, but he has done just the opposite. He 
stacked the Cabinet with wealthy insiders; and his White House is 
filled with friends, family, and a stunning display of nepotism and 
conflicts of interest.
  He said he would release his tax returns. That is a laugher. Breaking 
with 40 years of precedent, he has not released his taxes and claimed 
the American people don't care.
  Seventy-four percent of Americans want to see his tax returns. And we 
will never know the full extent of his conflicts of interest and how he 
stands to enrich himself in office until we see his tax returns.
  Congressional tax-writing committees can request them because they 
have the authority under IRC 6103, and I urge my colleagues to support 
this effort.
