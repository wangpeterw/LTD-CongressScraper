                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father, You are the God of our salvation. Thank You for this 
sacred moment of prayer. We think of Your goodness even in the night 
seasons, for Your ways are reliable and sure. Remind our Senators that 
before honor comes humility, as they seek to serve You and country. 
Give them the wisdom to put their complete trust in You, knowing that 
You will direct their steps. Lord, use them to do Your work on Earth. 
Keep them calm in the quiet center of their lives so that they may 
experience serenity in life's swirling stresses.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
