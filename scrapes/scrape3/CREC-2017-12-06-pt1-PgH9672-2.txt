        PAYING RESPECTS TO GEORGE WILLIE, SR., OF LEUPP, ARIZONA

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to a 
hero. George Willie, Sr., of Leupp, Arizona, passed away this week at 
the age of 92. He was a highly decorated Navajo Code Talker who served 
with the Second Marine Division from 1943 to 1946. According to his 
family, George delivered and received coded messages using the Navajo 
language at the Battle of Okinawa.
  His love for his family was unwavering and his commitment to his 
country was steadfast. Pat and I are keeping George's wife, Emma; his 
10 children; and his grandchildren in our prayers as they mourn his 
passing.
  A celebration of his life is scheduled for Friday at the First 
Presbyterian Church in Leupp, and George will be laid to rest with 
honors at the Veterans Memorial Cemetery at Camp Navajo.
