           By Mr. PITTENGER:
       H.R. 4757.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       The explicit power of Congress to establish an uniform Rule 
     of Naturization, and uniform Laws on the subject of 
     Bankruptcies throught the United States as enumerated in 
     Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4, of the United States 
     Constitution.
       Additionally, Article 1, Section 7, Clause 2 of the 
     Constitution allows for every bill passed by the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President to 
     be codified in to law; and therefore implicitly allows 
     Congress to amend any bill that has been passed by both 
     chambers and signed in to law by the President.
