                  RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of law 
enforcement not only in my district, but around the Nation.
  This week is National Police Week, and it marks an important time for 
our country. These men and women are an elite group worthy of our 
praise and recognition. They are true American patriots whose acts of 
courage must be honored and acknowledged.
  Too many heroes lost their lives in the line of duty last year. 
Multiple of them were in my home State of Texas, as well as in my 
district.
  Every single day, Federal, State, and local police officers around 
the country put their lives on the line to protect their fellow 
Americans. Mr. Speaker, I came up here to speak on behalf of all 
Americans and express our appreciation for our law enforcement. These 
are the men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping the peace and 
carrying out justice.
  Congress has worked and will continue to work hard to guarantee that 
these brave men and women are provided with the tools needed to do 
their jobs and maintain public safety. We will also remain persistent 
to ensure those who harm law enforcement officers are brought to 
justice.
  I applaud those in law enforcement who have voluntarily put their 
lives on the line for all of us.
  In God we trust.
