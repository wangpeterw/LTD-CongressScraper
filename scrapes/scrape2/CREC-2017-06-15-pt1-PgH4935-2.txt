    PRAYING FOR A FULL RECOVERY TO THOSE INJURED IN BASEBALL TRAGEDY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, my heart is with the families and the loved 
ones of our colleagues, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and all 
those injured yesterday: Crystal Griner, David Bailey, Matt Mika, and 
Zack Barth.
  Steve, we are all praying for you and your wife, Jennifer, and your 
children. We wish you a happy Father's Day and a full recovery.
  To the U.S. Capitol Police, you showed yesterday why you are the best 
at what you do.
  David Bailey and Crystal Griner, without hesitation, leaped into 
action. Had they not done that, the story could be very different 
today. We are grateful for your service yesterday and every day.
