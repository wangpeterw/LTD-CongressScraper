                             IRISH LESSONS

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I join with 
millions around the globe to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. The United 
States of America would not be the country we are today without the 
enormous contributions of millions of Irish immigrants and their 
descendants.
  From serving in every war our country has ever faced and leading our 
country at every level of government, Irish Americans have done it all. 
Today, more than 33 million Irish Americans claim Irish ancestry.
  Tragically, our country didn't always welcome the Irish. During the 
late 19th and 20th centuries, Irish arriving on our shores were met 
with contempt, disdain, and with signs that read, ``Irish need not 
apply.'' But they persisted, and our country is all the better for it.
  So, today, St. Patrick's Day, I thank you and say thank you to all 
the Irish men and women who helped shape the great country we are 
today.
  Thank you, and happy St. Patrick's Day.
