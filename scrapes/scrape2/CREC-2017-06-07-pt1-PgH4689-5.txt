                 CONGRATULATING DEAN WILLIAM EASTERLING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Penn State's own Dean William Easterling on his appointment to head the 
National Science Foundation's Directorate for Geosciences, or GEO.
  Dr. Easterling was dean of Penn State College of Earth and Mineral 
Sciences prior to beginning his 4-year appointment last week. This is 
an incredible opportunity for Dean Easterling, and Happy Valley is most 
proud of his achievement.
  Science was part of Dean Easterling's life from a very young age, as 
his father was a medical school physician. He told our local newspaper 
that he was taken at an early age by environmental sciences, geology, 
and weather, and these interests have always stuck with him.
  Dr. Easterling has been the dean of Earth and Mineral Sciences at 
Penn State since 2007. He plans to return to the university after his 
appointment to the National Science Foundation.
  I wholeheartedly congratulate Dean Easterling on this momentous 
achievement. I wish him the best over the next 4 years. And I know that 
his hunger for learning and his advanced research skills will serve 
this Nation well.
  Congratulations, Dean Easterling.
