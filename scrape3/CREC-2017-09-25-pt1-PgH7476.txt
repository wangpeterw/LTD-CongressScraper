            PAYING TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL DANIEL FRANCIS KELLY

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal 
Daniel Francis Kelly, who, after being listed as missing in action in 
Korea for 67 years, is finally home.
  Danny was the youngest of nine boys of Irene and John Kelly from 
Pittsburgh's north side. Seven of his eight brothers served in World 
War II, one of whom was Medal of Honor recipient Chuck ``Commando'' 
Kelly. Danny idolized Chuck and wanted to be a war hero just like him.
  With Chuck's help, Danny enlisted in the Army in 1950, at the age of 
17. By November of that year, as part of the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd 
Infantry Division, he found himself at the Battle of Ch'ongch'on River, 
where he was captured on November 26. It is believed he died at the POW 
camp known as ``Death Valley'' in March 1951.
  Corporal Kelly, this week, your country gives you the funeral with 
military honors you have long deserved. Like your brother Chuck, you 
are a hero. A grateful nation says ``thank you.''
  Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine 
upon him.
