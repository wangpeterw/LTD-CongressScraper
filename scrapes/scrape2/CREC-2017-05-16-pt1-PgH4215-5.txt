             HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the men and women 
who protect our families, our streets, and our communities.
  Fifty-five years ago, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15 National 
Police Week. Each year, Americans come together to honor our law 
enforcement professionals and remember those who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice while protecting our families and our communities.
  I remember that infamous day, 9/11, when thousands were running away 
from burning and crumbling buildings; yet, at the same time, our police 
and first responders ran into the same burning and crumbling buildings 
to save lives. These brave men and women knew that they were running to 
certain death.
  Every day, police leave their homes knowing full well that they may 
not return that evening. Every day, they have our backs. It is our job 
to make sure that they know that we have theirs.
