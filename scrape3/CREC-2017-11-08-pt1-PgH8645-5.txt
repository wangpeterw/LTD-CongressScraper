                              GOP TAX PLAN

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the chorus of Americans 
across the country who are gravely concerned about the reckless 
Republican tax plan.
  Middle class families in my district know that this plan won't help 
to get them ahead, and it is not because they are doing the math wrong. 
The plan throws a buffet full of enormous tax cuts for multinational 
corporations and billionaire real estate investors, and it leaves 
hardworking families to fight for table scraps.
  Tens of millions of middle class families will ultimately face a tax 
hike, and the repeal of the State and local deduction raises taxes on 
many families in my district in California.
  For example, in Orange County, my constituents deduct an average of 
$6,500 a year using the SALT provision. This proposal sends them a 
bill.
  Republicans are asking my constituents to pay more, only to let 
companies that expand overseas pay less. That simply doesn't make 
sense.
  I urge all of my colleagues, especially my neighbors in California, 
to reject this tax hike on middle class families.
