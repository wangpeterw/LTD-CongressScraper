      CONGRATULATING SUSQUEHANNA VALLEY EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Susquehanna 
Valley Emergency Medical Services, a first responder organization in my 
district, for receiving the American Heart Association's Gold Plus 
Award. Only 1 percent of organizations nationwide achieve this 
designation.
  The designation recognizes the great length that Susquehanna EMS has 
taken to improve the treatment of patients suffering from severe heart 
attacks.
  Last year, Susquehanna EMS personnel provided lifesaving treatment to 
94 percent of patients within the critical 90-minute time period 
prescribed by the American Heart Association.
  These remarkable individuals who serve have taken incredible pride in 
their work that has had real lifesaving results in our community.
  To the dedicated men and women of Susquehanna Valley EMS, I and your 
community thank you.
