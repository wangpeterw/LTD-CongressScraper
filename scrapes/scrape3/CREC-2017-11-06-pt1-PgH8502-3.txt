    PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE 
          PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115-78)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days before the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice, 
stating that the national emergency with respect to the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction that was declared in Executive Order 
12938 of November 14, 1994, is to continue in effect beyond November 
14, 2017.
                                                    Donald J. Trump.   
The White House, November 6, 2017.
