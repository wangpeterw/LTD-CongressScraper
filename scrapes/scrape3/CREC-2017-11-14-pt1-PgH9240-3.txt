                      NOT A TAX BILL FOR OUR TIME

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this tax bill is not about the future. 
It is about our past. Millions of Americans, middle class families, 
will have increased taxes under this tax scam.
  In fact, in the State of Texas, 230,000-plus Texans will pay an 
average of over $6,000 more in taxes. That is a tax scam.
  In addition, Mr. Speaker, this is not a futuristic tax bill. This is 
not a tax bill for our times. This is a tax bill that implodes higher 
education. For instance, it does not allow the deduction of student 
loans or interest payments on those loans or tuition or expenses, 
eliminating the opportunity for educational growth.
  It eliminates the tax credit for research and innovation; again, 
stymieing the growth of the United States as it relates to research and 
innovation. Then to the large universities, the endowments that are 
used to help our students to build complexes to educate the best and 
the brightest are eliminated.
  This is a tax scam. It is a tax scam on higher education. It is a tax 
scam on hardworking middle class Americans. It deserves a resounding 
``no'' vote because we don't want to go back. We want to go toward the 
future.
