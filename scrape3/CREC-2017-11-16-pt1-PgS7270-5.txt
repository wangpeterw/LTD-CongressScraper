  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4374, which was received from 
the House. I further ask consent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table; further, that at a time to be determined 
between the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the Chair lay 
before the Senate the conference report to accompany H.R. 2810, and the 
Senate vote on the adoption of the conference report with no 
intervening action or debate.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  The bill (H.R. 4374) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act to authorize additional emergency uses for medical products to 
reduce deaths and severity of injuries caused by agents of war, and for 
other purposes, was considered, ordered to a third reading, read the 
third time, and passed.
