  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for years, Pakistan has provided 
support for America's enemies with American blood on their hands. 
Pakistan has supported the Taliban providing them safe haven, cash, and 
weapons. It is no coincidence that the leader of the Taliban was living 
in Pakistan when a United States air strike took him out last year.
  Pakistan harbored the number one enemy of the world, Obama bin Laden, 
until our SEALs brought him to justice. Pakistan's intelligence 
services has been dubbed the veritable arm of the terrorist group 
Haqqani Network. They have even cut off supply routes for our troops in 
Afghanistan.
  The Ambassador to Afghanistan has said that Pakistan supports 
terrorist groups in Afghanistan, but still Pakistan is considered a 
major non-NATO ally of the U.S. This status means that they get 
priority for significant benefits in the areas of foreign aid and 
defense cooperation. I am introducing a bill that removes Pakistan from 
this list of trusted allies.
  Pakistan is playing both sides. It is time to call it like it is. 
Pakistan should not be counted as a major non-NATO ally of the United 
States.
  And that is just the way it is.
