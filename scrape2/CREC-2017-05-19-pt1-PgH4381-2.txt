                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, this is a special week in the United States, 
here in our Capital, and across the country. This is National Police 
Week, and so I rise to honor our men and women in service across our 
country who wear the uniform every day: our first responders who are 
police officers who rush to trouble, as opposed to running from, and 
who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe. Every day, they get 
up and keep our families safe and our communities safe. They are our 
heroes.
  So this week, Mr. Speaker, Congress has welcomed many of these 
policemen and -women and their families to D.C. to recognize them for 
their heroism and to remember those whom we have lost.
  In Kansas, we are all too aware of the sacrifices that law 
enforcement makes to keep us safe. Brad Lancaster, Dave Melton, and 
Brandon Collins all made the ultimate sacrifice over the last year in 
my district alone, and they are on my mind this week and each and every 
day along with the other fallen officers across our country.
  Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the selflessness and bravery of 
police officers around the country who work tirelessly each and every 
day to enforce our laws, protect our communities, and save lives.
