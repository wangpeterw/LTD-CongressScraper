                       RECOGNIZING ANTHONY SMITH

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago, I had the privilege of 
presenting a Purple Heart to Mr. Anthony Smith of Warsaw, Illinois, in 
my congressional district.
  During the Vietnam war, Anthony served in the Army's 1st Cavalry 
Division. In 1968, on a particular bad day for our troops, Anthony was 
able to single-handedly take out several enemy machine gun units, 
protecting his fellow soldiers from harm and death.
  Anthony's bravery on that day was rewarded with a Bronze Star with 
Valor, and with a Purple Heart, although he was not given a physical 
Purple Heart medal at the time. Almost 50 years later, our office 
worked to help correct this, and it was one of the highest honors of my 
time in office to present Anthony Smith with this well-deserved medal 
in front of a crowd of his friends and family in Warsaw last Tuesday, 
October 17.
  I want to thank Anthony Smith for his bravery and service to our 
country, his dedication and commitment to our military, and to the 
entire Warsaw community for coming out to support this true American 
hero. We are indebted to his service, and we honor him today.
