              GOD BLESS OUR VETERANS AND GOD BLESS AMERICA

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, before I go back to the great State of 
Texas today, I just want to say happy Veterans Day to our men and women 
who have sacrificed and served so bravely.
  I want to say, from all those who I represent in west Texas, thank 
you for giving up your day so that we could have our tomorrow. You 
represent the very best of our American values, and we are the most 
powerful, the most prosperous, and most generous Nation in the world. 
We are the most free Nation in the history of the world because of you.
  God bless our veterans and God bless America.
