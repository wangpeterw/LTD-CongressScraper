                         FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, the Senate 
must act before the end of the week to pass a clean, short-term funding 
bill to maintain critical operations of the Federal Government. Our 
colleagues in the House will send us the noncontroversial provision 
soon, and then we will have an opportunity to consider it. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in voting to pass it. This short-term continuing 
resolution will provide us with the time we need to complete 
discussions on a long-term solution. It will also provide certainty to 
States to continue funding the Children's Health Insurance Program.
  Later today, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer, Leader Pelosi, and I will 
meet with President Trump to continue discussing an agreement to fund 
the Federal Government. I look forward to working together with 
colleagues in a serious, bipartisan way to address a number of the 
priorities of our Nation in the coming weeks. I hope all Members will 
join me.
