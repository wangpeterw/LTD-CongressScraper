                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Ron Dunn, New Hope Ministries, Akron, Michigan, offered the 
following prayer:
  Our Father and our God in Heaven, we praise You for Your goodness to 
this great Nation, giving us blessings far beyond what we deserve. 
Direct the elected leaders of this governing body to meet the many 
challenges that this Nation faces today and in the future. Give them 
wisdom to know what is right, and the courage to act upon it. Set their 
feet on the path of Your righteousness and peace. Strengthen their 
determination to give witness to these truths by the way we should 
live.
  Give them harmony that puts an end to disunity, love for one another 
that extinguishes hatred, and compassion that overcomes hostility. 
Inspire all people to pursue Your commandment of love for one another.
  We pray this in the name of God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob, and my God, Jesus Christ.
  Amen.
