 SENATE RESOLUTION 227--RECOGNIZING ``NATIONAL YOUTH SPORTS WEEK'' AND 
THE EFFORTS BY PARENTS, VOLUNTEERS, AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR 
        EFFORTS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIVING AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

  Mrs. CAPITO (for herself, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Udall, Mr. Durbin, and 
Mr. Moran) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:

                              S. Res. 227

       Whereas July 16 through 22 is ``National Youth Sports 
     Week'', a celebration of youth sports participation and all 
     of the benefits youth derive from engagement in sports;
       Whereas a primary goal in youth sports is to encourage 
     active participation by all youth in healthy physical 
     activities according to their age, interests, and abilities;
       Whereas the relationship between sports skills and life 
     skills provide young athletes with fundamental values, 
     compassion, and the good ethics needed to succeed both on and 
     off the playing field;
       Whereas, in 2008, the National Council of Youth Sports 
     (``NCYS'') reported that there are more than 60,000,000 
     registered participants in organized amateur youth sports 
     programs;
       Whereas youth sports offer a multitude of positive benefits 
     to participants that extend far beyond the playing field, 
     including--
       (1) improved academic performance, such as increased school 
     attendance, lower dropout rates, higher high school 
     graduation rates, and higher grade point averages;
       (2) increased health and positive physical behaviors, such 
     as improved health factors, and prevention of obesity, 
     chronic diseases, and other health problems;
       (3) social well-being, such as character development, and 
     exposure to positive role models; and
       (4) improved psychological health, such as decreased 
     likelihood of substance abuse, reduced instances of 
     behavioral misconduct, and high self-esteem; and
       Whereas National Youth Sports Week highlights the efforts 
     made toward--
       (1) promoting physical activity in all segments of the 
     community;
       (2) living healthy;
       (3) making access to physical activities easier by removing 
     barriers to creating youth development activities;
       (4) encouraging youth development activities and outcomes; 
     and
       (5) improving the safety of participating in physical 
     activities: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the millions of youth 
     throughout the United States who benefit from youth sports, 
     and the parents, volunteers, and local and national 
     organizations, such as the National Council of Youth Sports, 
     that make youth sports in the United States possible.
