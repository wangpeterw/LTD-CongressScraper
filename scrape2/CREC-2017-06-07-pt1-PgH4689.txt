               CONGRATULATING LOCAL HERO THALIA RODRIGUEZ

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a young and 
valiant member of our south Florida community, Thalia Rodriguez. Just 
17 years old, Thalia used her skills that she learned from her high 
school's emergency medical responder class to save the life of one of 
our Miami-Dade police officers.
  Major Ricky Carter was off duty, traveling on his motorcycle, when an 
unexpected crash left him critically injured at the side of the road. 
Thalia came upon the scene, immediately began to apply first aid to the 
injured police major. Realizing that his injuries were too severe to 
wait for the first responders to arrive, Thalia made the split-second 
decision to fashion a tourniquet out of a belt, thereby buying Major 
Carter precious time. Thalia's brave act that Sunday morning saved 
Major Ricky Carter's life.
  Thank you to Thalia Rodriguez, a graduating senior at Westland 
Hialeah Senior High School, for her outstanding heroism.
