                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE STIVERS

  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues from 
Ohio in congratulating our good friend and colleague, Congressman Steve 
Stivers, on his new promotion to the rank of brigadier general in the 
Ohio Army National Guard.
  This is a big deal. Steve is one of the highest ranking National 
Guard officers ever to serve simultaneously in Congress. I think that 
is really important because it gives him a unique perspective as a 
legislator and puts him in an unique position to advocate on behalf of 
our troops.
  The title is a great honor, but what is more important, in my view, 
is the fact that he earned it. Steve has been serving Ohio as a soldier 
for 30 years. He deployed to the Middle East during Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, while simultaneously serving as a State senator in Columbus, 
and he even earned a Bronze Star for his accomplishments.
  Since he came home, he has been serving his neighbors in central and 
southern Ohio as a legislator for more

than a decade. We are really grateful for that because he has been a 
faithful Representative in speaking up for his constituents.
  I want to congratulate Steve, Karen, and the kids on this exciting 
time for them. On behalf of the people of Ohio, I want to thank Steve 
and all of our troops for their service.
  Thank you.
