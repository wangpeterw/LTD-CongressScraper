              CONGRATULATING MINNETONKA BOYS TENNIS CHAMPS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Minnetonka High 
School boys tennis team on their recent extraordinary State tournament 
victory. The Skippers won their second consecutive State title, led by 
Senior Adam Thompson and Junior Ben Wheaton.
  The team worked hard to win, with a final score of 4-3. This close 
victory displayed their competitive skill, and the way the Skippers 
carried themselves after the victory epitomizes the virtue of 
sportsmanship and humility.
  Mr. Speaker, with their strong determination and commitment to 
excellence, these student athletes exemplify the very best of their 
school and of our community. They excel both on the court and in the 
classroom.
  I offer my congratulations to the players, the coaches, and the 
parents. Congratulations to the Minnetonka boys tennis team on their 
victory and becoming State champs.
