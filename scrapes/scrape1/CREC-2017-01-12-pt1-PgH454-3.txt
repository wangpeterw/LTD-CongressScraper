                     FIVE IMPACTS OF THE ACAREPEAL

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, the immoral effort to take away health care 
from millions of working families across the countryhas begun.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, thousands of families in my home 
State of Washington have been able to get quality healthcare, and now 
the Republican majority is set to strip away that healthcare coverage 
from those struggling to make ends meet.
  If they succeed, three quarters of a million Washingtonians will lose 
their health care; 55,000 young people in our Statewill be kicked off 
their parents' healthcare plans; being a woman, once again, becomes a 
preexisting condition where women wouldagain have to pay out of pocket 
for basic, preventive screenings and birth control; nearly 4 million 
Washingtonians, covered bytheir employers, would see their costs 
increase and coverage decline; and 50,000 Washingtonians who gained 
health care throughMedicaid expansion will lose it.
  Mr. Speaker, health care is a fundamental right and not a privilege. 
Instead of rolling back the progress we have made, weshould be 
strengthening and expanding health care to cover all who live in our 
Nation.
