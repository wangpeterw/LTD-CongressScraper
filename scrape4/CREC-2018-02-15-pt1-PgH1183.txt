                     CELEBRATING PENN STATE'S THON

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks one of the 
finest traditions on Penn State's campus, a 46-hour dance marathon 
called THON. THON is the grand finale of a year-long fundraising 
campaign that Penn State students undertake for the kids. Beginning at 
5 p.m. on Friday, more than 700 recognized dancers will put their 
stamina to the test and dance for 46 hours, without sleep, at the Bryce 
Jordan Center.
  But it is much more than that. THON is the largest student-run 
philanthropy in the world, and it raises money to fight pediatric 
cancer. The proceeds raised go directly to Four Diamonds, which 
benefits the Penn State Children's Hospital in Hershey. Four Diamonds 
ensures that families who are battling pediatric cancer are not faced 
with any costs, allowing them to fully focus on the needs of their 
child. THON 2017 raised more than $10 million. Since its inception, 
THON has raised more than $146 million.
  Mr. Speaker, I am always in awe of the power of our Penn State 
students and their care and concern for others. I wish everyone 
participating the best of luck.
  We are.
