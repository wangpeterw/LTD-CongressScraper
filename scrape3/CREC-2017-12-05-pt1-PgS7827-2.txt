                     NOMINATION OF KIRSTJEN NIELSEN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted to advance 
the nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to be Secretary of Homeland 
Security. Now it is time for us to vote to confirm her so she can get 
to work for the American people. By confirming Ms. Nielsen's nomination 
to lead the DHS, this Senate will take a serious step toward 
strengthening our Nation's security.
  Ms. Nielsen will be charged with leading the Department at a critical 
time. With her understanding of the challenges facing our Nation and 
her experience in prevention and preparedness, I believe she will excel 
as the next Secretary of Homeland Security. Her leadership will also 
help in providing continued assistance to the men and women still 
suffering from the effects of the recent natural disasters in our 
country. Our Nation faces a myriad of threats, and I look forward to 
working with Ms. Nielsen to address each of them.
