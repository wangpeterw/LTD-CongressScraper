                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Timothy P. Kesicki, S.J., Jesuit Conference Washington, D.C. 
offered the following prayer:
  Dear Lord, as we meet during this holy season, we are reminded what 
the American writer and theologian, Frederick Buechner, said of Easter. 
``Nothing, no horror can happen that can permanently, irrevocably 
quench the presence of holiness that is always there `underneath the 
everlasting arms.' ''
  We gather as a Nation this day to place ourselves in the protection 
of Your everlasting arms. We look out at Your creation, budding new 
with life from every window, reminding us that as You have raised Your 
Son to new life, You will continue to raise up all who turn to You.
  You can turn fear into promise, despair into hope, defeat into 
victory, and remind us that new life still flows in spite of 
everything. This is the joy of Easter. This is Your gift to us this 
day. May we live and proclaim this new life in all that we say and do.
  We pray, amen.
