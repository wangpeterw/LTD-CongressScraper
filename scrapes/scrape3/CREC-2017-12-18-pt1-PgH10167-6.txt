  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today marks 50 years since 
President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill into law officially 
establishing the National Park Foundation.
  The National Park Foundation works to enrich America's national parks 
and programs, safeguard our heritage, and engage the next generation of 
national park enthusiasts.
  Celebrating 50 years, the National Park Foundation is the official 
charity of America's national parks and nonprofit partner to the 
National Park Service.
  Chartered by Congress in 1967, the National Park Foundation raises 
private funds to help protect more than 84 million acres of national 
parks through critical conservation and preservation efforts. It works 
to connect all Americans with their incomparable natural landscapes, 
vibrant culture, and rich history. And, the National Park Foundation 
helps to engage the next generation of park stewards.
  In 2016, we proudly commemorated the National Park Service's 100th 
anniversary. The National Park Foundation launched the Centennial 
Campaign for America's national parks, a comprehensive effort to 
strengthen and enhance the future of our parks.
  Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly thank the National Park Foundation for 
all that it does to support our national treasures for another 100 
years.
  Congratulations.
