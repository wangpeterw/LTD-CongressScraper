                         HONORING CLIFF GLOVER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Ferguson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of the Third 
District's most upstanding citizens, Mr. Cliff Glover.
  Mr. Glover passed away last month at the age of 104, but not before 
touching countless lives in our community. His community service began 
at a young age in the Boy Scouts, an organization that he would work 
with for the rest of his life, earning the rank of Life Scout and the 
Silver Antelope Award for his service to the organization.
  Mr. Glover also served his Nation in the Civil Engineer Corps of the 
U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II, working on the U.S. Naval Air 
Station in Jacksonville, Florida, now known as Cape Canaveral.

                              {time}  1030

  In the private sector, Mr. Cliff successfully led the Batson-Cook 
Construction Company as it built many important buildings and 
developments throughout the southeast.
  I consider myself blessed to have known Mr. Glover personally, and 
his commitment to serving others helped inspire my own public service.
  I want to challenge all of my colleagues, friends, and neighbors to 
carry on his legacy of serving others.
