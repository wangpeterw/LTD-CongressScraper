                              S. Res. 301

       Whereas chemistry is the science of basic units of matter 
     and, consequently, plays a role in every aspect of human 
     life;
       Whereas chemistry has broad applications, including food 
     science, soil science, water quality, energy, sustainability, 
     medicine, and electronics;
       Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to improving the 
     quality of human life and plays an important role in 
     addressing critical global challenges;
       Whereas innovations in chemistry continue to spur economic 
     growth and job creation and have applications for a wide 
     range of industries;
       Whereas National Chemistry Week is part of a broader vision 
     to improve human life through chemistry and to advance the 
     chemistry enterprise and the practitioners of that enterprise 
     for the benefit of communities and the environment;
       Whereas the purpose of National Chemistry Week is to reach 
     the public with educational messages about chemistry in order 
     to foster greater understanding of and appreciation for the 
     applications and benefits of chemistry;
       Whereas National Chemistry Week strives to stimulate the 
     interest of young people, including women and 
     underrepresented groups, in enthusiastically studying 
     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and in 
     pursuing science-related careers that lead to innovations and 
     major scientific breakthroughs;
       Whereas National Chemistry Week highlights many of the 
     everyday uses of chemistry, including in food, dyes and 
     pigments, plastics, soaps and detergents, health products, 
     and energy technologies;
       Whereas the theme of the 30th annual National Chemistry 
     Week is ``Chemistry Rocks!''; and
       Whereas students who participate in National Chemistry Week 
     deserve recognition and support for their efforts: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week beginning on October 22, 2017, as 
     ``National Chemistry Week'';
       (2) supports the goals of and welcomes the participants in 
     the 30th annual National Chemistry Week;
       (3) recognizes the need to promote the fields of science, 
     including chemistry, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
     and to encourage youth to pursue careers in these fields; and
       (4) commends the American Chemical Society and the partners 
     of that society for organizing and convening events and 
     activities surrounding National Chemistry Week each year.
