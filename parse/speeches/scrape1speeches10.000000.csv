With all due respect, that is not window dressing. When you take a look at those numbers, it is clear to see that the bureaucratic state of our Federal Government is threatening our job creators and killing our economy.  Today, we have an opportunity to reverse course on the stifling regulations flowing from Washington by passing H.998, the SCRUB Act, as amended here by my colleague, Congresswoman Martha  The SCRUB Act will establish a commission to review existing Federal regulations and identify for Congress which of those place unnecessary costs on our economy.

2053,topic-id,656,"I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, my good friend and RSC chairman, Mark Walker, for this SpecialOrder opportunity tonight.  Mr.Speaker, Americans are hurting right now with their health care. ObamaCare supporters are quick to point out someAmericans who have actually been helped by After spending over $1 trillion of borrowed money, I would certainly hopethat there are at least some people who have been helped by this terrible law that was forced on us over 6 years ago by theDemocrats and without one single Republican vote.  Thousands of my constituents are demanding to be rescued from They have shared their individual stories with meabout how it has hurt them--higher premiums, excessive deductibles--how it has disrupted cancer treatments, forced them to changedoctors, and how it has even cost many their jobs.  Here is what real people are saying--my constituents. This is what they are telling me:  A young couple with three children, living in Tyler County, Texas, shared how their premiums have gone up year after year.They began with a $900 monthly premium and with a $2,500 deductible. The very next year, the premium went to $1,100, and thedeductible went up to $5,000. Then, in 2015, they were forced from a PPO into an HMO at $1,000 a month with a $6,600 deductible.These are individual deductibles. That is $33,000, plus the $12,000-per-year premium. That is an extraordinary burden on a youngfamily. This family tells me about their problem every time they see me, and they see me a lot because this is my daughter andmy son-in-law and my three grandchildren.  Gale in Deer Park, Texas, and Alisa from Crosby, Texas, wrote to tell me how their ObamaCare mandates have forced theiremployers to cut their work hours. They are losing hundreds of dollars in income each and every month. This 30-hour mandatemeans that this college student has lost out on hundreds of dollars in pay that she could have earned over the recent  Tim in Baytown, along with several others, wrote to share with me that it cost him his job. Paul from Harris County andFrank in Jasper shared how they have been significantly experiencing higher costs and a decrease in coverage. Roy in Pasadenasays that his deductible is now over $12,000. Ben and Carol, like thousands of others in southeast Texas, have had theirhealthcare plans canceled.  This calamitous unaffordability and poor coverage have inundated folks everywhere, like Linda in Vidor, who have to choosebetween their medications and food; like folks in El Lago--David and Sheryl--and Brian in It continues to tragicallyaffect folks every single day. Sharell from Jasper County has faced a doubling of her premiums, and Carol in Baytown shared howshe has seen substantial increases in her premiums and her deductibles.  Retirees who have worked their entire lives, like Jack from Orange and Glenda from Hardin County, wrote to tell me how theyare finding it difficult to afford their healthcare costs. Let's not forget that ObamaCare cut hundreds of billions of dollarsand services from Medicare, hurting the elderly.  Many who are sick have reached out to me, such as Randal of Harris County, who had their medical treatments disrupted byI hear all the time the firsthand accounts of hardworking folks who are at their wits' end under this monstrosity.  I am voting to repeal ObamaCare in order to provide relief to Brian, Brad, LaLa, Gale, Alisa, Abby, Tim, Paul, Frank, Roy,Linda, David, Sheryl, Brian, Sharell, Carol, Jack, Glenda, Randal, and the tens of thousands more Texans just like them.  Perhaps Paul in Deer Park sums it up the best:       It made it worse for me. It increased thecosts, and it      decreased my coverage.  That is the story I have heard for 6 long years, and it is why this failed program must be repealed and replaced with a planthat restores healthcare freedom to all Americans--health plans that are affordable and that meet their families' needs--a planthat they choose, not the Federal Americans need relief now.

1795,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the life of my friend Edward ``Ed'' Ed spent his lifetime fighting for equality, justice, and fairness for all Wisconsinites and Americans and did so with passion, joy, and a great Irish wit.  Ed was born in 1940 in Burlington, WI, to Edward and June His legacy of leadership and service began at a young age. He emerged as a young leader in Wisconsin through Badger Boys State and as student body president at the University of Wisconsin- Ed's lifelong commitment to social justice and racial equality began in college. As a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Council, Ed traveled to the South to join the African American civil rights movement. Following 2 years serving our Nation in the Army, Ed attended the University of Wisconsin Law School, graduating in 1969.  Thereafter, Ed joined the Minneapolis law firm Lindquist and Vennum and worked for the newly formed National Football League Players Association--For 12 years, Ed fought for labor rights for NFL players and workers, first as the NFLPA's attorney and eventually as its first executive director. He won greater freedom and economic fairness for the players, securing a fair share of profits for players who at the time needed second jobs to supplement their $35,000 salaries.  Ed was never shy or deferential. He spoke truth to power and challenged the system anywhere he found an injustice. He loved a good fight, and he took great pleasure in the battles, but he was always respectful and driven by the progressive values that guided him. In moments of the greatest conflict, Ed would often use humor to disarm others while making a point. Even his greatest adversaries appreciated his principled positions and enjoyed his wit and intellect.  After more than a decade with the NFL, Ed returned home and was named Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, where he took on big polluters and fought for environmental protections. He ran for the Senate twice, and in his bid for Governor in 1998, Ed not only fought for campaign finance reform, he led by example because he has always been deeply committed to changing a system where powerful interests have too much influence over public policy. While Ed came up short in his campaigns, he never gave up his fight for the ``little guy'' as a respected lawyer and as a leading progressive voice in our  Ed understood how important it is to pass on to the next generation our proud, progressive tradition in He founded ``Fighting Bob Fest'' to honor the legacy of former progressive Wisconsin Governor and U.Senator Robert ``Fighting Bob'' Each year, Ed brought progressives together from across the country to share this tradition and give people a voice.  Ed's list of accomplishments and successes is long and has one thing common: He was committed to something bigger than he was. If you asked him, he would say his greatest accomplishment was his family. He spent more than five wonderful decades filled with adventures with his wife, Betty, and their three daughters, Pam, Kathleen, and In recent years, his four grandchildren were his greatest joy. I know that their wonderful memories of him will stay with them always.  I feel so privileged to have known and worked with Ed since my early years in public service. Ed lived his life and pursued his work with persistence and purpose. He loved Wisconsin and stood up for people from different walks of life because he wanted to make a difference in people's lives.  Perhaps most important, Ed inspired generations of young people to enter politics and law, to engage in our democracy, to let their voices be heard, and to never be intimidated by those of wealth, power, and privilege. I am a better person for having fought with him in support of a more progressive Wisconsin, and I am honored to work to continue his important legacy. ``Forward!''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgS1575.txt,1558,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,March
2045,topic-id,1171,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina, for his leadership not only of the RepublicanStudy Committee as the new chairman--and I welcome you as the new chairman of the Republican Study Committee--but for hisleadership on issues related to the importance of repealing this disastrous law that is making life harder on the Americanpeople; and not just repealing it, but replacing it with policy ideas that put power back in the hands of patients, theirfamilies, and their doctors instead of driving up costs, forcing people to lose their healthcare plans, forcing the governmentto ration health care. We need a better way.  I am proud to say that we are supporting not just repealing ObamaCare here tonight, but bringing to the American people someconstructive, positive ideas that will make life easier for them and improve their lives through better patient-centered healthcare.  Mr.Speaker, Kentucky was once portrayed by President Obama, a red State, as a model of the implementation of ObamaCare.Yet, every day in Kentucky, in my district in central and eastern Kentucky, I hear stories from families and small businessesand individuals who have been hurt by this disastrous law.  Now, over the next few weeks, as President-elect Trump comes into office and as this Congress revisits the issue ofhealthcare reform, I expect we will hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle, arguments like ``Don't repealWe have 20 million new Americans who have insurance.''  But that statistic needs to be scrutinized because the truth of the matter is ObamaCare forced people to lose their healthcare. In many cases, and in Kentucky as an example, many of my constituents lost high-quality, private, commercial healthinsurance through their workplace, and millions of Americans received cancellation notices in the mail. Their small employerstold them that they were going to have to change their health plans because of this law.  So not only do we see now skyrocketing costs for those who currently have health insurance, but many Americans who ourfriends on the other side of the aisle say now are insured or covered, these are folks who lost their health insurance before.  What happened?  They lost high-quality, job-based health insurance, and so they were forced into these exchanges. In Kentucky it was calledIn many cases, they went to the cheapest plan available, which happened to be Well, my fellow Americans,access to a waiting line is not access to health care. Unfortunately, Medicaid is oftentimes access to a waiting line, and it isnot access to true health care.  President Obama's promise that his healthcare law would help people has not turned out to be the case. In terms of cost,remember, this is called the Affordable Care Act, but it is anything but affordable because even though he promised thatpremiums would decline[[Page H375]]by $2,500 a year for the average family, premiums have actually increased for hardworkingPremiums have increased for 11 million people, according to a report by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.Millions of Americans, as I said before, lost previous coverage or had to change doctors due to this disastrous law.  Take, for example, Laura in my congressional district in Laura is a young mother who had a baby girl, Catherine.Catherine was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, ventricular septal defect at birth, which is basically a hole in thewall of the heart. They needed high-quality pediatric cardiology to help So they got a specialist at BostonChildren's Of course, a long way away from Kentucky, but they wanted the best, of course, for their daughter. WhenObamaCare went into effect, unfortunately they lost their job-based health insurance that allowed them to access thesespecialists up in Boston for The result was, they lost their doctor.  What do you think a young mother and a young father are going to do in that situation?  Guess what, they had to find a very expensive policy to cover a Boston surgeon out of network out of State, and so theircosts skyrocketed.  This is the kind of thing that was happening to millions of Americans as a result of  Look, ObamaCare obviously reduced choice and competition. There are now only three plans participating in the ObamaCareexchange in Kentucky, one of which covers a full 78 percent of the State's individual marketplace enrollees. In many Statesthere is only one plan on the exchange. This has left too many families with no choice but to purchase high-deductible, high-premium coverage. In Kentucky, insurance plans have been forced to raise premiums by 23 percent in 2017 alone.  There is a better way, and the better way is healthcare reform that is focused on the patient, not putting bureaucrats incharge, not taking away choices, not driving up costs, not creating narrow networks for people, not forcing people out of theirhigh-quality private health insurance into government-run health care, but, instead, empowering patients to access moreaffordable private coverage.  And one of the ways we can lower the cost of health care, make it more affordable for people to access high-quality privatehealth insurance, is medical malpractice reform.  Frivolous lawsuits, junk lawsuits, have driven up the cost of health care in this country significantly. One of the fatalflaws of ObamaCare is that it never addressed this cost of healthcare inflation.  Over the course of their careers, it is estimated that 75 percent of all physicians will face a malpractice claim. Now, tobe sure, some of those cases of medical negligence are legitimate. And, of course, those plaintiffs should be able to fullyrecover damages for those cases of genuine actual malpractice. But for these frivolous lawsuits, that is driving up the cost ofcare. The fact that ObamaCare never even dealt with that issue is a fundamental flaw in the previous efforts to reform ourhealthcare system.  So I am a proud cosponsor of the Republican Study Committee's America Health Care Reform In the American Health CareReform Act is legislation that I introduced with Senator Barrasso called the Saving Lives, Saving Costs This doesn'tcap damages for cases of actual malpractice, but if there is a frivolous claim, if the liability climate is producing frivolouslawsuits, what we say is this: If you are a hospital or a doctor or a nurse and you practice in accordance with peer reviewed,evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, that there should be a higher standard of proof for that plaintiff to get to a jurytrial.  We want a safe harbor for our outstanding medical professionals who practice in accordance with the latest state-of-the-artguidelines on how to take care of patients.  So this does two things. Number one, it raises the standard of care. We are helping people access better, higher-qualitymedicine in this country with this legislation; and we are cutting out frivolous lawsuits, this litigation lottery that isdriving up the cost of health care for all  This is the kind of reform that, if enacted, would replace ObamaCare with reforms that would actually lower the cost ofhealth care without growing government.  I applaud the efforts of the Republican Study Committee for offering real solutions that will put patients and doctors incharge again and not Washington, D.

1894,topic-id,389,"Madam Chair, my amendment today is meant to address only one of several troubling provisions in the bill.  As my colleagues have pointed out, the SCRUB Act is a radical approach to deregulation and would prioritize cost savings through repeal of rules without considering their public benefit. The underlying bill would also prohibit agencies from making any new rules--even in the case of an imminent threat to public health or safety--unless the cost is offset by repealing an existing rule.  We have heard often on this floor my Republican friends rail against regulations promulgated by faceless bureaucrats. Well, this bill seeks to accomplish all of this through the work of an unelected commission--faceless--with virtually unlimited subpoena authority and jurisdiction over every existing regulation.  This body would work in the shadows to roll back environmental and workplace protections, putting dollars and cents over public health. The legislation grants so much in the way of authority, but comes with so little in the way of oversight, transparency, or public accountability.  President Trump and my friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk a lot about draining the swamp. Madam Chair, what the Republicans are proposing today makes a swamp look like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, all at the cost of $30 million to the American taxpayer.  My amendment today would bring a modicum of transparency and ethical oversight to the shadow bureaucracy by requiring commission members to follow the same financial disclosure rules as Members of Congress, congressional staff, or any Federal official.  My amendment would also ensure that commission members don't come in through the ``revolving door'' by inserting a requirement that the individual must not have been a registered lobbyist at any point during the previous 2 years. Congress not only has the authority, but the duty to review existing regulations and, when necessary, to mandate reforms.  But I understand why Republicans want to delegate this work. Because who wants to be the one to recommend rolling back rules governing clean air, clean water, food safety, workplace protections, domestic violence, victim protections, and many other rules that are in place to keep Americans healthy and safe?  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment simply to give transparency, openness, and clarity to the people who will be making the decisions under the SCRUB  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1370.txt,2272,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,January

1955,topic-id,509,"Madam President, I rise today to honor Jim Rollins, an Arkansan who has dedicated his life to public education. Rollins is the superintendent of the Springdale, AR, public schools, where he has served since 1980.  Rollins started his career in the classroom as a science teacher in North Little Since that time, he has consistently sought to provide students with a quality education. The work he has done leading Springdale's public schools speaks for itself.  Rollins' motto when it comes to education is ``Teach them all.'' This worthy goal has been especially important in Springdale, where enrollment has grown from 5,000 students when Rollins arrived in 1980 to nearly 23,000 students today. Many of these students are part of immigrant families where English is not their first language. More than 55 percent of the district's students are not proficient in English, and around 75 percent qualify for free and reduced lunches. As you might imagine, this has presented unique challenges to educators in  In order to meet these challenges and ensure that the school system is doing everything it can to provide these students with a great education, Rollins has introduced innovative programs that cater to immigrant families, including the unique Marshallese population in  As superintendent, Rollins has fostered an atmosphere where families feel welcome and understood so that parents, students, teachers, and administrators are working together to create a supportive environment that leads to growth in the classroom. In the spirit of engaging the entire family in the education of every child, Rollins has helped lead an effort in Springdale's schools to promote English as a second language instruction for students and parents.  This year, Rollins is once again being recognized for his outstanding efforts in the achievements Springdale public schools have enjoyed under his leadership. Rollins is being recognized as one of Education Week's 2017 Leaders to Learn From, which highlights forward-thinking district leaders who are working to enact and inspire change in our Nation's public schools. Rollins is certainly very deserving of this honor. You only need to look at the work he has done over several decades to understand that he has dedicated his professional life to improving public education outcomes for every child in the Springdale education district. The teachers and parents in his district have also had wonderful things to say about Rollins and his leadership in their community. I am so pleased that his trailblazing work in Springdale public schools is being noticed by national education organizations.[[Page S1765]]  Rollins has made Arkansas very proud, and we are so grateful for his leadership and commitment to educating children no matter where they come from or their station in life.

1821,topic-id,1235,"Mr.President, I rise today to support Mike Pompeo as the next Director of the And I thank my good friend, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Warner, for his comments.  I will vary slightly from Senator Warner in that I think the committee process provided every member of the committee a sufficient amount of time and opportunity to ask and to have answered every question that one can query a four-term Member of the U.Congress, a member of the House Intelligence Representative Pompeo made himself available to every member on the committee for a private meeting in their office, to the best of my knowledge, with no time limit.  Representative Pompeo came to an open hearing--which is unusual for our committee, but we do that with nominees--with no time limit. He made himself available to a closed committee hearing with no time limits. He answered over 150 questions for the record. Every member of the committee was given a tremendous opportunity to ask everything and to have it sufficiently answered by the nominee.  Maybe we won't explain what went through the mind of my colleague from Oregon to claim that he hadn't had sufficient time, that there were more questions that needed to be asked, and he made the statement in the light of day. Trust me, most all of the hearings we had and the meetings the members had were in the light of day--it was before 5 p.m. and after 8 a.m. in the morning.  In fact, there is a little game going on with Representative Pompeo, and I think it is similar to what we are going to see with other nominees. But let me tell you why this ought to be different. This ought to be different because of what is at stake. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency should be somebody who is above reproach, somebody who understands that integrity is everything--not just with the Congress of the United States but with the employees of the  This is an agency that operates in the shadows. The President gave a speech there on Saturday, and behind him as a backdrop were the stars of individuals who have no names, who have sacrificed their lives without recognition on behalf of the future of this[[Page S372]]country and the security of the United So it is absolutely crucial that we put somebody there who understands the value of the individuals but more importantly, the value of what they do for the security of  Representative Pompeo has been asked to lead what I believe is our Nation's most treasured asset. It is an agency that works in the shadows and requires a leader to be unwavering in integrity, who will ensure that the organization operates lawfully, ethically, and morally.  Just look at Mike Pompeo's background. He went to West He graduated 1 in his class. He left West Point and went to Harvard, where he became a lawyer, God bless him. He headed the Law Review at But he didn't pursue a legal career; he started an aerospace business and became the CEO of an aerospace business. He has had multiple successes in life, yet he ended up in public service. He ended up in the House of  When asked by the President on behalf of the security of the American people to serve at the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo said: Yes, sir, I will do it--only to come up here with a biography like I have read, with the trust and the integrity needed to fill the slot.  For Members of Congress to question whether this is the right fit, not because of the content of what he has accomplished but because they wanted to claim they hadn't had enough time--if we don't change this--and I say this in a bipartisan way--if we don't change this, good people will not respond ``yes'' when asked. If we continue to berate people who come here, because of things in their background that have no real, rational reason for exploration as to whether they can sufficiently do the job, then America stands a chance to lose the best and the brightest, regardless of where they grew up, regardless of the color of their skin, and regardless of their or their family's success. I say that to my colleagues in the hope that we will back off before we have done everlasting damage to our possibilities to get the right people here.  Representative Pompeo has honorably and energetically represented the people of the Fourth District in Kansas for three terms. He is on the House Intelligence House or Senate, I can't think of a Member of Congress who has traveled more around the world and spent more time at the CIA understanding the ins and outs of what they do, how they do it, and why it is important to the American people and to the security of this country, than Mike He is well versed on intelligence community operations, capabilities, and their authorities. He understands the nature of the threat we face here at home and abroad.  Some are going to question whether, in fact, his personal views that maybe there are events that will happen that will challenge Congress to change the laws are important. That is fine for him or me or for the President to question. The important thing is, How would he answer it if you applied it today? And his answer: I would follow the law. I wouldn't circumvent the law, I would follow the law, and the law says this today. Short of Congress changing the law, I will follow the law as it is today.  I am not sure you can have more clarity in an answer than that.  Mike Pompeo's intellectual rigor, honorable service, and outstanding judgment make him a natural fit for the As I said earlier, he is one of the most active, most engaged, and most charismatic individuals I have seen nominated in quite a while.  I ask my colleagues to support the nomination of Mike Pompeo as next Director of the Do it expeditiously. Treat him fairly. Don't paint him as for something he is not.

He has a background of proof as to why the Fourth District of Kansas made an incredibly wise decision, but more importantly, Mike Pompeo is somebody who can contribute in a significant way to the security of the American people, the security of this country, and can, in fact, manage and lead at the CIA without concerns as to whether there is the integrity of the institution, without concerns as to whether he might step across the legal line of what is appropriate, that every day he is there following the rule of law in this country, someone whose primary focus is to make sure that we as policymakers and the President as Commander in Chief have the best intelligence possible to make decisions about America's future and about America's security.  I hope it won't take 6 hours today, but we are in the first hour of debate.

2088,topic-id,775,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 210 provides for consideration of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017.  President Trump promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is negatively affecting our economy and causing great hardship on the American people. Congress is responding this week with multiple bills to do just that.  After years of endless premium increases, we must take steps to make health insurance more accessible and affordable, including for small businesses that employ the majority of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, will do just[[Page H2261]]that by helping to level inequalities between large and small employers, ultimately making health insurance more affordable for millions of  Simply put, the Small Business Health Fairness Act will empower small businesses to band together through association health plans to purchase health insurance. This will allow them to increase their bargaining power, negotiating for lower health insurance rates on behalf of their employees, just like their large competitors do.  Additionally, the bill will allow their plans to fall under the Employee Retiree Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, and the Department of Labor, just like the large self-funded employer plans, preempting a myriad of State regulations that often make insurance unaffordable for small businesses.  The usefulness of this legislation is easy to imagine. For example, a small accounting firm might employ just three or four people while the largest firms employ tens of thousands. If that small firm could join together with others just like it to provide health insurance through their national association, it could have the same bargaining power and be subject to the same regulation as the firm with thousands of employees. This parity means more options and lower costs for employers and employees.  Mr.Speaker, our Nation's small businesses were hit especially hard by the passage of In fact, a 2016 survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that small businesses identified the cost of health care as their number one challenge.  An estimated 300,000 small-business jobs were destroyed, and an estimated 10,000 small businesses closed altogether due to the failed ObamaCare policies.  Since 2008, 36 percent of all small businesses with fewer than 10 employees have stopped offering healthcare coverage. This has resulted in less overall healthcare options for working families.  ObamaCare's compliance costs and mandates have resulted in $19 billion in lost wages for small-business employees.  The bottom line is that small businesses--the backbone of our Nation's economy--and their employees are feeling the pain of ObamaCare's failures and broken promises.  I meet with these small-business owners from south Alabama every day. They want to take care of their employees and provide them with high-quality health insurance. Through enacting the Small Business Health Fairness Act, we can help thousands of small businesses achieve that goal.  Mr.Speaker, I also want to point out that this legislation includes strong protections to ensure association health plans are solvent and that the families covered by them are indeed protected. A sponsor of a plan must be a bona fide trade, industry, or professional organization and can't be established for the purpose of providing medical care.  The sponsor must have existed for a period of at least 3 consecutive years before providing group health insurance coverage. The association health plan must be operated by a board of trustees and will be supervised by the Department of This will include minimum capital requirements and a requirement that plans have a stop-loss and solvency insurance.  Finally and most importantly, the bill prohibits association health plans from discriminating based upon health status and preexisting conditions.  Mr.Speaker, the Small Business Health Fairness Act is about ensuring our Nation's small businesses are afforded the same opportunities given to large corporations and labor unions. When similar legislation has been brought to the floor in the past, it has received strong bipartisan support, as I hope this bill will today.  Ultimately, this bill is just one part of our larger plan to rescue the American people from the failures of This week, the House intends to vote to repeal ObamaCare, along with its mandates and its taxes.  But we do also understand that the pre-ObamaCare status quo is not acceptable. That is why the House is already moving to consider bills to give Americans the freedom, choices, and control they deserve.  Our solutions are built on free market and patient-centered principles. By getting the government out of the way and increasing competition, we can draw down costs and help Americans obtain health care that actually works for them.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 210 and the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1400  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2260-2.txt,2197,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,January
2091,topic-id,884,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My colleague from Colorado raised an important question: What are the Republicans trying to accomplish here? It is pretty simple. We are trying to give freedom and choice back to the American people who lost their freedom and choice and control over their healthcare plans, who lost freedom and control over their health care because of an ill-considered law passed by this Congress several years ago.  He talked about the cost to American consumers. If you want to pass something that is going to increase cost to American consumers, this Congress did that several years ago. Look at the dramatic increase in healthcare insurance premiums, the dramatic increase in people's deductibles that have occurred since the Affordable Care Act--the so-called Affordable Care Act--was passed here in Congress several years ago.  We are trying to reverse that. We are trying to get control back. And, in fact, we know from the Congressional Budget Office score that it will lower premiums by 10 percent. We haven't seen premiums go lower in years. So if they want to know what we are trying to accomplish, it is plain on its face.  The gentleman referred to some amendments that he offered in committee. Every one of those amendments was ruled nongermane.  And for those of us that maybe don't understand a lot about what ``germane'' means, it is pretty simple. You can't offer amendments to a bill that aren't related to the subject matter of the bill.  The chairwoman of the committee ruled that he offered amendments that weren't germane to the bill that we have today. So the gentleman didn't lose because people were trying to lock him out of the process. He just offered amendments that had nothing to do with the underlying bill.  He talked about the fact that this underlying bill for the rule we have today will lure away young and healthy workers.                                  1415  Let me say it again. I said this in my principal remarks. Under this bill, none of these association health plans can discriminate against anybody. They can't do that. They can't say we are only going to let young or healthy people in the plan. They have to admit everyone. So there is no discrimination here. Everyone will be covered.  And remember how many people in America work for small businesses. All types of Americans work for small businesses. We are not trying to hurt them. We are trying to give them more opportunities to get better health insurance that will cost less money.  And if there was anything in here that would cause discrimination, we would have heard long and hard about that before this point. I would suggest to you, Mr.Speaker, that that is not a relevant argument to this particular bill. Every plan that is going to be[[Page H2264]]under this bill must comply with the regulations of the Department of Labor, just like big corporation plans have to comply with the regulations of the Department of  We are simply treating small businesses through these associations the same way we treat big corporations. We have essentially denied to the employees of small businesses the same opportunities to get good health insurance at a lower cost that their colleagues that work for bigger corporations get.  The reason the bigger corporations have this is because the Department of Labor comes up with a nationwide rule so you don't have all these different variations from State to State and allows for those big companies to do the things that they can do so very well because of their size to get better health care for an affordable cost for their employees. We are giving the same thing to these small businesses through their associations.  And remember, this is not just one bill. We actually just passed a rule. We will be considering another bill that will exempt, from the provisions of McCarran-Ferguson, health insurance so we get more competition into the health insurance market.  This bill is on top of that. It is on top of the AHCA that we will be considering later this week and other bills that will be coming, because there are a host of things that we are doing on this side of the aisle to make sure we restore freedom and choice and affordable care to the people of our country.  We are not removing people from health insurance in any of the bills that we are doing. We are giving them the freedom to choose. And that is what America is really all about: the freedom to choose.  Right now we are coercing, by law, people to go out and buy health insurance that they don't want. That shouldn't be done in We are going to give them their freedom back. And if they chose not to buy health insurance, that is their right as That is not taking something away from somebody. That is giving them their freedom back.  So I would suggest to the gentleman that, if he wants to look for something that is going to help the workers of America, this bill and the other bills that our side of the aisle are proposing will do just that.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to[[Page H2267]]     offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House      should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

The Code of Federal Regulations, also known as the CFR, has some 178,000 pages. These are the regulations that you are supposed to understand if you are in a business--small business, big business, medium-sized business. It contains more than 1 million regulatory restrictions. Every year the Federal Government adds, on average, nearly 12,000 new regulations on top of those.  The regulatory accumulation has considerable impact upon our economy. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory compliance hurts economic growth by pulling nearly $1.8 trillion out of the economy. Regulations are particularly hard on small businesses that don't have the legal resources and the wherewithal to understand all of the complexities. Many small- and medium-sized businesses will be doing things that they don't necessarily even know or understand could be problematic.  There is room for regulation, don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting there should be no regulation, but we are trying to clean up some of this regulation and weed out the good from the bad. The SCRUB Act will enable the government to do so, and that is why I appreciate our colleague Jason Smith for championing and bringing this bill to the floor again.  The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan--and I can't say that enough, a bipartisan--Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of Federal regulation. The commission's goal is to reduce regulatory costs to the economy by at least 15 percent.  The act charges the commission with identifying outdated, obsolete, and unnecessary regulations in need of repeal or amendment. The commission gives priority to those regulations that are 15 years old and older. I think that is an appropriate direction that they should go.  The commission will consist of regulatory experts chosen on a bipartisan basis and confirmed by the United States They will take a governmentwide look at the regulatory system, allowing for impartial and wide-ranging review of outdated and unnecessary regulations.  This is not a new or a partisan concept. In fact, in 1978, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order requiring agencies to ``periodically review their existing regulations to determine whether they are achieving the policy goals.'' In addition, every President since has required some level of retrospective regulatory self-review by those agencies themselves. In fact, it was President Obama who issued three executive orders on regulatory review. He required agencies to develop retrospective review plans and to set priorities for implementing that review.  The commission is tasked with identifying regulations that ought to be repealed or amended. The commission will use commonsense criteria to determine whether regulations are overlaps, duplicates, or just flat-out conflicts with existing regulations. After expedited congressional approval, agencies are required to repeal some regulations based on the commission's recommendations. So you have people who are selected, they are Senate confirmed, then they bring forward a package that is allowed to be viewed by  Some have said, well, you know, this is excusing Congress from its duties. Quite to the contrary. The committees, Members, everybody should be paying attention to this, but to have a bipartisan group go out and look and make a recommendation, then it is up to Congress whether or not to accept it. We need to go through the House, the Senate, and be signed on by the President in a bipartisan way because there[[Page H1371]]will be Members from both sides of the aisle who will be able to appoint members.  Other regulations would be subject to innovative, regulatory CutGo procedures. The CutGo process gives agencies flexibility on how to prioritize regulatory elimination. It allows agencies to choose which regulations to repeal or amend and at what time. However, new regulations may not be promulgated until equally costly regulations are repealed.  The SCRUB Act gives agencies the direction and momentum needed to implement the regulatory reform our economy needs. We all know that regulations can improve health and safety; but sometimes, with the best intention, these outdated and excessive regulations hurt our economy and put other people in jeopardy. The accumulation over decades is something that should just simply be reviewed. I think it is pretty hard to argue that a review process is unwarranted or unneeded, given the amazing and impactful status that it puts upon those things that are damaging our economy.

1819,topic-id,2005,"Mr.President, I had a chance to listen to our friend, the Democratic leader, and it is becoming clearer exactly what his strategy is for dealing with the aftermath of the November 8 election, in which Republicans retained the majority in both Houses of Congress and picked up the White House to boot. I realize it was a shock to our Democratic friends--the election that occurred on November 8 and the verdict of the American people, given the choices they were presented. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, believes that Democrats and the country are better served by being an opposition party--in other words, opposed to everything that is proposed by either the President or anybody on this side of the aisle.  Rather than working together with us to try to build consensus, to try to address the challenges that face the country, what they are going to do is to sit back and enjoy the failure--which is what they are hoping and praying for--when we try to do this alone. We know our system is built on bipartisan cooperation and consensus building, and I have to tell my friend, the Senator from New York, Mr.Schumer, that I doubt his party's political prospects are going to improve as long as people see them as a restoration of the status quo at a time when they voted for change. Rather than working together to find solutions to the challenges that face our country, they have decided to sit back, drag their heels, oppose, and say no to each and every constructive solution offered by either the White House or this side of the aisle. I really do hope they decide that this is a recipe for political failure, continuing to wander in the political wilderness.  At a time when the voters voted for change, they are arguing for a restoration of the status quo--the direction that the country, the majority of voters, and certainly those whose votes are reflected in the Electoral College felt was a wrong direction for our country.  So I believe that most Americans greeted the peaceful transfer of power[[Page S370]]as reflected by the inaugural ceremonies of last Friday with relief and welcomed a new day in the country.  My wife and I had the chance to attend those inauguration ceremonies. Let me first say to President Trump, the First Lady, and his family, as they start this journey leading the Nation, that I wish you well and offer my help, because I believe if President Trump succeeds and if his administration succeeds, then there is a better chance that the country will succeed, and it is not going to happen by opposing each and every idea of the administration, which our Democratic colleagues seem bound and determined to do, being seen as merely obstructionist and being naysayers rather than constructive solution finders for the problems that confront the country. I am very hopeful about what the future holds, and I look forward to working with the new President in the years ahead to strengthen our country.  One obvious way all of us can support this peaceful transition of power, which is the hallmark of our democracy, is by making sure that President Trump has the counsel and advice of the men and women he has chosen to serve with him in his Our Democratic colleagues at one point want to criticize the President for not making a smoother transition, while enjoying every difficulty encountered, at the same time by denying him the Cabinet that he has chosen to serve with him to lead the country.  We have said it before, but it bears repetition. On January 20, 2009, when President Obama was sworn into office, people on this side of the aisle weren't necessarily happy with the electoral outcome. Our preferred candidate did not win, but that didn't mean we obstructed President Obama's choice for his Indeed, we agreed to seven Cabinet members being approved on the first day that President Obama took office, on January 20, 2009.  Well, all of these positions are important and are necessary to make the transition of power in our democracy as smooth as possible. Posts such as Secretary of Defense and Homeland Security and the CIA Director, which we will be voting on later today, are particularly critical, given the national security responsibilities associated with them.  While I am glad we confirmed General Mattis and General Kelly on Friday, we should have voted on the nomination of Congressman Mike Pompeo to head the Central Intelligence  Mike Pompeo is well qualified for this position as CIA Director, but unfortunately some of our colleagues want to slow-walk his nomination. How is it that 89 Members could vote to proceed to confirm his nomination for today last Friday but still they denied us the opportunity for an up-or-down vote last Friday, which we should have had?  Our colleague from Oregon said that he wanted some debate during the light of day. Well, we were willing to stay as late, or into the weekend, as we needed to in order to get Congressman Pompeo confirmed, but, no, he wanted to delay it until today, so presumably there would be less competition for airtime on the evening news. I can't think of another reason he would have delayed that confirmation.  I just want to remind our colleagues that our country continues to face incredible threats, and they are not hitting the pause button. Instead, it is possible that some of our foes could try to test the resolve of President Trump and his new Cabinet during this period of transition, where everybody recognizes this is a period of vulnerability for the United  I am reminded of a sobering quote from the Director of National Intelligence during a hearing in 2016. Former Director Clapper, who served our intelligence community for more than half a century, testified: ``In my 50-plus years in the intelligence business,'' he said, ``I cannot recall a more diverse array of challenges and crises than we confront today.'' That is the former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, who spent more than half a century in the intelligence community.  So with that in mind, you would think that we could all agree that the President needs his national security Cabinet at his side, particularly his CIA Director, a Cabinet position integral to keeping our country safe. That is why, in my view, we must confirm Congressman Pompeo as the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency as soon as possible.  For those who don't know Mike well, he served in Congress for several years, including as a member of the House Intelligence And I have no doubt, as Director, he will do all he can to make sure that those serving in the intelligence community have the tools and the respect they need and deserve to keep America safe.  So we need to get this done and to get this done without further delay. Let's not keep the President of the United States from his team, a team that could help him better serve and better protect the people of this country.  And, even more, we need to have our Democratic colleagues recognize that the election is over. The votes have been counted. President Trump has been sworn into office. So we need to end the electioneering that has succeeded all of their activities since November 8. They haven't stopped the campaign.  The campaign is over. The voters have spoken. And we need to get busy governing on behalf of all the American people.  Some of the comments that were made on the floor last week by Senator Wyden from Oregon--when he objected to voting on the nomination of Congressman Pompeo, he raised the issue of surveillance programs and referred to the so-called 215 program that was designed to collect metadata, but not content, of foreign nationals. He referred to the USA FREEDOM Act, which Congress passed and which replaced the old 215 program with a new approach. But one thing he overlooked is that both the Senator from Oregon and I voted for final passage of the USA FREEDOM Act, as did Congressman They voted for the same piece of legislation, yet the Senator from Oregon wants to take the new CIA Director to task for apparently having some divergent views from his own, when they both voted for the same reforms in the USA FREEDOM That is why it seems so disingenuous when he suggests on the floor, as he has done, that Congressman Pompeo does not believe that there are any legal boundaries for surveillance programs. Indeed, in the Intelligence Committee last week, Congressman Pompeo, during his open hearing, said he would abide by the law of the land, as I am sure he will, and as we all must.  Surely the Senator from Oregon does not think that support for expanding access to certain metadata is grounds for opposing the nominee. In fact, 59 Members of the Senate and a majority of the Senate's Intelligence Committee last year voted to make clear that the government should be able to access Internet metadata with the use of national security letters.  Just to be clear, we are not talking about content. We are not talking about private information that is subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment of the U.When the government wants access to private information, subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy, it requires a search warrant, along with establishing probable cause to believe that a crime or threat is present.  So it is a little disingenuous to be arguing about metadata, which is not content, which is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, which doesn't require a search warrant, as a reason to object to Congressman Pompeo's nomination as CIA Indeed, as I pointed out, the Senator from Oregon and Congressman Pompeo and I all voted for legislation that he believes addressed the concerns he had with the previous metadata collection program.  Then there is the detention and interrogation policies of the U.Government post-9/11. It is time to turn the page on this chapter of the CIA's history. We need to focus now on how to defeat the threats of today and tomorrow, not relitigate the battles of yesterday.  But, to be clear, Senator Jeff Sessions, the President's choice for Attorney General, has made clear that the enhanced interrogation policies that were used with the approval of the Office of Legal Counsel and the authorities during the Bush administration no longer would be permissible because[[Page S371]]the Army Field Manual is now the law of the land. Congressman Pompeo voted for the legislation that made that change to Federal law, and he has pledged to follow it. So I am not sure what more we can ask of a nominee.  Finally, later today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on the nomination of Rex Tillerson, President Trump's nominee to serve as the next Secretary of I have known Mr.Tillerson for a number of years now. Over time, I have come to admire and respect him for many reasons. He has proven over a decades-long career in the top echelons of a large, global company that he has what it takes to represent not the shareholders that he has been representing but the American people throughout the world in the most sensitive diplomatic and international matters you can imagine. And, most of all, he has proved time and again that he is a man of strong conviction and character.  I have confidence that Mr.Tillerson will help the United States regain our leadership role in the world by unapologetically supporting our allies and our friends while keeping a check on our adversaries. He is, simply stated, the right man to lead our State Department, and I hope that the committee supports his nomination and that the full Senate votes to confirm him soon.

American Health care Act  ",CREC-2017-03-13-pt1-PgS1755-4.txt,1692,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,13.0,January
1953,topic-id,1237,"Madam President, last week our colleagues in the House of Representatives introduced the American Health Care Act--legislation that will deliver on a promise we made to repeal ObamaCare and to replace it with healthcare options that won't force people to buy an insurance product just because the government tells them to do so or penalize them if they don't but will replace it with one that actually fits the needs of their families at a price they can afford.  It is no secret that ObamaCare was oversold back in 2010 when the President said: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And by the way, an average family of four, he said, would save $2,500. That has not proven to be true.  ObamaCare, to boot, has wreaked havoc on our economy and on American families just trying to stay healthy. In my State of Texas, it has led to fewer healthcare options, skyrocketing premiums, and deductibles so high that insurance plans are rendered almost useless. By one estimate, about one-third of Texas counties have only one insurance option, and that is the case throughout the Nearly one-third of all counties in the country have only one insurance company offering plans on their States' exchanges.  The truth is, ObamaCare has never added up to better coverage at a more affordable price; it has never delivered more options--just the opposite; and it never kept its promises when it was being sold to the American people.  Now is the time for us to do right by the American people by delivering more access to quality healthcare at a price Americans can afford.  The American Health Care Act doesn't just tinker around the edges of ObamaCare; it is a complete do-over.  This bill, for example, repeals ObamaCare's individual mandate, the requirement that you buy government-approved insurance, and if you don't, we are going to fine you. That is repealed.  It repeals the employer mandate. I still remember being in Tyler, TX, and talking to a gentleman who owned a restaurant and who said he had to lay[[Page S1763]]off some of his full-time staff, putting them on part time, just to avoid the penalties that go along with the employer mandate. And by the way, he introduced me to the single mom who now, instead of working one full-time job, had to work two part-time jobs just to keep food on the table for her family.  This bill also repeals the medical device tax. This was an incredible tax on medical innovation which wasn't on income but literally on gross receipts, forcing jobs to move from the United States to places like Costa Rica and Central  This bill repeals ObamaCare's Medicare payroll tax increase, the net investment tax increase, the ObamaCare tax on prescription drugs, and the ObamaCare health insurance tax.  This is the full repeal of ObamaCare that we have been promising for years now.  I want to point out that this bill also provides unprecedented entitlement reform. Some of the main cost drivers for the Federal Government are not the 30 percent of Federal funds that we appropriate each year that are largely divided between defense and nondefense spending. Entitlements are driven by the fact that they are not capped or pegged to an inflation rate for Medicare, Social Security, and  This legislation actually begins to put Medicaid--the healthcare plan for the most vulnerable in our country--on a reasonable path to sustainment. This bill also makes sure that the States that share in the cost of Medicaid can manage their own State budgets in a much more responsible way.  This bill is the first real Medicaid reform since the program was created which, perhaps most importantly, gives more authority, more flexibility to the States to manage the dollars they spend, to manage not only the dollars they come up with through their own tax rolls but the Federal portion as well. And as I said, it puts the Medicaid Program on a path toward fiscal responsibility.  I believe this legislation is critically important across the country and for my State of Texas, too. In Texas, every other year, when the legislature meets and tries to determine how to allocate its budget, they work very hard to try to make sure that Medicaid isn't the single largest expenditure in the State budget. Right now, about a third of that total budget is spent on Medicaid alone, and the Federal Government essentially ties the hands of the State in terms of managing the healthcare delivery system to help those most vulnerable low-income folks in our  With this legislation, not only do States like Texas have the ability to manage the expenditure of the money to focus on chronic diseases--people who are using our healthcare system a lot because of the nature of the illnesses they have--but also to help encourage medical homes so that people have ways of managing their healthcare to stay healthy longer and to reduce healthcare expenditures.  This legislation will help Texas and the rest of the country have a way to rein in spending while serving those who need Medicaid the most. You will hear some of our friends across the aisle saying that this is about kicking people off of Well, that is not true. For those people currently on Medicaid, Medicaid expenditures will not change at all as long as they remain on the rolls. That includes those who live in States that expanded the Medicaid coverage from 100 percent of Federal poverty to 138 percent. Those people will stay on Medicaid as long as they are eligible. Under this new legislation, Medicaid is put on a sound fiscal footing so the program is still around for our children and grandchildren.  Another important feature of the American Health Care Act is that it establishes a patient and State stability fund to equip Texas and other States to meet the specific healthcare needs of their patients, particularly those, as I have said, with low incomes and those suffering from chronic illnesses.  It will provide more money to community health centers that do a lot of heavy lifting to make sure that families are healthy and that people get access to the treatment they need regardless of whether they actually have health insurance. In Texas, we have hundreds of community health centers serving more than 1 million Texans each year. Under the American Health Care Act, they will be able to do their job more effectively and keep more Texans healthy.  Responsible entitlement reform is something we should be all about. It serves the American people not just for tomorrow but for decades down the road. Most importantly, I believe what this legislation does is it finally delivers on the promise we made back during the debate over the Affordable Care  Now that the Affordable Care Act has proven itself to be unsustainable and does not deliver on the basic promises, the fundamental promises upon which it was sold to the American people, I believe it is important that we keep our promise to repeal it and replace it with more choices of affordable healthcare at a price people can afford. It is the conservative answer to healthcare that will empower individuals, provide more options and competition, and responsibly help those who need care have more access to it.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-13-pt1-PgS1755-4.txt,1692,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,13.0,January

He knows, from personal experience, that conflict is rarely just a big misunderstanding, something you can clear up with reset buttons, open hands, and nice gestures. Our enemies have made a deliberate choice to oppose our way of life, and if we are to protect it, we must be equally deliberate, clear-eyed, and hard-nosed in our defense.  I have every confidence that Mike Pompeo will do that. He has succeeded in everything he has ever done. After his military service, he excelled at Harvard Law Later, he started his own company and went on to serve as president of another. He is a community leader in his adopted home of Wichita, where Kansans have elected him in repeated landslides to serve them in the House of In the House, Mike is a sober, respected voice.  In short, Mike has spent his entire life preparing for a moment like this. It is clear why President Trump didn't interview anyone else for the job after meeting  It is a big job, and the CIA will benefit from new blood and fresh leadership. Mike is ready for the job. As he said himself, he doesn't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to protecting our security and our privacy. Some politicians may say things like that, but it is all talk. It is nothing but talk. With Mike, it is the real deal.  Don't take my word for it. Here is what prominent Democrats are saying about Mike Leon Panetta, a respected public servant and former CIA Director himself, says Mike Pompeo ``is somebody who understands the intelligence agencies, is smart, and somebody I think will be a good director.''  John Brennan, who just departed as CIA Director, says he ``looks forward to being able to hand this baton over to somebody who is as dedicated an American as Mike Pompeo.''  Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says Mike Pompeo ``is bright and hard-working'' and ``he is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director.''  I couldn't agree more. It seems, among the people who actually know Mike Pompeo--and who actually know the job--there are no last-minute political stunts or petty delaying tactics. They understand intelligence is deadly serious business and ought not be treated like a political football. In a world as dangerous as ours, with threats gathering every day, there is no more time for dithering. We need a CIA Director of the highest caliber, and Mike Pompeo is the man for the job.  I commend President Trump for this inspired nomination, I thank Mike for once again answering the call of duty, and I also thank his wife Susan for her love and steadfast support of Mike in the trying times and sacrifices that inevitably will lie ahead.  The time has come to put aside partisan politics and do the right thing for our country and the brave men and women of the I call on every Senator to vote for confirmation and to send to the CIA a strong leader, a wise counselor, and a fierce patriot.

1881,topic-id,716,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. The SCRUB Act would establish a $30 million commission of unelected--and I emphasize that, unelected--bureaucrats to duplicate work that agencies are already supposed to be doing. The bill would focus on the costs of regulations while disregarding their benefits and protecting the most vulnerable populations in our country, like the children in Flint,                              {time}  1430  If there is any doubt about this, one need look no further than the so-called CutGo provision in this bill. That provision would require that, when an agency makes a new rule, it must offset the cost of that new rule for the repeal of an existing rule. This applies even if the new rule is in response to an imminent health or safety threat.  Agency compliance with this CutGo provision would also be subject to judicial review, which prolongs the process even more. This would inevitably result in lengthy delays, as both industry and nonprofit groups routinely file challenges to agency decisions.  President Obama has already issued two executive orders to eliminate unnecessary regulations. On January 18, 2011, he issued Executive Order 13563, requiring each agency to implement plans for reviewing existing rules. That executive order requires each agency to: ``periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed.''  In addition, President Obama issued Executive Order 13610 on May 10, 2012, requiring agencies to report twice a year to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on the status of their review efforts. In November 2014, a report prepared for the Administrative Conference of the United States highlighted the impact of these mandated reviews, concluding: ``Implementing President Obama's executive orders on retrospective review of regulations, agencies identified tens of billions of dollars of cost savings and tens of millions of hours of reduced paperwork and reporting requirements through modifications of existing regulations.''  Congress has the authority and certainly the responsibility to conduct oversight to review existing agency rules and to recommend or mandate reforms, yet this bill would create a new commission, a new commission that would cost taxpayers $30 million to do what agencies and Congress are already supposed to be doing.  In addition, the commission's report to Congress on the rules it recommends repealing would be subject to an up-or-down vote by the Congress would not be allowed to vote on each regulation individually, and this would usurp the authority of  One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is that it would entrust this unelected commission with extraordinary and virtually unlimited authority to subpoena witnesses or documents. Section 101(c) of the bill states: ``The commission may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence relating to the duties of the commission. The attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence may be required from any place within the United States at any designated place of hearing within the United States.''  Most agency inspectors general do not have such broad authority to compel witness testimony. Yet this unelected commission would have this authority. This means that it could compel an individual to testify on any subject. For example, a schoolteacher could be compelled to testify about education rules or a senior citizen could be compelled to testify about Medicare or Social Security rules. This extraordinary subpoena power is especially troubling because the commission's jurisdiction is limitless.  There is no restriction on what regulations the commission can review. Three prominent law professors with the Center for Progressive Reform sent a letter opposing an identical bill in the last The letter said this proposal would: ``create a convoluted,[[Page H1372]]complex, and potentially very expensive new bureaucracy to review existing agency rules and make recommendations for the repeal or weakening of those rules with little meaningful oversight, transparency, or public accountability to ensure that these recommendations do not subvert the public interest.''  In addition, Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than 150 consumer, labor, and good-government groups, also oppose the bill.  This bill could have dangerous consequences for the health and safety of the American public; therefore, I strongly urge every Member to oppose it.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

This amendment would add another criterion to identify which rules the commission would recommend for repeal, specifically, whether an agency has complied with the requirements of title 5 U.S.C., section 801(a)(1)(A).  That section requires agencies, prior to promulgating a rule, to submit to each House of Congress and the Comptroller General a report containing a copy of the rule; a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and the proposed effective date of the rule.  So this amendment would require this unelected commission to report to Congress on what information Congress has or has not received. This just underscores the point that Congress should do its own job rather than passing this bill to set up a commission to do our job for us.  Like the other criteria in the bill, Representative McSally's amendment does nothing to address the SCRUB Act's focus on the costs of the rules. The amendment fails to make sense of the CutGo provision, which would result in the repeal of rules with little regard for how these rules have benefited and protected the American public.  The amendment fails to address the fact that agencies are already doing a retrospective review of regulations.  This amendment fails to reduce the $30 million price tag that the American public would be responsible for paying to create the unelected commission under this bill.  The amendment fails to reduce the commission's virtually unlimited authority to subpoena witnesses or documents.  This amendment is nothing more than a window dressing, and it is nice.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness  As a surgeon in north Florida, I witnessed, firsthand, the disaster that is After ObamaCare was passed and implemented, small medical practices across the country were faced with new, crippling regulations that threatened their very existence.  I ran a small urology practice in Panama City and faced the very devastation that these new regulations on small business imposed. Thankfully, I was able to work with several other small practices to create the Advanced Urology Institute, a 45-physician practice with over 400 employees and offices throughout north Cooperation and pooling of our resources allowed our practice to reduce costs and to better serve our patients.  My experience underscores why the Small Business Health Fairness Act is so crucial. The Small Business Health Fairness Act allows small businesses to operate under the same principle when purchasing health insurance for their employees.  By joining together across State lines through associations, small businesses can achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by big businesses and unions when purchasing health care. It will empower small businesses to purchase better plans at a lower cost, which means working families can get the care they need at a price they can afford.  It is time to put small business employees on a level playing field with those of large businesses and those in unions. The health insurance market and this bill does just that.

1949,topic-id,4044,"Mr.President, last Friday, I went to Rockford, IL, and had a roundtable discussion about healthcare. There is a lot of debate about healthcare in the Congress and certainly in What I have tried to do is to take this issue home and ask the people who actually are responsible for providing healthcare, and the people I represent, what they think about the new Republican alternative to the Affordable Care What I found is that with virtually no exceptions, they are all gravely concerned that the changes that are going to be made to the healthcare system in America, which represents a dramatic portion of our economy, could have a very negative impact on the real lives of people across my State and across the  Hospital administrators were there to talk about this issue. Swedish Covenant is one of the hospitals well known and respected in the area; OSF as well, and the administrators of both of these hospitals talked about the negative impacts of cutting back Medicaid coverage.  What the Republicans are suggesting in their proposal is that the expansion of Medicaid to provide health insurance for low-income Americans would continue until 2020 and then be cut off, and, they would argue, we will make it more cost efficient. We will let the Governors come up with alternatives. Well, the Governors aren't very happy with this because they know the cost of healthcare continues to go up and they are fearful that when you try to put this all together, the net result is fewer people covered by  Over 600,000 people, because of ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--in Illinois now have health insurance. Who are they? Well, I met Ray Ray, a big Polish American fellow from Chicago, is a musician, and he has made most of his income during his life doing work as a musician. Ray Romanowski, in his 60s today, has never had health insurance until now. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he qualifies for Medicaid, and because he has Medicaid--he patted his wallet and said: I finally have that card in my wallet where I can walk into a hospital or a clinic and get good treatment.  It is the first time in his life, and he is in his sixties.  Judy is a friend of mine in Southern Illinois, and she works at local motels there--in hospitality--at places where they serve breakfast to you. She gets up early in the morning. She is a hard-working lady. It is the kind of job she has had her entire life, and she never, ever had health insurance--not once. She worked 20, 30, 40 hours a week, sometimes two different jobs, but never with health insurance. Now she has it because of the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness she does because she has been diagnosed with diabetes and she needs that kind of care.  So what happened before, when people like Ray and Judy got sick? Before the Affordable Care Act, they would show up in the hospital, go to the emergency room, and they would get treatment, but they wouldn't be able to pay for it. What happens to those expenses at hospitals, under the old way of doing things? They are passed along. The rest of us pay. Anyone who has health insurance and goes in for treatment, part of it is going to be what your treatment is or for your family; the other part is to make up the difference for charity care, uncompensated care.[[Page S1759]]  Now the Republicans believe they have a new idea: Let's restrict access to Let's restrict the health insurance that is available to people like Ray and Well, they are still going to get sick, and they are still going to come to the hospital, and their costs are going to be passed along to others.  The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a neighbor from the State of Wisconsin, said that it is all about competition and choice. Well, when it came to competition and choice, Ray and Judy didn't have a chance. They just didn't make enough money. But they did get coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and they stand to see that coverage endangered, if not lost, under this new approach.  We also had representatives of the nursing association in These are women and men who are the most respected medical providers. Just take a look and ask whether people have higher respect for doctors or whomever; it is always the nurses, 1, because the nurses are the ones who are there day in and day out, hour after hour, in the hospital rooms with the people we love who desperately need medical care. The nurses are opposed to this Republican replacement plan as well.  The doctors--the American Medical Association and the Illinois State Medical Society--are also opposed to it because they looked at the Republican competition and choice alternative and said that at the end of the day, fewer people will have health insurance and the costs will go up dramatically for some. We had a representative of the American Association of Retired Persons there, and they are especially opposed to it. Why? We had a provision in the Affordable Care Act which said that the disparity in premiums can never be more than 3 to 1. Well, the Republicans decided as part of their replacement to make that 5 to 1. Who is going to pay five times instead of three times the base premium? Seniors, those over the age of 55. The Republicans built this into their proposal, and AARP has come out against it.  The second thing to go is--the Affordable Care Act has really brought some savings to healthcare; we wish there were more. But that savings in healthcare is translated into 10 more years of solvency for Medicare is a lifeline for 40 million or 50 million So we gave it 10 more years of solvency with the changes in the Affordable Care Now we are waiting for a score from the Congressional Budget Office, but the early indications are we are going to lose 4 years of solvency in Medicare because the Republicans want to bring in ``competition and choice.'' It turns out that phrase is not going to be good for the future of Medicare--one of the other reasons the American Association of Retired Persons opposes the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care  This bill will be scored this week by the Congressional Budget It was interesting to watch the Sunday shows and watch the procession of Republicans calling themselves fiscal conservatives who came in and discounted any conclusions from the Congressional Budget  When we wrote the Affordable Care Act, we waited sometimes for weeks for the Congressional Budget Office to give us a score: Is this bill going to add to the deficit or reduce the deficit? We had to wait to find out. Is this bill going to cover more people with health insurance or not? We had to wait to find out. But the Republicans went ahead with their proposal without a Congressional Budget Office score, and what they have done over the weekend is downplay the credibility of an office which Democrats and Republicans have relied on for decades. It shows that they are very concerned. I think they know what they are going to find. They are afraid it is going to add to the deficit and it is going to dramatically reduce health insurance for  There are some who estimate that 10 million to 15 million Americans could lose their health insurance. That is half of all of those in the past 6 years who have gained health insurance. It would also increase out-of-pocket healthcare costs for the average person--the Republican plan would--by $1,500 a year, seniors paying approximately $5,000 more a year because of that 5-to-1 premium change that I mentioned earlier. It would basically end Medicaid as we know it.  The Governors are telling us that this is a bad idea because it would shift the cost onto the families and to the Governors to find ways to save money.  It would shorten the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 4 years.  It would allow insurers to once again charge older people significantly more than younger people for health insurance.  And--Republicans added a little grace note there--they defund Planned Parenthood and cut 12 percent of the funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Here is something my colleagues may not know. Because of family planning efforts in America, in the last 30 years, we are now at the lowest point in teenage pregnancies and the lowest point in unplanned pregnancies. So information and education are paying off to reduce unwanted pregnancies, unplanned pregnancies, and, I might add, the likelihood of abortions. So now, as the Republicans say we are going to defund Planned Parenthood for hundreds of thousands of women, that means stopping their access to the healthcare they trust across So in the name of choice, the Republican plan reduces choices for women when it comes to healthcare by defunding Planned  To top it off, the bill cuts taxes for the very wealthy. Those making over $1 million a year in income get a $50,000 tax cut because of the Republican proposal for this new health insurance approach. If you happen to be in the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans, the average tax cut is nearly $200,000. They just can't help themselves.  We put together a revenue source so that we could dramatically expand health insurance coverage in this We now have the lowest percentage of uninsured Americans in our history, and the Republicans--because they are opposed to it--have said: We are going to cut the taxes that help people pay for their health insurance, and we are going to reduce the options that are available to them. So for Americans, it means less coverage, higher costs.  We will see when it goes to the House of Representatives on the floor. The most conservative Republicans don't like it; certainly the Democrats don't like it. The question is whether Speaker Paul Ryan has enough votes. It has united The Republican approach has united America, in opposition. I don't know of a major health-providing group that supports it--not one; not doctors, not hospitals, not clinics, not Patients' groups all say the same thing about  The American Medical Association said:       We cannot support the [bill] as drafted because of the      expected decline in health insurance coverage and the      potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient      populations.  The American Medical Association goes on to say:       We are concerned with the proposed rollback of the Medicaid      expansion. . . . Medicaid expansion has proven highly      successful in providing coverage for lower income      individuals.       The AMA cannot support provisions that repeal the      Prevention and Public Health Trust Fund . . . and we cannot      support provisions that prevent Americans from choosing to      receive care from physicians and qualified providers . . .      [including] those associated with Planned Parenthood      affiliates.  The American Medical Association is saying to the Republicans that they reject their proposal for healthcare and is warning them not to cut off funding for Planned  What does the American Hospital Association say?       We cannot support the [bill]--  the Republican bill--     in its current form.       In addition to the lack of a CBO score, we have some      additional policy concerns with the proposal.       For example, it appears that the effort to restructure the      Medicaid program will have the effect of making significant      reductions in a program that provides services to our most      vulnerable populations.  That is from the American Hospital They estimate that in our State of Illinois, we could lose up to 90,000 jobs by repealing the Affordable Care Act without a suitable substitute--90,000 jobs in my President Trump made a lot of news when he went to visit one of the manufacturing companies after he was first[[Page S1760]]sworn in and saved a couple hundred jobs. Well, I am glad he saved those jobs. I hope he saves a lot more. But if he is going to eliminate 90,000 jobs in my State--people who work at hospitals, some of the best-paying jobs in downstate communities--for goodness sake, that isn't hiring It isn't really focusing on creating jobs in this country. It is just the opposite.  Here is what the American Nurses Association says about the Republican bill:       [The bill] threatens health care affordability, access, and      delivery for individuals across the nation. . . . [T]he bill      changes Medicaid to a per capita cap funding model,      eliminates the Prevention . . . Fund, restricts millions of      women from access to critical health services, repeals income      based subsidies that millions of people rely on. These      changes in no way will improve care for the American people.  What about the U.Conference of Mayors? Here is what they said:       States will be forced to end coverage and eliminate health      care for low-income seniors, people with disabilities,      children, and working families.       The GOP plan is bad for cities, bad for people who live in      cities and bad for people who provide healthcare in      cities.  It is interesting. We had a representative at a Rockford meeting of the disabled community. They are scared to death of this Republican alternative because these folks many times are in serious need of very expensive healthcare. If they are pushed off into these so-called money-saving insurance plans that really are empty inside and don't provide coverage, it could be devastating to these families. They have been through it over and over.  The American Association of Retired Persons said:       This Republican bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal      sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for      Americans aged 50-64 and put at risk the health care of      millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor      seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term      services and supports.       It could hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years      and diminish Medicare's ability to pay for services in the      future.  I remember when Candidate Donald Trump was telling us he would do nothing to hurt Now the first major piece of legislation that comes up threatens the solvency of  Here is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said:       [We] oppose the . . . bill to repeal the Affordable Care      Act because it would weaken Medicare's solvency . . .      threaten access to Medicaid long-term care benefits, and      require ``near seniors'' to pay more for less health care      coverage. The . . . bill puts seniors and people with      disabilities at significant risk of ending up uninsured or      losing access to needed care.  In my own State, the Illinois Health and Hospital Association says:       [This organization] has serious concerns with the direction      of the [bill]. It would cut coverage for hundreds of      thousands of Illinoisans and impose a cap on . . . federal      Medicaid funding--our state is unable to absorb funding cuts      without impacting healthcare for all patients.  I was surprised last week when the Republican Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, said of the Republican plan: ``My first blush read is Illinois won't do very well under the changes that they're recommending.''  He is very careful not to say things about Federal legislation. This he understands: Cutting back on Medicaid is going to impose a new debt on our State and reduce coverage for hundreds of thousands of people in our  So we said to the Republicans: You want to repeal the Affordable Care Act; you have been dead set on doing this for 6 years. Please come up with an alternative that at least expands the coverage of health insurance and makes it more affordable. They tried, and they failed. But now they are going to push it through as a matter of showing political purity. They don't care that there is not a single group of medical providers in this country who support their plan. They obviously don't care that the American Association of Retired Persons believes this is not good for seniors across the board.  I heard the Director of OMB say: Oh, that group--they are going to end up opposing this and then they are going to ask people to donate. Well, it is true that they live on donations. But they are taking a bold position in saying that the Republican approach is going to hurt seniors across Talk to the disability community, and you will hear exactly the same thing. Talk to the advocates for children.  I am really looking for the first group to stand up and say that this new Republican approach is good for this country or good for people when it comes to the cost or availability of health insurance, and I haven't found it yet. I don't know what they are waiting on, but they can't produce it.  What we are looking for is just the opposite. If you will take repeal of the Affordable Care Act off the table, I will pull up a chair. It is not perfect, it can be improved, and I am ready to sit down and do it on a bipartisan basis. But it is ``our way or the highway'' when it comes to the Republican majority on this bill. I hope we can do better. I think the American people expect us to do better.  At the end of the day, they want a better healthcare system, not one that is worse--not one that supposedly gives them ``competition and choice,'' yet they have less coverage in their insurance policies and end up paying more for it.           Calling for an Independent, Bipartisan Commission  Mr.President, I have been coming to the floor recently to discuss the Russian involvement in our last Presidential election. Remember that 2 months ago, some 14 different intelligence agencies all came to the same conclusion--that Vladimir Putin and the Russians were trying to impact the outcome of the Presidential election.  The intelligence reports, which were unclassified and available to the public, said expressly that the Russian intent was to defeat Hillary Clinton and to elect Donald I quickly add, this was not a report from the Democratic National Committee; it was a report from our intelligence agencies. They went through all the efforts taken by the Republicans when they were hacking into computers and releasing information during the course of the campaign.  I think this is serious business. It is the first time I know of that a foreign power has tried to influence the outcome of an American Presidential election. People in Eastern Europe and people in many parts of this world are used to the Russians getting involved in their campaigns, trying to run their favorite candidates and elect them. We shouldn't have to put up with that in the United States of America, so many of us have called for a real investigation of what the Russians were up to.  I think we ought to have a bipartisan commission--an independent, transparent commission to look into the involvement of the Russians; otherwise, we are sitting ducks for them to try it again 2 years from now, in the next election. We know--and this is public information--there were at least 1,000 people sitting at computers in Moscow, trying to hack into America to try to find enough information that they could release to influence the outcome of the election. They are not going to quit. They are going to continue to do this. The question is, What will we do about it?  We have already seen the National Security Advisor to the President, General Flynn, resign when he misled the American people and Vice President Pence about conversations he had with the Just 2 weeks ago, we saw that the Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from investigations involving Russia in the campaign because of conversations he had had, which he didn't disclose before the Senate Judiciary  Almost every week there are more disturbing revelations emerging--not by any honest or open disclosure, mind you, but about the curious alliance among President Trump and the inner circle and Vladimir Putin, if there were one. Key figures, such as the National Security Advisor I mentioned and the current Attorney General, were caught not disclosing communications with the Allied intelligence reportedly confirms that members of the Trump campaign had repeated communications with those thought to be in Russian intelligence. Close Trump associate Roger Stone appeared to have advance knowledge of when Russian-hacked information of Hillary Clinton was going to be released by WikiLeaks, something he presumably could have known only if he was at least discussing it with the Russian hackers.  All the while, the administration has been saying nothing about Putin's actions, about this attack on the United[[Page S1761]]States, or about Russia's ongoing cyber and military aggression in In fact, instead of addressing and responding to this Russian attack head-on, the President has incredibly been parroting Russian strategic interests instead.  Let me repeat that from my largely silent Republican colleagues--and there have been a few exceptions, but most of them will not come to the floor to even discuss this matter. The American President, the same party of Ronald Reagan, has failed to acknowledge this major attack on our Nation and has refused to take action in response. How is this possible? Why is the majority party so silent in the face of these major national security issues?  There is a simple way to resolve these questions:  First, President Trump should do what every Presidential candidate has done in modern history and disclose his tax returns. Why won't he do that? What is in there that is so worrisome to him that he has defied all requests from media and from others across this Nation for him to do exactly what every other Presidential candidate has done?  The President should also be totally cooperative with any investigation about campaign contacts, including by his former campaign manager Paul Manafort; Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor; and his former foreign policy adviser, Carter How do we explain repeated reports of these contacts between that campaign and Russian intelligence?  The administration also needs to answer questions about Roger Stone's comments that suggest he had knowledge of WikiLeaks having and using, in strategically timed releases around periods when the campaign was struggling, the information that had been hacked by the  Tell us why the administration has criticized hundreds by Twitter when there is any perceived slight--from entire States to Major League Baseball to United Steelworkers--but not the Communist KGB agent who conducted an attack on our Nation and democracy.  We need to know why they not only repeatedly denied intelligence information about Russian attacks but, in fact, in July of last year encouraged Russia to hack into their opponent's campaign.  All of these things are being watched closely by nations around the world. Several weeks ago, I went over to Poland, Lithuania, and One of the Polish leaders said to me: We're watching. If you don't take the Russian invasion of your Presidential election seriously, how will you take the Russian invasion of our country seriously? It is a legitimate question because the Russians are up to a strategy that we have seen over and over again. This time, the Americans were the victims.  We need full cooperation by the White We need an independent commission. I have suggested we pick people who are beyond reproach, people we can trust. I mentioned General Colin Powell, a man who served our country so honorably in the military, then served in the Republican White House, and then served as a Republican Secretary of I would accept Colin Powell as the head of a commission to get to the bottom of this because it is a national security issue, which he has undoubtedly had some background in dealing with in years gone by.  There are many good people to turn to, but until we get the straight answers, we can expect the Russians to continue to try to find ways to invade our political process.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

I received them today, prepared by his staff.

He further recommitted to the promise he made at his hearing that he ``would `absolutely not' comply with an order that violates the law, including an order to restart a program with techniques that violated the limitations in the Army Field Manual.''

2001,topic-id,494,"Mr.Speaker, the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is about keeping promises and being worthy of the American people's trust.  We, for the third time in American history, have unified Republican control of the government: a Republican in the White House and Republican control of the House of Representatives and of the In the last five campaigns, one out of every four ads was about health care, so it is our turn to lead.  Here is what we know: ObamaCare today is failing. It is failing to meet the promises that were made that people could keep their doctor or keep their plan. It is failing to be affordable for those who see rising premiums, rising deductibles, no choices, no health care at all, and limited access.  As Republicans leading in this Chamber, we are on a rescue mission to save the American people from this disaster and to replace this law with something that works and gets us away from government-centered health care and moves us to patient-centered health care, doctor-centered health care.  You know, we believe in ownership societies where you ought to be able to own your own healthcare plan, own your own decisions about education and how you choose to prosper.  Today, the Rules Committee is contemplating amendments that should excite conservatives with generational changes that will unlock the potential of this great country.  State flexibility, for the first time, we really see the option for States like mine in Florida to step up and say we don't want the Federal Government involved in health care anymore. We want to take control over those who are vulnerable in our communities, and we want to innovate and come up with solutions that meet those challenges.  Work requirements, hardworking people in my district don't understand why they go to work every day but too often they are paying for entitlements for people who are able-bodied, childless, can work, and choose not to. That is wrong.  We are going to take up, on this floor, legislation that I suspect will have a work requirement for able-bodied, childless adults for those States who choose to implement this bold conservative reform.  We also expect that there will be an end to the disaster of Medicaid expansion. Today in America, one out of every four people is on That is absolutely unsustainable. It means three of us have got to pay for the cost of our own health care and then a substantial portion of the cost of someone else's.  By ending Medicaid expansion for nonexpansion States, we put the country back on a path to prosperity--not government-centered health care, individual patient-centered health care where people can choose the plans that best meet their needs.  If we do this, if we meet this challenge with our historic opportunity to lead, then the American people will know that we are worthy of their trust. We are keeping our word, and we will repeal and replace health care.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2298-3.txt,99999999999999,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,22.0,February
1803,topic-id,2651,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his remarks on Judge I look forward to this debate this week as we work to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court in a bipartisan fashion.  This evening, though, I come to the floor to talk about another very important issue that is happening in this country this week; that is, the U.S.-China relationship that will be highlighted this week as President Trump prepares to meet with President Xi for the first time later this week.  This summer presents a tremendous opportunity for President Trump to expressly state our hope for the relationship, while also elucidating the valid concerns and questions we have about[[Page S2170]]some of China's policies and its future directions.  I am also leading a bipartisan letter with Senator Schatz, and I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing our thoughts about this important relationship.  The U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world. We must get it right. Beijing must also get it right. So today I will address what I hope President Trump will focus on in his conversation with President Xi and also outline a legislative initiative that I am leading in Congress to strengthen our policies in the Asia-Pacific region.  I believe the most urgent challenge between our two nations is the coming nuclear crisis on the North Korean Last year alone, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and a staggering 24 ballistic missile launches. Kim Jong Un is committed to developing his nuclear missile program with one goal in mind--to have a reliable capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to Seoul, Tokyo, and, most importantly, to the continental United  President Trump has said that the United States will not allow that to happen. I am encouraged by the President's resolve. However, the road to stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies through Beijing is the reason the regime acts so boldly and with relative few consequences.  China is the only country that holds the diplomatic and economic leverage necessary to put the real squeeze on the North Korean regime. So while the United States argues over strategic patience or measured resolve, China must go beyond mere articulation of concern and lay out a transparent path forward on how they will work to denuclearize North  For our part, President Trump must lay out a simple calculus for President Xi: The United States will deploy every economic, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military tool at our disposal to deter Pyongyang and to protect our allies. China has a responsibility globally to do the same. As part of our toolbox, the administration should tell China it will now significantly ramp up the sanctions track. Last Congress, I led the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0.  This legislation was the first stand-alone legislation in Congress regarding North Korea to impose mandatory sanctions on the regime's proliferation activities, human rights violations, and malicious cyber behavior. The administration must fully enforce this legislation, including imposing secondary sanctions on any Chinese entities that are aiding  In addition, China must faithfully implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions with regard to North Korea, particularly resolutions 2270 and 2321, negotiated last year, which require China to drastically reduce coal imports from North China's record in this has been lackluster so far. China should stop being complicit in the labor abuses of Pyongyang and shut off avenues of cyber attack, as well, that are being perpetrated by North Korea through Chinese channels.  Two weeks ago, China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, called on the United States and South Korea to halt their annual joint military exercises in exchange for North Korea's suspending its missile and nuclear activities, a deal that the Trump administration rightfully rejected. We should let Beijing know that the United States will not negotiate with Pyongyang at the expense of the security of our allies.  Moreover, before any talks, we must demand that Pyongyang first meet the denuclearization commitments it had already agreed to and subsequently chose to discard. President Trump should unequivocally condemn the economic pressure exerted by Beijing on Seoul over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, on South Korean territory. THAAD is a defensive system that in no way threatens China, and Beijing knows this.  Most importantly, President Trump should indicate to President Xi that a denuclearized Korean Peninsula is in both nation's interests. But to achieve this goal, Beijing must be made to choose whether it wants to work with the United States as a responsible leader to stop the madman in Pyongyang or bear and acknowledge the consequences of keeping him in power.  Another looming crisis in U.S.-China relations is the escalation of tension in the East and South China China's recent destabilizing activities and actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea are contrary to international law, pose an increased risk of future conflict, and necessitate a strong U.and regional response.  Their actions seem at odds with their words. China has declared an illegitimate air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, has dramatically expanded its land reclamation activities in the South China Sea, and has clearly added a military element to it. Since 2013, according to the Department of Defense, China has reclaimed over 3,200 acres of artificial features in the South China  On July 12, 2016, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China violated the sovereignty of the Philippines with regard to maritime disputes between the two nations. Since 2015, China has also built facilities with potential military uses on the artificial islands, including three airstrips--two more than 10,000-feet long, and one nearly 9,000-feet long--hangers that can shelter jet fighters, harbors, anti-aircraft batteries, radars, and structures that could house surface-to-air missiles.  This last week, the Center for Strategic and International Studies Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported that major construction of military dual-use infrastructure on the ``Big 3''--Subi, Mischief, and Fiery Cross Reefs--is wrapping up, with naval, air, radar, and defensive facilities largely complete.  Beijing can now deploy military assets, according to AMTI, including combat aircraft and mobile missile launchers to the Spratly Islands at any time.  The United States must have consistent and assertive diplomatic engagement with China to reinforce that these rogue activities fall outside of accepted international norms. The U.defense posture in this region should remain exactly what Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 30, 2015. I quote Secretary Carter:       The United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever      international law allows, as U.forces do all over the      world. America, alongside its allies and partners in the      regional architecture, will not be deterred from exercising      these rights--the rights of all nations.  A consistent, deliberate, and assertive policy to do just that is imperative for the United During the upcoming summit, I hope that President Trump can set an agenda for positive economic engagement with China and recognize that this is a two-way street. As the top two economies in the world, our nations are inextricably linked, and we must continue to build a trade partnership that benefits the United States, our companies, and U.exporters. However, this engagement also means ensuring that China plays fair.  First and foremost, China must stop its state-sponsored and state-endorsed theft of foreign intellectual property. According to a report by the Intellectual Property Commission, chaired by ADM Dennis Blair, the former U.Commander of the Pacific Command, and John Huntsman, the former Ambassador to China, the theft of U.intellectual property is estimated at over $300 billion annually, and China accounts for about 50 to 80 percent of that amount.  China must understand that this behavior with regard to the massive and well documented theft of foreign intellectual property is unacceptable and antithetical to international norms. China also needs significant improvement to its legal system and to further open its economy to foreign and private investment.  China must understand that new regulations that seek to discriminate against American companies, anti-market policies that favor state-owned enterprises, lack of transparency, and other policies that create an uneven playing field for the United States and our enterprises in China are not acceptable, and that those protectionist behaviors will only further isolate China or hurt their global competitiveness, if they are adopted globally, as they seek to engage further in the world's economy.[[Page S2171]]  While many American firms still look to China as a top priority to grow and succeed in the global marketplace, without tangible economic and legal reforms within China, I fear that these opportunities will be more limited in the future and seriously jeopardize the bilateral commercial relations between our two nations. But if Beijing changes course, the upside of these reforms for China and the United States can be enormous.  A pillar of any nation that seeks a prosperous future and a future with a strong relationship with the United States must be international freedoms. As President Kennedy once stated: ``The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.''  President Trump should heed President Kennedy's wise words and raise China's deplorable human rights record with President Chinese authorities are intensifying human rights abuses and cracking down on civil society. According to the State Department's 2015 Human Rights Report on China: ``Repression and coercion markedly increased during the year against organizations and individuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy and public interest and ethnic minority issues.''  According to the State Department's 2015 International Religious Freedom Report on China: ``Over this past year, there continued to be reports that the government physically abused, detained, arrested, tortured, sentenced to prison, or harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their beliefs and practices.''  We simply cannot and will not accept this type of behavior from a nation that wants to be thought of as a genuine global partner of the United I believe that China's rise can only be peaceful and balanced with a vigorous U.presence in the Asia-Pacific region that is able to check Beijing's worst impulses.  Last May, while attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, I heard a tremendous amount of concern from the region's top leaders about U.presence in the Asia-Pacific region and our commitment to remaining engaged in this critical part of the world. The Trump administration is inheriting a flawed Asia rebalance policy from the previous administration, which was right in rhetoric but ultimately came up short in meaningful action. The new administration and the new Congress ushers in a new era of opportunities with regard to U.policy toward the Asia  But despite the political changes in Washington, U.policy imperatives will remain the same. The Asia-Pacific region has been and will be crucial and critical to U.economic and national security interests for generations to come. By 2050, experts estimate that Asia will account for over half of the global population and half of the world's gross domestic product.  We cannot ignore the fundamental fact that this region is critical for the U.economy to grow and to create jobs through export opportunities. Last week, I held a committee hearing with Ambassador Bob Gallucci, former Ambassador to South Korea, and Congressman Randy Forbes, from Virginia, who was the chairman of some key committees as they dealt with Asia and our naval forces.  In Congressman Forbes' testimony, he also expressed the importance of this region, the Asia Pacific, in these terms: In the coming decades, this is the region where the largest armies in the world will camp. This is the region where the most powerful navies in the world will gather. This is the region where over one-half of the world's commerce will take place and two-thirds will travel. This is the region where a maritime superhighway--transporting good or bad things--linking the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, Northeast Asia, and the United States begins. This is the region where five of America's seven defense treaties are located. This is the region where two superpowers will compete to determine which world order will prevail. This is the region where the seeds of conflict that could most engulf the world will probably be planted.  This is why I am pursuing legislation called the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, ARIA, a new approach that will put American interests first by reassuring our allies, deterring our adversaries, and securing U.leadership in the region for future generations.  The ARIA will pursue three broad goals.  First, it will strengthen U.security commitments to our allies and build partner capacity in the Asia Pacific to deter aggression, project power, and combat terrorism. To do so, the ARIA legislation will authorize funds to bolster U.military presence in the region, grow partner nation maritime capabilities to deter aggression in their territorial waters, and build new counterterrorism partner programs in Southeast Asia to combat the growing presence of ISIS and other terrorist organizations.  ARIA will also enshrine a policy of regularly enforcing U.freedom of navigation and overflight rights in the East and South China  We will reaffirm our longstanding treaty alliances with Australia, South Korea, and Japan, and call for building new regional security partnerships. We will unequivocally back our ally Taiwan, including authorizing new arms sales and providing for enhanced diplomatic contacts with  Second, ARIA will promote diplomatic engagement and securing U.market access in the Asia Pacific region as essential elements for the future growth of the U.economy and success of American businesses. To do so, ARIA will also require that the Trump administration find new and innovative ways to economically engage the region. We will require the U.Government to enhance our trade facilitation efforts and increase opportunities for U.businesses to find new export markets in the Asia U.S.-made exports to Asia will mean more good-paying American jobs at home, which is a great situation for this country.

I am also holding a series of hearings in my subcommittee, the first of which took place last week.  I look forward to working with the Congress and all of our colleagues as we work to advance this initiative. I welcome the input of my colleagues as well.  There is no doubt that the rise of China over the last 30-plus years has been remarkable. China has lifted 500 million people from poverty since Premier Deng Xiaoping began his economic reforms in 1979, and it is now the second largest economy in the world. In that time, our relationship with China has emerged as perhaps the world's most important bilateral relationship, both from an economic and security perspective.  I believe that a mature, productive, and peaceful relationship with Beijing is in the national security and economic interests of the United For both nations, the importance of this relationship can make a significant difference for the world.  While the United States can and should seek to engage China, we must do so with a clear vision of what we want from Beijing, not just over the next 4 years but also over the next 40 years. So it is my sincere hope that President Trump leads with this sense of strategy and purpose when he meets President Xi later this week.

2037,topic-id,1493,"Mr.President, affirming the public's right to know how their government is run, Sunshine Week is an annual reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. In the spirit of government transparency, I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2017. This important piece of legislation furthers the public's access to court proceedings by permitting Federal judges at all Federal court levels to open their courtrooms to television cameras and radio broadcasts.  For decades, and with great results, States such as my home State of Iowa have allowed cameras in their courtrooms. In fact, all 50 States and the District of Columbia now allow some news coverage of proceedings, and it is time we join them. This openness in our courts improves the public's understanding of the legal system and what happens inside our courts.  However, our Federal judicial system unnecessarily remains a mystery to many across the country. The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Klobuchar and a number of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, will greatly improve public access to Federal courts by letting Federal judges open their courtrooms to television cameras and other forms of electronic media. Letting the Sun shine in on our Federal courtrooms will allow Americans to better understand the judicial process.  The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act will ensure that the introduction of cameras and other broadcasting devices into courtrooms goes as smoothly as it has at the State level. This legislation leaves the presence of the cameras in Federal trial and appellate courts to the sole discretion of the judges--it is not mandatory. The bill also provides a mechanism for Congress to study the effects of this legislation on our judiciary before making this change permanent through a 3-year sunset provision. The bill protects the privacy and safety of nonparty witnesses by giving them the right to have their faces and voices obscured. Additionally, the bill prohibits the televising of jurors and includes a provision to protect the due process rights of each party.  It is time to open the courthouse doors and let the light shine in on the Federal judiciary. Granting the public greater access to an already public proceeding will inspire greater faith in and appreciation for our judges who pledge equal and impartial justice for all.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 643       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(iii) Exception.--The presiding judge shall not permit any      action under this subparagraph--       (I) if that judge determines the action would constitute a      violation of the due process rights of any party; and       (II) until the Judicial Conference of the United States      promulgates mandatory guidelines under paragraph (5).       (B) No media coverage of jurors.--The presiding judge shall      not permit the photographing, electronic recording,      broadcasting, or televising of any juror in a trial      proceeding, or of the jury selection process.       (C) Discretion of the judge.--The presiding judge shall      have the discretion to obscure the face and voice of an      individual, if good cause is shown that the photographing,      electronic recording, broadcasting, or televising of the      individual would threaten--       (i) the safety of the individual;       (ii) the security of the court;       (iii) the integrity of future or ongoing law enforcement      operations; or       (iv) the interest of justice.

1837,topic-id,1182,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague Senator Wyden for leading this important discussion. I joined the Senate Intelligence Committee 4 years ago, just a few short months before the public release of thousands of classified documents forced our country to have a debate over the scope and reach of America's surveillance programs, especially as they relate to American citizens.  That debate has formed the backdrop for national security policy decisions ever since, and I am very proud of the positive steps we have made toward reclaiming our civil liberties while still giving our intelligence and law enforcement communities the tools they need and deserve to anticipate threats, track down terrorists, and keep this Nation safe. It is because of Congressman Pompeo's opposition to those important reforms that I rise today to oppose his nomination to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Congressman Pompeo has a long legislative and rhetorical history on surveillance, on torture, and on other issues that I believe we simply cannot overlook in considering his nomination.  In our conversations, in answers to written questions, and during his confirmation hearing, Congressman Pompeo has often said the right thing or tried to give answers that on their face give the impression that he has changed his positions on these issues. But we need to carefully review the Congressman's votes and public statements to be sure that he understands the importance of protecting Americans' constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties and meeting the needs of our national security at the same time.  I was proud to help lead the effort to pass the USA FREEDOM Act in 2015 to finally end the government's overreach, their dragnet collection of law-abiding Americans' personal information, and provide the intelligence community with an updated legal framework that ensures they have the tools they need to focus on the records of actual terrorists, while at the same time protecting the privacy of innocent  Although the Congressman voted to support the USA FREEDOM Act in 2015, within a year, he had backtracked, writing a column for the National Review that stated:       Those who today suggest that the USA FREEDOM Act, which      gutted the National Security Agency's (NSA) metadata program,      enables the intelligence community to better prevent and      investigate threats against the U.are lying. I use that      word intentionally.  A few weeks later, Congressman Pompeo in the Wall Street Journal wrote: ``Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information in a comprehensive, searchable database.''  I think I should read that one more time: ``Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information in a comprehensive, searchable data base.''  I think we should unpack that sentence a little bit. First, when asked by Senator Wyden and me to clarify what metadata he believes should be collected, Congressman Pompeo made clear that he was referring to a rollback of the USA FREEDOM Act and a return to the warrantless and unnecessary collection of billions of communication records for millions of innocent Americans not suspected of any crime.  Shortly after Congressman Pompeo's Wall Street Journal column was published, the NSA's general counsel wrote in a column in Lawfare: ``Largely overlooked in the debate that has ensued . . . is the fact that under the new arrangement''--meaning the USA FREEDOM Act--``our national security professionals will have access to a greater volume of call records subject to query in a way that is consistent with our regard for civil liberties.''  But, really, it is the second part of Congressman Pompeo's position that gives me far more concern. What exactly does he mean by calling for the collection of ``publicly available financial and lifestyle information'' and placing it into a ``comprehensive, searchable data base''? When asked to clarify his proposal, Congressman Pompeo declined. However, I think it is clear from the context of both his columns and his public statements that he believes the U.Government ought to be collecting dramatically more private information from innocent Americans who are not under investigation for a crime.  Let me be clear. The Federal Government has no business collecting ``lifestyle information'' on its own citizens, and innocent Americans should expect that their private financial data is just that--private. This flies in the face of the Fourth  On torture, Congressman Pompeo's record is also clear: He has supported it. Congressman Pompeo thinks it was a mistake to stop the enhanced interrogation program. He issued a very personal attack against then-Committee Chairman Feinstein when the committee released its report on the CIA detention and interrogation program. And while he acknowledges that CIA interrogation techniques are currently limited to those contained in the Army Field Manual, Congressman Pompeo said to our committee that he will ``consult with experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the U.government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army Field Manual is needed.''  One could easily infer that the Congressman would ask the CIA officers who participated in the detention and interrogation program whether they believe the techniques contained in the Army Field Manual are sufficient. If he is told they are not, he has certainly left open the option of literally rewriting the Army Field This is problematic for a number of reasons and should be of deep concern to my colleagues.  Finally, the day before his nomination was announced, Congressman Pompeo tweeted that he was looking forward to ``rolling back'' the Iran nuclear agreement, which ended each and every pathway for Iran to develop a weaponized nuclear device, including a covert path. When I asked him about this in our hearing, Congressman Pompeo said: ``That communication was approved before I was aware that I was going to be the nominee to the Central Intelligence Agency.'' The Congressman went on to say that in his view, the Iran nuclear agreement was a ``mistake for American national security,'' but as CIA Director, he would ``work to make sure it is fully implemented and will endeavor to provide straight information'' about the progress being made in reducing Iran's nuclear capability. However, given his deep antipathy toward the Iran agreement, I have serious concerns about his ability to be objective about this issue, which is critical to the stability of the entire Middle East and to our efforts to ensure that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.  Having said all of this, if the Congressman is confirmed, I hope he will fulfill one of the commitments he made to me: to improve the communications and relationship between the oversight committees in Congress and the Agency itself. It is my hope that a CIA Director coming from outside the Agency will give greater weight to informing the Intelligence Committee of the CIA's activities than his immediate predecessor has. Congressman Pompeo, if confirmed, will have an opportunity to recalibrate this relationship, and, if given the chance, I hope he seizes that opportunity.  Thank you.

2048,topic-id,874,"I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership to set aside for us to visit with the American people andtalk about empowering patients, not politicians.  For 6 years, we have witnessed the failed rollout of the ObamaCare program. We didn't get to keep our plan that we liked,and we didn't get to keep our doctor that we had such a good relationship with. We have seen physicians leave the business. Wehave spent billions on duplicative, unnecessary exchanges that are now failing across this country. So I commend the RepublicanStudy Committee, and I am proud to be a part of this group to talk about how to bring relief to the American people on thefailed ObamaCare law.  I still hear from constituents--even now, 6 years later, from this rolling evolution of ObamaCare--who have seen theircoverage lost and their increases in healthcare costs skyrocket. This healthcare regulatory burden that we are talking abouttonight has led to droves of part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs and unaffordable group plans for the people who were in agood small business group plan. This regulatory burden is on top of what has been a 6-year to 8-year crushing burden on businessfrom many different agencies from the EPA and beyond.  One constituent wrote my office after he was forced to accept an insurance plan to meet the affordable healthcare law thatcost him $1,300 a month, Mr.Speaker, and he still has to meet two $2,500 deductibles before the insurance coverage kicks in.Now, that is $20,600 a year. Mr.Speaker, I was a small businessman before I joined Congress, and we had employees that made$20,600 a year in our small business. So what is left for the family budget when you are going to spend $20,000 for health care?That is typical now after the rollout of ObamaCare for a family of four. This is in a place in our country where healthcarecosts $20- or $30,000 a year in out-of-pocket expenses? Obviously, this system is broken.  Now, in Arkansas, unlike much of the country where people are definitely seeing large, double-digit, or, in some cases,larger increases in the ObamaCare premium, Arkansans, on the exchanges, are seeing lower than those average increases. In myview, this is largely because our Governor and our State legislature are working hard to make the best out of a bad situationand fighting to pursue innovative measures that work best for our small  The Arkansas Works program has helped to prevent skyrocketing premiums on the exchanges, and the State is still subject,though, to duplicative reviews by Federal and State agencies and costly and burdensome regulations that have nothing to do withtrying to lower the cost of health care for  This week, Governor Hutchinson wrote the House leadership decrying the individual and employer mandates and stressing theneed for healthcare reform that provides our States more flexibility--more flexibility, Mr.Speaker--todesign programs that fit the needs of people in our State while increasing predictability and affordability. Some of the pointsGovernor Hutchinson made in his letter to our leadership include calling for States having the option of receiving Medicaidfunds through a block grant enabling them to tailor the program in the Medicaid population under health care in what fitsArkansas, what Arkansans can afford. In fact, that is our Better Way approach, Mr.Speaker, for the Medicaid population.  He calls for the elimination of the Federal health insurance exchanges. We had exchanges before ObamaCare that can beoperated by States in the private sector without Federal interference. Governor Hutchinson called for restricting theduplicative reviews of rate and plan filings by They are already being done by our individual State insurance regulators.Of course, the thing that drives up costs not only for the Medicaid population, for people on the ObamaCare exchanges, and forpeople out in the group health plans is the essential health benefits requirement.  Governor Hutchinson says that this has driven up costs for everybody, for government, for families, and that elimination ofthese requirements would provide flexible options for insurance providers to offer cheaper plans to younger and healthierindividuals. That is key to choice, Mr. In some counties, Arkansans now only have one insurance option. I don't think one option is an option. There is no choice.This monopoly or oligopoly pricing combined with the mandates are demonstrating the unaffordability of the Affordable Care  With the recent election, we now have a unique opportunity to recognize these flaws of this one-size-fits-all, BigGovernment-mandated, top-down approach to health care, reverse course, and, again, bring relief to the American people of thisfailed law put forth by the Obama administration.

Finally, H.1367, sponsored by Representative Brad Wenstrup, which enhances the VA's ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees.

1985,topic-id,1804,"Mr.Speaker, on a less happy collegial note, it comes as no surprise to the majority leader at the height of our displeasure and disappointment as it relates to what is going on, back to the consideration of the reconciliation process for the repeal or modification of the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care The bill was posted this Monday, this past Monday night, it was marked up on Wednesday, there were no hearings, there were no opportunities for witnesses to come forward. And as the gentleman knows, he is absolutely correct, I like these quotes, but I like these quotes because they point out theoretically what I would have great agreement with in terms of process.  Particularly, I call your attention to a quote of Speaker Paul Ryan: ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that lacks a key ingredient: the full participation of you, the American people.''  That quote was July 19, 2009. That quote was referring to the process involved in the adoption of the Affordable Care  As the gentleman knows, the Affordable Care Act had 79 hearings. As the gentleman knows, there were 181 witnesses who testified about the Affordable Care As the gentleman knows, that process took approximately 1\1/2\ years, 8 months of which was waiting to see whether Senator Grassley would participate in a bipartisan way in forging healthcare reform in this country.  The gentleman is well aware, not only have we had literally hundreds of thousands of people around the country come to townhall meetings, many that his Members have held, and express their deep concern about the loss of healthcare security if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. So there is no doubt that the American public--I am not saying it is 100 percent--but a large number of the American public are very concerned.  The gentleman further knows, I am sure, because I am sure he has seen the letters, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association,[[Page H2042]]even the Consumers Union, and hundreds of other groups representing providers, patients, even insurance companies, have expressed deep, deep concern about the adverse consequences of the passage of the American Health Care Act that was marked up in the dead of night. We were criticized. The gentleman apparently doesn't agree with that. But the facts are the facts. They are not alternative facts.  You started marking them up on Wednesday morning, there was some delay during the day, as you know, because we were very concerned about how fast you were moving that. Less than 48 hours after it was introduced, it was marked up. No hearings, no witnesses, no ability to read the bill.  As a matter of fact, shockingly, Mr.Brady voted against an amendment which said: Read the bill. Now, what was shocking about that is that was Mr.Brady's amendment that he offered back in 2010. He voted against the amendment that said: Read the bill. I don't think anybody really had much opportunity to read the bill before it was marked up.  Greg Walden, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said also, in July of 2009:       On a bill of this significance, you would think that we      would at least allow people to come in who are affected by      the extraordinary changes in this bill and have a chance to      let us know how it affects them.  That was Greg Walden, now the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, July 9, 2009. He is now in charge of that committee. Not a single witness testified on the bill that was marked up in his committee. And it was marked up through the dead of the night, if we want to parse our words, because it started in the morning of But it didn't end until the morning, 26 hours later, on Which meant that Mr.Walden kept his members in their seats marking up a bill, except when they were voting coming over here, for 26 hours straight on one of the most consequential bills this House will consider and that the Senate will consider, affecting, as I said, millions and millions and millions of people.  Now, I understand the Budget Committee is scheduled to mark that bill up on Wednesday, just a week later. Again, I don't know whether there are going to be hearings and if those hearings will be open to the witnesses that should be called to testify on a bill of such impact.  Let me do one additional quote, because the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee had an interesting quote as well. He said: ``The Democratic Congress and White House simply aren't listening. Democrats are ramming it through over the public's objections.''  That was on March 17, 2010, some year after the bill had been introduced. Thousands of meetings had been held by Republicans and Democrats around the country on the bill. And, as I said, 79 hearings and 181 witnesses later. That is what Chairman Brady said.  And, of course, Chairman Brady, in less than 48 hours, had a markup. Now, he did not have quite as long a markup. It ended at 4:30 a.m. Thursday morning. So that was the dead of night. Or, if you want to parse words, perhaps, the dead of the early morning. But, nevertheless, most of my public wasn't up watching. I presume even at 4:30, which would have been 1:30 for your public, they weren't up watching.  So this was done out of the sight of the public and is inconsistent, I suggest to my friend, Mr.Speaker, the majority leader, inconsistent with the pledge of transparency, openness, and those three quotes that I just read you that said the American people should have the opportunity to express their opinion on legislation generally, but certainly on legislation of this consequence.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I always look forward to these discussions. I know they are about the schedule, but I always look forward to what quotes you are going to bring up next.  Let me see if I can answer all of those questions that you raised.  First, my friend did inform me, last week and again today, that the Democrats have held 79 hearings over 2 years on Well, we have spent the last 6 years.  I promised you that I would see how many hearings we had. When I went back and checked, the Republicans have held 113 hearings on the ways to repeal and replace We had expert witnesses on both sides of the aisle on everything from the individual mandate and Medicaid sustainability, to the medical device tax, and ObamaCare's failing co-ops.  We have been committed to repealing and replacing this law for years, and I am sure you will find a lot of quotes from almost everybody on this side of the aisle saying that same thing. We have done the work, we have listened to the American people, and we believe now it is time to act.  You did bring up about the committees. You brought up about reading the bill. So what we put forth is we put a website together for the patient-centered healthcare bill, and it is available online at readthebill.gop. Now, this is only 123 pages. That is a difference from your bill of 2,700 pages for  Now, we remember what the Democrats said when they were passing ObamaCare, that you had to pass the bill to see what is in it. So I went back and checked how many people were unable to visit the website. We had over 350,000 visitors visit our website in just 36 hours, and 100,000 downloaded the legislative text.                              {time}  1145  Now, when you talk about dead of night, I was on this floor, you were on this floor, and I know people on both sides of the aisle have used it before, but the dilatory activity on the other side of the aisle to slow this process down put us into nighttime.  And then let's think about how this process went. It was an open process. Why did it go so long? We debated hours of Democrats' amendments because we weren't going to shut it down. We never called the question. We kept going as long as people wanted to go. And we spent hours on one amendment that just wanted to change it to a hashtag of a different name. That was a Democratic amendment to somehow change the bill. We didn't stop with that. We let everybody talk, and we let everybody have their voice because we believe in regular order.  Yes, we spent 27 hours on it because we were not going to deny anybody the ability to talk or offer their amendment. And that is exactly what we did, and that is what the American people expect to have happen.  So, 113 hearings, I congratulate you on your 79; 123 pages compared to 2,700. I believe this is a great first step in three phases. For too long this health care of ObamaCare has failed.  In that 2,700 pages they created 23 co-ops and provided more than $2 billion. In this short amount of time, 18 of them have collapsed. They had the quote that, if you like your health care, you could keep it, but millions of Americans found out that wasn't true. They said your premiums would go down. Millions of Americans have found out that is not true either.  Now, across this country, one-third of the entire country only has one provider. And the very sad part of this, just within the last month, Humana announced that they are going to pull out. That is leaving 16 counties, and I see my good friends from Tennessee, with no provider at all.  We can do so much better. That is why we spent the years; we spent the hearings; we have had the witnesses.  And I know it is your right to come and ask to adjourn so somehow we couldn't get to the bill, it is your right to continue to ask to adjourn so Members can't offer their amendments, but you know what? If we had to spend through the dead of night and stay up so we made sure, even if it is on the other side of the aisle, a Democrat could offer an amendment, just a hashtag to change the name, that is your right, and we would spend the time and do it. And we spent hours at it.  If you ask me, personally, I didn't think that amendment changed anybody's health care in But you have a right to do it, and we made sure we kept that right, and we had regular order.  I thank the gentleman for his quotes.  ",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2041.txt,566,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,10.0,March
1986,topic-id,1526,"I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr.Speaker, we have had, literally, tens of thousands of hearings that have dealt with almost every issue that this[[Page H2043]]House considers. I suppose I should take from the majority leader's discussion that, if we have had those hearings in previous Congresses, in the last Congress, the Congress before that, the Congress before that, and we have a substantial number of new Members in this House, and we have millions and millions of voters who are counting on this, we will just simply tell them: Read the transcript of 2002 or of 2009 or of 2013. That is not regular order, Mr. Regular order is you introduce a bill. It is referred to a committee, which in turn refers it to a subcommittee, and, even if it keeps it in the bosom of the full committee, it has a hearing. It posts the bill. It tells citizens throughout this country: If you have an interest, come in and tell us what your interest is, what your perspective is, what you think the ramifications of this bill are. The subcommittee marks it up, if it was referred to a subcommittee, then the full committee marks it up, and then it is referred to the floor. That is regular order, Mr. To rationalize a procedure which has a bill introduced Monday night and is subjected to 26 hours, straight, of markup on the following Wednesday, less than 48 hours later, no matter how you dress it up, that is not, Mr.Speaker, regular order.  What it is is trying to jam through a bill before the American public has an opportunity to tell us what they think about the bill. What it is is jamming through a bill and not allowing the providers, the doctors, the patients, the insurance companies, all of the stakeholders, to have an opportunity to read that bill introduced about 72 hours ago now--a little more than that, maybe close to 96.  That, Mr.Speaker, is not regular order. And I will tell my friend for whom I have a great deal of respect, I think he puts the best face on it, but nobody believed the Republicans had a bill, Mr.Speaker, until Monday night. Well, actually, I believed they had a bill at the last colloquy, and I looked for it all over this I couldn't find it. It wasn't posted. The ranking member on the committee didn't have it. No committee Democrat had the bill. They couldn't read it.  So to pretend, Mr.Speaker, that hearings on some other bill at some other time in some other Congress suffices for regular order is something, Mr.Speaker, I cannot agree with. And if the situations were reversed, as I have experienced over the last 36 years, that side of the aisle would have torn this place apart. Why do I think that? Because I have seen it.  Yes, we had some delaying, four motions to adjourn, so that we had some time to figure out what this bill was about and some time to hear from the American people. It certainly wasn't enough time. We are going to be hearing more from the American people, I think, Mr. I appreciate the gentleman trying to say that, well, we only had 48 hours. Sometimes, Mr.Speaker, we do that in a hurry. And the reason is because we are about to go on a break. We are about to go on an August break or a recess or something of that nature. That is not the case. These committees didn't have to meet through the night. They could have met They could have met today. They could meet next week. But this bill is being rushed through too fast with too much adverse consequence to the American people.  I would hope the majority leader would slow this bill down. I hope the Rules Committee has full hearings on this bill and that it does not have just attenuated hearings with few witnesses, because there are a lot of people who want to tell us, their Representatives, what their view is of this bill.  I know the Speaker has said there are going to be three phases to this bill, and the majority leader said so as well, and there will be additional legislation. I hope, Mr.Speaker, that my friend, the majority leader, will urge the committees not to consider additional legislation either in the middle of the night or with no notice and no opportunity for witnesses and no hearings.  Previous hearings will not suffice, Mr.Other Congresses had hearings. This Congress has a responsibility to hear from the American people. That is what Speaker Ryan said; that is what Mr.Brady said; that is what Mr.Walden said. They said it at a time when they were in the minority, but it ought to apply when they are in the majority. And if we are in the majority, it ought to apply to us as well. I hope that happens, Mr.Speaker, for the country's sake, for our people's sake.  I will yield to the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, if he would like to speak.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  Mr.Speaker, I do want to remind people, when you use reconciliation, what is the process? Well, the process states you have the authorizing committee post and they mark up. We did that. Budget Committee marks up. They will do that next week. Rules Committee will meet, then it comes to the House floor.  I will never apologize for having 113 hearings on repealing and replacing I will never apologize for having all the witnesses in.  And I love that you bring a lot of quotes of people inside that are elected, but I will be very frank. The quotes I love and the quotes I care most about are the ones that come from my constituents.  For some reason, this idea that this is a complex issue but you had hearings before so you are going to forget all about those hearings, why do we have committees? Why do you keep Members on your own side of the aisle on the same committees? To build expertise, to solve big problems. So, no, they don't forget what they learned in those hearings.  But let me read you quotes from a few constituents.  ``Dear Kevin, thank you for your diligence in these disruptive political times. I have several concerns.  ``ObamaCare blew us out of the water. I retired early as an RN due to health problems, so I have to pay for my entire health insurance. I am not complaining about that, but I am tired of having premiums go through the roof. I lost my doctor and my plan.  ``In 2017 there were few options without a $5,000 deductible. If I have to pay that much first, then why pay for insurance? Our income is not huge. We cannot afford this.''  Or from another constituent: ``Dear Kevin, I just wanted to convey that I strongly feel legislative action is needed to fix the  ``My family deductible has increased over $3,000 a year--it used to be $1,000 8 years ago--and I practically only have health insurance in case a catastrophic accident were to occur.  ``Also, my sister-in-law can no longer work more than 29 hours a week since her employer does not want to have to provide insurance. That is ridiculous.''  Or: ``Dear Kevin, I just got my 2017 health insurance renewal notice, $650 per month, up 20 percent. I am 60 years old, have worked and saved all my life, so I don't qualify for subsidies. I can't go without insurance, but I can't pay for it either. Something needs to be done. I am so upset that I am crying right now.''  But my friend, Mr.Speaker, on the other side of the aisle says to wait to help these people. Forget about the 113 hearings, even though it is more than the 70-some that ObamaCare had, or 123 pages is too much instead of 2,700.  I will never apologize for having the wisdom to listen and, now, the courage to lead. But I will promise you this, Mr.Speaker, and my friend on the other side of the aisle: I have never come to this floor to offer to adjourn just to disrupt the process.  And, yes, I had Members on our side of the aisle that would get frustrated that Democrats would offer an amendment that just dealt with a hashtag. No, let's let them have their say. If they feel that is important for American health care, to put a hashtag name change, then let's spend hours on it. Because we believe in the process, we will defend your right to have that process even though it will not help one constituent of mine or yours.  But you want to spend your time doing that? We will do that. And we did do that. That is why we worked through the night. But we will not give up on the American people. That is why we are doing what we are doing, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2041.txt,566,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,10.0,January
1987,topic-id,911,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the majority leader. I presume that he has heard from--I don't have the quotes in front of me,[[Page H2044]]but maybe I will bring them next week--the thousands of people who have said their lives have been saved by the Affordable Care Act; the thousands of parents with a child with a preexisting condition that, if the Republicans had succeeded in their 65 votes to repeal it, would not have been protected; the millions of seniors who are paying less for their prescription drugs because of the Affordable Care                              {time}  1200  I could read all those letters.  Why do I read the letters of Mr.Walden, Mr.Brady, and Speaker Ryan?  Because they are in charge.  All our constituents, on either side, had no opportunity to testify on this bill. But Speaker Ryan, Mr.Walden, and Mr.Brady could have given them that opportunity, and they chose not to. They rationalize it apparently because, well, we had hearings in the past.  Does this bill have the subject matter of the ACA?  It does. But this bill was offered just some, as I said, 90-or-so hours ago. And the leader says: Well, that is okay. It is based on all those hearings we had.  The fact is this bill has not been brought forward for the last 7 years while there was a repeal for  Why?  We all know why. Mr.Speaker, it is because the majority could not come to an agreement, and they are not in agreement now. Perhaps, if this bill stands out there a little bit, it is so flawed they won't be able to get the votes on their side of the floor.  I was here--I don't think the majority leader was here--when we adopted the part D prescription drug program. It was called up by the majority, the Republican Party at the evening hour; and we voted from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m. And when I say we voted, that vote was kept open for 3 hours while they opportuned their Members: You have got to vote for this. President Bush wants it. You have got to vote for this.  We voted against it. But the vote was held open 3 hours, I tell my friend. That was not regular order.  Now, our side has held a vote open from time to time--never for 3 hours, but from time to time. That is why it is being rushed. It is not because they had a lot of hearings before, not because witnesses had testified they didn't like the Affordable Care We understand that.  The issue is not whether people like or dislike the Affordable Care It is how are we going to provide what the President has promised: access for everybody to health care at a lower cost and a better price.  I told the majority leader last week--and I repeat my comments, Mr.Speaker, to the majority leader this week--if they bring such a bill to the floor, I will support it. This bill does not do that.  So what President Trump promised during the election and what he promised from that podium just a few days ago is not what this bill represents. It is not what they promised to the American people.  What I asked the majority leader was--they are apparently going to have some additional bills--whether or not they will be also rushed through without hearings on the premise that there were hearings in the past.  I repeat that there are a lot of new Members in this body that didn't have the opportunity to have those hearings and weren't in this body. I don't know how many there are because I don't know how many Congresses we are talking about if we adopted this bill 7 years ago and then there were hearings subsequent.  So I don't know where we are going, Mr.Speaker, but I think the American people expect an opportunity to be heard. Yes, I may quote some next week.  The people who were elected by the American people to do their job have the power to open up the doors and open up the windows and pull back the curtains so that the American people could come in and testify. There were all those witnesses who testified in the last Congress and the Congress before that, but I am talking about the people who testified during a Congress in which we considered the bill. We haven't had an open rule this year, Mr.We have had structured rules. We have had no open rule.  So in terms of the majority leader telling me, Mr.Speaker, that we want everybody to have their opportunity, and he caricatures one amendment that was--I think I would agree with him--more to show that not a single Republican would vote. And Mr.Brady, as I pointed out, didn't vote for his own amendment that he offered when the Affordable Care Act was marked up to say read the bill.  Time was not given to read the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I understand we are not going to come to any conclusion today; but I am hopeful that the process that was perpetrated on not only the minority but also the majority this week will not be repeated, and that the representations that have been made by the Speaker, by the young guns, and by so many others would be a process that is, in fact, open, thoughtful, and democratic.

If 100 years ago we had the industrial revolution, today we have the softwarerevolution, and the forces of automation and globalization are fundamentally changing our economy.  We first must thank the hardworking Americans who helped build this economy--the steelworkers and the coal miners and thosewho were machinists who built the economy that made us an exceptional Nation--that were the foundation of everything that SiliconValley does today. We need to thank them for the extraordinary hard work and grit that they showed.  We also need to recognize that our economy is changing, and not everyone has participated in the technology revolution. Somefolks have benefited, and they are creating jobs and wealth, and others have been left behind. We have an obligation to makesure that every American and their daughters and their sons get to participate in this technology revolution and have technologyjobs.

This would exempt any regulations that affect the safety of our National Airspace  It is important to note that commercial drone operations are only possible because of FAA rules. Last August, the FAA's small UAS rule--unmanned aerial systems rule--opened the door for small businesses to use unmanned systems easily and without cumbersome paperwork.[[Page H1382]]  The current inaction on the ``flights over people'' rule could limit UAS operations, such as news reporting, disaster relief, and public safety from becoming a reality. As a result, many businesses and the country could lose out on the full societal and economic benefits of  Once UAS are fully integrated into the national airspace, the full benefits of these tools will help businesses to expand and our economy to grow--with a projected 100,000 jobs and over $82 billion in economic impact over the next decade. That is why this particular amendment is supported by the UAV Coalition as well as the Automated Vehicles  But we need action from regulatory authorities to fully integrate UAS into our airspace. Without my amendment, the SCRUB Act has the potential to stifle a growing industry and prevent the modernization of air traffic. I want to reiterate: UAS operators need guidance and regulations from the FAA so they can operate safely and without unnecessary paperwork.  I urge the House to support my amendment.

1835,topic-id,1018,"Mr.President, I rise today to support Congressman Mike Pompeo for the He isn't somebody I just met in my office to be able to talk with; he isn't just somebody I served with in the I know him personally. For 6 years, he served on the House Intelligence He struggled through the legal issues of what it means to be in the CIA and also have good oversight, understanding those difficulties that keep America safe but also making sure we protect the privacy rights of  Mike Pompeo was a Harvard law grad at the top of his class. He gets this information. He understands the constitutional implications. He is also a top graduate of West Point, serving in the Army as well. He knows what it means to be able to defend this country. He is one of the most qualified people out there to possibly serve in this role, understanding the legal implications, having 6 years of service on the House Intelligence Committee, understanding the background, what it means to seek real oversight and to be able to struggle through these issues.  He is a person of great integrity, and he is a person who will passionately help protect the He is a person who holds tremendous respect for the people serving in our intelligence community--people who most of us will never, ever meet but work every single day to be able to keep our Nation secure. These are individuals who are also passionate about not only keeping our Nation secure but also maintaining the constitutional protections we have always had as a nation.  I heard a lot of the debate today, and I have been astounded at some of the conversations coming out. Let me just recap a couple of these things that I have heard because it was surprising to me. On the issue of advice and consent from the Senate, it seems that some people have not actually read the written testimony and the questions for the record that Mike Pompeo has put out there or listened to his actual testimony or maybe seen his voting record when he was in the House of For instance, there is this conversation sitting out there about torture--that he is going to somehow promote torture. He has stated over and over again that he would abide by the law and the Army Field That is what every candidate would say on that. That is the actual law. He has been very clear on that; he doesn't promote torture. I don't know what else he would have to say. Yet it continues to come up that somehow the head of the CIA is going to promote torture.  I have also heard that he wants to keep Gitmo open. Well, I would stand in line with him on that one. For those of us who have actually been to Guantanamo Bay and have seen it, it is a modern prison facility. It is not some dog cage out there that is holding people out in the weather. Neither is it a place that is doing torture. Guantanamo Bay is a place where the worst of the worst terrorists are being detained and held for trial. The issue of the past 8 years wasn't just that the Obama administration was working as hard as they could to release as many terrorists as they could from there; it is that they weren't taking them to trial. That is the right action--not to do indefinite detention but to actually work toward trial for these individuals. But in the meantime, they should be held at Guantanamo Bay, which is a modern prison facility, and it is the appropriate spot to be able to hold terrorists offshore.  Then there are all of these conversations about collecting data, as if Mike Pompeo wants to scan through all of our Facebook pages. May I remind everyone that the Central Intelligence Agency is focused on foreign intelligence gathering--outward facing. The FBI is focused on the United States, on what is happening with U.persons. The CIA has strict prohibitions from gathering data on U.persons. The comments he made about gathering any kind of information on social networks and about gathering from what is publicly available is something all of us, I think, should support. If anyone outside the United States--whether they be in Pakistan, whether they be in Syria, or wherever they may be--is on social networks talking about the destruction of the United States, I would assume someone is tracking that, and that someone would be the We would hold the head of the CIA to account, saying: Weren't you tracking this terrorist's Facebook page, at least? Weren't you tracking their Twitter account? So for him to make a public statement that we should gather information on social media, I think all of us would agree, hopefully, that, yes, on foreign terrorists we should gather as much as we can possibly gather from the publicly available information, whatever it may be. Comments about his wanting to expand data collection fly in the face of reality when he voted as a Member of the House of Representatives to limit data collection.  I have no issue supporting Mike He is very experienced, he is very well educated, he is well prepared for the task, and he is passionate about keeping our Nation safe within the bounds of the law. That is what we[[Page S384]]want a CIA Director to do: to passionately go to work to honor our civil liberties. We want to make sure he is standing up for us every single day. In the moments when our Nation is asleep, we want to know the great folks of the CIA are awake and watching because the threats that we face internationally are very real.

1823,topic-id,476,"Tonight, the Senate will vote on the President's nominee to be the Director of the Central Intelligence As I said on Friday, I do not believe the Senate should rush to confirm such a critical position, without the opportunity for debate or discussion. We are having that debate today, and that is why on Friday, I supported a motion to proceed to this nomination.  Our intelligence agencies have an enormous task ahead. The challenges they face range from state-sponsored information warfare to countering violent extremists around the world. Among those who will lead these efforts will be the next Director of the Central Intelligence The importance of the CIA cannot be overstated. Now, perhaps more than ever, we need a Director who will manage the Agency with the full confidence of the American people.  This confidence is based not only on a future Director's ability to comprehend security challenges, but on his or her ability to safeguard the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans and to uphold and advance United States leadership in protecting human rights.  I have serious concerns with President Trump's nominee to lead the Congressman Pompeo has called for the re-establishment of the bulk collection of Americans' phone records, and has even argued that the intelligence community should combine that metadata ``with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database.'' He went on to say that ``[l]egal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.''  But Congress outright rejected the bulk collection of Americans' records when it passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis--the very program that Congressman Pompeo said that he wants to bring back.  During his testimony last week, Congressman Pompeo attempted to diffuse this and other questions about his more alarming positions by affirming his appreciation of the supremacy of law. It sounded to me, like the tried and true confirmation conversion. I appreciate that he testified that he understands the responsibility of a Director to uphold the Constitution and the laws passed by  But I remain deeply concerned that he advocated for such dangerous measures in the first place. And I am concerned that he will push to remove ``legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance''--just as he said last year.  We face grave threats from around the world, whether from Russia, from ISIS, or other adversaries. The Director of the CIA must be trusted by all Americans to protect us from these threats, but also to protect our nation's core values.  I don't question Congressman Pompeo's loyalty to our nation. I do question his stated beliefs that immediate security concerns can be used as a justification for eroding the fundamental rights of all For[[Page S373]]these reasons, I cannot support his nomination.

1947,topic-id,2779,"Mr.President, there are a couple of issues that I will speak on, but I was asked earlier this morning about what President Trump has tweeted, basically charging former President Obama with having spied on him in a way that would be plainly illegal. Of course, President Obama's advisers have denied any such thing happened. If it did happen, of course, it would be a grave constitutional issue, and if such a thing did happen, it would be criminal conduct. Now, many people are saying: Well, is it true or not? Was Mr.Trump telling the truth in the tweet or not? There is a very simple response on this. There is one person who knows whether it is true or not, and he has been totally silent on this.  They asked Attorney General Attorney General Sessions made it very clear in his confirmation hearing--well, he said a number of things in his confirmation hearing, but one was, of course, that he would be independent. President Trump has leveled very serious charges against former President I happen to feel the charges are false, but let's have a definitive voice. The Attorney General should have the courage and independence to simply say whether Mr.Trump is telling the truth or not. It is a very simple matter. I would hope that the press and everybody else would keep asking because eventually somebody has to answer that question, and the Attorney General can.                      Nomination of David Friedman  Mr.President, the Senate will soon consider the nomination of David Friedman to be U.Ambassador to Unlike several of President Trump's other nominees, we know a great deal about Mr.Friedman's views on the challenges he would confront if he were confirmed. Unfortunately, this is because he has made a career of disparaging and inflammatory statements about U.policy in the Middle East, about former U.officials, about the Palestinians, even about American Jews who have views that differ from his own.  We have all had the opportunity to read articles Mr.Friedman has written. We have heard the outrageous, unfounded verbal attacks he has launched against those who disagree with him. He has written falsely that President Obama and Secretary Kerry engaged in ``blatant anti-Semitism,'' that the liberal American Jews are ``far worse than kapos,'' and that they ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good and evil,'' that the State Department has a ``hundred-year history of anti-Semitism,'' because diplomats appointed by both Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have not always seen eye-to-eye on every issue with Israel's leaders. He has said that Israel's policy of ``criticizing disloyal Arab citizens while simultaneously bestowing upon them the benefits of citizenship simply isn't working.''  Well, those comments alone should disqualify him for this sensitive position, and it is no surprise that tens of thousands of Americans have signed petitions circulated by pro-Israel groups opposing his nomination.  Mr.Friedman has also raised millions of dollars for Israeli settlers, and he has bragged about the effort to remove the two-state solution from the Republican Party's platform, even though Democratic and Republican Presidents have supported it. Regarding the two-state solution, he wrote: ``It is more of an illusion that serves the worst intentions of both the United States and the Palestinian Arabs,'' in one of the many articles he has written for a rightwing Israeli media outlet. That unequivocal renunciation of longstanding U.policy should also by itself disqualify him from the job of Ambassador to  These statements and actions not only indicate his rejection of decades of Republican and Democratic policy. They are the words of someone who makes a mockery of the term ``diplomat'' and who has demonstrated no ability to be objective and constructive on sensitive issues of immense importance to U.security.  Our diplomats are supposed to be representing the American people and the policies of the United States first and foremost. They are not sent to a foreign country to represent the government or people of that country in a[[Page S1757]]manner that is inconsistent with U.policies and U.interests. They are there to represent us.  Mr.Friedman is certainly entitled to his own views as a private citizen, even if they are offensive and counter to U.interests and values. But can anyone honestly say that this nominee is qualified or suited to represent the American people in Israel?  Five former U.Ambassadors to Israel who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents--from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama--are among the thousands of Americans who say that the answer to that questions is no.  We are being asked to reconcile Mr.Friedman's record, his personal views, and his deep ties to extreme factions in Israel with his responsibility to objectively advance and defend U.interests. Unless one believes, as he has repeatedly made clear he does, that the interests of the United States are always identical to Israel's, there is no way Mr.Friedman should be confirmed.  For as long as I have been in the Senate--and I note that is longer than anybody who is serving here now--I cannot recall a time when we were not at a critical point in our relations with Israel, not because of doubts about the enduring value of the relationship but as a reflection of the importance of the deep partnership between our governments and our people--a deep partnership that we have all supported and that Republican and Democratic Presidents have supported. Most importantly, it is a result of our conviction that security, stability, and prosperity in Israel and the wider region are important to our own national security.  That is why President Obama signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel that included the single largest pledge of U.military aid to any country--to any country anywhere in the world, ever--and why both Democratic and Republican administrations have put so much effort into pursuing peace between Israelis and  An alliance as longstanding as ours with Israel, which has far-reaching consequences for the entire Middle East and beyond, requires effective daily management by an experienced diplomat who has not only knowledge of the region but the necessary temperament and appreciation of our country's short- and long-term interests.  I was here when President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin negotiated what was a very difficult peace agreement between the two of them, with both of them putting the interests of the region first. That agreement has lasted. I also remember when Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan--who had fought against each other--personally negotiated a peace agreement, and the United States strongly supported that. In fact, I was privileged to be there when they signed the agreement at Aqaba, as I was present when Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat signed their agreement.  I do not see how anyone could conclude that Mr.Friedman possesses the requisite temperament, nor am I convinced that he appreciates the critical distinction between the interests of our country, the United States, and the parochial interests of an extreme constituency in Israel who he has fiercely advocated for over the course of his long career.  Indeed, it is telling that the spokesman for Beit El, the Israeli settlement that Mr.Friedman has supported financially for years, said its inhabitants would regard him as their representative in the United These are Their representative in the United States is the Israeli It is not the role of a U.Ambassador to represent another country, but that is how Mr.Friedman is perceived in Israel because that is the way he has behaved.  Every U.President has understood the importance and the heightened sensitivity of this post, and they chose their nominees accordingly--both Republican and Democratic Presidents--until now. That is why every previous nominee to be Ambassador to Israel has been confirmed by a voice vote or by unanimous consent, while Mr.Friedman was voted out by a narrow 12 to 9--largely party line vote--in the Foreign Relations  Mr.Friedman's confirmation hearing provided him the opportunity to assuage concerns about his divisiveness, including the many disparaging remarks he has made and his close identification with and support for the Israeli settler movement.  During the hearing he renounced his undiplomatic language, suggesting it was delivered in the heat of the election cycle and in his capacity as a private citizen. In fact, he recanted so much of what he had said--which far predates the election cycle--that Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Corker asked why he was willing to disavow so much of his past record in order to earn the committee's support.  In response, Mr.Friedman described the role of the U.Ambassador to Israel as ``the fulfillment of a life's dream, of a life's work, of a life of study of the people, the culture, the politics of Israeli society.''  I would say two things about that. One, I recall a nominee for another position who, when asked questions about extreme positions he had taken for years, started disavowing them all, and I finally asked him: Are you having a confirmation conversion? That nominee--the nominee of a Republican President--when he came before the Senate, was defeated because of Republican votes, as well as Democratic votes.  I always worry about a confirmation conversion. When a nominee rejects years and years of deeply held beliefs during those 2 or 3 days of the confirmation hearing, I wonder how long it will last.  There is an important distinction between knowing and respecting a country's history and people and believing that one's own personal ambition and that country's interests are inextricably linked. Mr.Friedman's remarkable confirmation conversion falls far short of convincing evidence that changing his title to ``Ambassador'' will cause him to divorce his life's work and objectively serve the national interests of the United  If Mr.Friedman is confirmed, he should immediately untangle his business and personal interests in Israel and commit to being the representative of all Americans--conservative and liberal Jews, conservative and liberal non-Jews--and being a genuine partner in efforts to promote security and stability for Israelis and Palestinians alike, not just because it is in their interests, but because it is in the interest of the United  We all want what is best for the American people. We also share a desire to find a viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that protects the rights and security of both peoples. Neither goal can be achieved by pursuing policies that further inflame tensions in the region and erode the role of the United States as an honest broker for peace. There are a large number of qualified Americans from both parties who could capably support that role. Mr.Friedman is not among them.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, on another matter, this week is Sunshine It is a time when we rededicate ourselves to transparency in government. It is important to all of us. We celebrate one of our Nation's most defining characteristics: that a government of, for, and by the people does not operate in secret. Our democracy depends on an informed public, and it is critical that public officials be truthful with the American people; yet we are not even 2 months into this Presidency, and it is clear that the administration is not meeting that standard.  The Attorney General has yet to come forward and tell us whether the President was telling the truth when he accused President Obama of breaking the law and spying on him, and the President's nominees have shown a real and stunning indifference to the truth. His nominees to lead the Treasury Department, the EPA, HHS, and the Justice Department have all misled Congress while testifying under oath.  I am disturbed that Senate Republicans continue to look the other way. At some point, they must put country over party. But as these new officials take control of their agencies, I remind them that our laws demand an open and transparent government. Last year, Congress took a strong step to reaffirm our commitment to an open government. We passed the FOIA Improvement Act, which is a bipartisan bill. I coauthored it with the deputy Republican leader, Senator Cornyn of It was the most significant reform to the Freedom of Information Act in[[Page S1758]]over 50 years. It codified the ``presumption of openness.'' It put the force of law behind the notion that sunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government. Given what we have seen thus far from this administration's nominees, transparency, accountability, and open government are more important than ever.  I hope next week, when the President's Supreme Court nominee will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he provides transparent, truthful answers to Senators' questions.  I will insist on real answers from Judge Neil Gorsuch because there are real concerns about his record and his judicial philosophy. Judge Gorsuch went to some of the world's best universities--Columbia, Harvard, Oxford--so it is not surprising that he knows how to make a good impression, but that cannot be the standard for a Supreme Court nominee. The U.Senate cannot simply rubberstamp a nominee because he went to the right schools and looks good on  Neil Gorsuch has been a judge for over 10 years, and it is clear from his writings on and off the bench that he has a well-developed judicial philosophy. He appears to strongly identify as an originalist, in the mold of Justice Scalia or Justice It has been more than 25 years since an originalist was nominated to the Supreme Court, so I expect that Senators will want to understand how Judge Gorsuch would apply his philosophy to the cases that would come before him, if he is confirmed to the Supreme Would he rule in the same way as originalists like Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Judge Bork, who have been deeply hostile to the individual rights and liberties protected by our Constitution? I want to hear directly from him on this important question.  It is one thing for legal academics to debate their preferred theories, including originalism. But the Supreme Court is not a debating society that deals in abstractions--its decisions affect every one of us. Our Federal courts are where Americans go to have their rights vindicated, whether against big corporations or the government itself. Our Federal courts do not exist so that judges have a place to propound their particular philosophies.  I want to make sure that Judge Gorsuch understands that distinction, and I want to understand just how his philosophy would have been applied to important cases. For example, how would someone with his philosophy have ruled in cases upholding fundamental rights, such as Miranda rights, a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, and marriage equality?  We also cannot ignore the fact that Judge Gorsuch was nominated by President Trump only after being vetted by extreme interest groups who did all of that in secret. They are certainly not transparent. It is alarming and unprecedented for a President to outsource the nomination process in this way. The President's top adviser then assured attendees at a conservative conference that they knew Judge Gorsuch has ``the vision of Donald Trump.'' That is the same Donald Trump, of course, who called the media the ``enemy of the American people.'' The President could not be more wrong.  As we note during Sunshine Week, our Constitution provides for the freedom of the press because a democracy cannot survive without it. Citing James Madison, the Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan described the ``public discussion of the stewardship of public officials'' as ``a fundamental principle of the American form of government.''  It was Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, a staunch believer in open government, who famously said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is often the press that shines the sunlight in dark corners where we need it most. It serves as a critical check on our government. It shines a light on corruption, exploitation, and excess. My parents owned a weekly newspaper before they started their printing business. I was brought up to believe in the importance of the First I question whether a Justice with ``the vision of Donald Trump'' would uphold the freedom of the press.  Sunshine Week's emphasis on transparency will not be just this week; it should continue into the hearings next week. The Supreme Court has been the least transparent part of our government, and these hearings will be one of the only opportunities for the American people to get a glimpse into the institution that protects their most essential rights. There are real questions about the kind of Justice Neil Gorsuch would be. He needs to answer them openly and honestly, not with the kinds of dodges and misrepresentations we have heard from other Trump nominees.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The Administrator is responsible for overseeing more than $1 trillion in annual spending and a staff of about 4,000 people. This is a position of vital importance where a new Administrator should hit the ground running, instead of learning on the fly.  And learning on the fly is what she will have to do, as evidenced by her testimony before the Finance When asked to name a specific program she would commit to improving as Administrator, she could not identify even one.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition, first, to this terrible rule, of course, which made no Democratic amendments in order, but also in strong support of Congressman Polis' amendment that requires the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to score the final bill, which is the bill to take away health care from 24 million people, to score it as amended by the Republican manager's amendment before the bill is on the House floor.  This clearly is nothing new for Republicans, though. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, Republicans shamefully pushed ahead with the markup of their terrible ACA repeal bill without a score from the Congressional Budget And this week, on the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans' terrible plan to repeal this lifesaving legislation will make it to the House floor.  One thing is clear. Republicans' proposals, of course written in secret back rooms, would be a disaster for struggling families, seniors, people with disabilities, low-income individuals, the poor, and the middle class.  It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people, reduce benefits, increase rates for those who can least afford this, and transfer $600 billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy. That is outrageous, but it gets even worse.

1991,topic-id,1574,"Mr.President, I rise to speak again today about the epidemic of deadly, illicit fentanyl plaguing our Nation and how, through bipartisan legislation I have introduced today, we can help to stop this dangerous opioid from flowing into our country from abroad.  I want to start by providing some basic information about fentanyl. What[[Page S1976]]is fentanyl? Well, fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be misused, the current fentanyl epidemic in our country is being fueled by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and illicit versions of chemically similar compounds known as fentanyl analogs.  Fentanyl, in its powder form, is often mixed with other illegal drugs like heroin or it is disguised in pill form to resemble an opioid painkiller like Many drug users overdose on fentanyl because they have no idea it is cut into whatever substance they are injecting or whatever pills they are swallowing. They simply do not realize just how deadly fentanyl is.  In fact, just a few salt-size grains of fentanyl can kill an adult. Where does illicit fentanyl come from? According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Mexico is the primary source for illicit fentanyl trafficked into the United Distributors in China are the principal source of the precursor chemicals, the chemical building blocks used to manufacture fentanyl in Mexico and elsewhere.  China is also a source of finished product illicit fentanyl coming into the United Why is illicit fentanyl trafficking increasing? Well, we are in the midst of an opioid epidemic that has begun with the overprescription and resulting abuse of prescription opioids like When users found those pills too expensive to sustain their addiction, they turned to cheaper heroin.  Now they are turning to even cheaper and more powerful fentanyl, which has become an extremely lucrative product for drug dealers and drug cartels. According to the DEA, a kilogram of heroin can be purchased from Colombia for about $6,000 and then sold on the wholesale drug market for $80,000--purchased for 6,000, sold for $80,000. By comparison, a kilogram of pure fentanyl can be purchased from China for less than $5,000 and then sold on the market for $80,000 as well.  Because it is so potent that 1 kilogram of fentanyl can be cut with agents like talcum powder or caffeine, resulting in 24 kilograms of product to be sold, that means that one $5,000 kilogram of fentanyl actually reaps a whopping profit in the neighborhood of $1.6 million.  What has been the impact of the fentanyl epidemic on the United States? Well, the DEA is so concerned about fentanyl that in March of 2015, it issued a nationwide alert that highlighted the drug as a threat to health and public safety. Between 2014 and 2015, overdose deaths in the United States from synthetic opioids, principally illicit fentanyl, increased 72 percent.  In 2015, there were more than 9,500 such overdose deaths in the United Last year, it is estimated that my home State of Massachusetts suffered more than 2,000 opioid-related overdose deaths, largely fueled by the deadly rise of illicit fentanyl. In fact, Massachusetts ranked second notionally per capita in synthetic opioid deaths, which includes fentanyl, with the number of deaths between 2014 and 2015 increasing by 109 percent.  Massachusetts authorities are now finding fentanyl in 74 percent of the State's opioid overdose deaths. If those figures hold up, that means last year there will have been roughly 1,500 fentanyl-related deaths in Massachusetts in 2016. If the fentanyl epidemic were to hit the entire Nation as hard as it is hitting Massachusetts, the country would lose almost 75,000 people each year to fentanyl. Think about that. Those are more deaths than the United States suffered in the entire Vietnam war.  Fentanyl is the Godzilla of opioids. It will overrun communities and lay them to waste, unless we take action now to stop it. So how do we stop it? There is no easy solution to a crisis caused by a drug that is so small, so powerful, so profitable that those who traffic in it just want to make money, but we know we must act.  First, we need to raise awareness of the dire threat fentanyl poses to our We need to educate the public about it. We need to elevate the issues to the highest levels of our government and the governments of the countries from which it comes. To help with that effort, last week, the Senate adopted a bipartisan sense of the Senate resolution on fentanyl trafficking that I introduced with Senator Rubio from I thank him for his partnership on that resolution. I thank Senators Toomey, Shaheen, King, Johnson, and Nelson for adding their support.  The resolution calls on our government to use its broad diplomatic and law enforcement resources in partnership with Mexico and China to disrupt the trafficking of fentanyl. We are seeing the signs of some progress. In October of 2015, China added 116 synthetic chemicals, including 6 fentanyl products, to its list of controlled chemical substances. In February of 2017, China agreed to make carfentanil, a powerful fentanyl analogue, and three other fentanyl analogues illegal.  Earlier this month, I led a group of 10 Senators in urging Secretary of State Tillerson to secure the votes of the 53 member nations of the U.Commission on Narcotic Drugs in favor of the scheduling of the fentanyl precursors. Last week, the Commission voted unanimously in favor of controlling these substances. This international cooperation is expected to yield meaningful dividends in the fight against illicit fentanyl.  Fentanyl will require us to build bridges to our international partners, not walls. Indeed, I recently visited Mexico, where I met with law enforcement officials at the border, on the front lines of the smuggling and trafficking of narcotics into the United That is why today, Senators Rubio, Brown, Capito, and I introduced legislation to help this front line of drug detection at the border. It is called the INTERDICT It provides badly needed high-tech equipment and other resources to U.Customs and Border Protection to help it detect and interdict illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United  Here is how it works. There are two principal ways drugs like fentanyl are trafficked into the United First, coming from Mexico, they are smuggled across the southwest border of the United They are hidden in vehicles, beneath false floors, behind hidden compartments, and elsewhere. The drugs are also carried into the United States by people, sometimes hidden in the hollowed-out heels of their shoes.  Second, illegal fentanyl is also purchased online from overseas vendors in China and elsewhere--often on the dark web--and then shipped to Mexico or directly to the United States through the mail or express consignment carriers.  Fentanyl shipped this way is often concealed inside legitimate goods, with fentanyl suppliers using various methods to mislabel shipments. For example, some conceal the powder in those small silica packages that say ``do not eat'' placed alongside everyday items. Others gift wrap shipments or label them as household products like laundry detergent to avoid detection.  Customs and Border Protection has many different methods it uses to find contraband being smuggled into the United States at the border or through the mail. These include drug-sniffing dogs, various kinds of scanners, fiber-optic scopes, and physical searches. When Customs and Border Protection finds a suspicious substance using those and other methods, it has had success identifying it as an illicit drug like fentanyl with the help of high-tech, handheld chemical screening devices.  So anytime Customs and Border Protection finds a suspicious powder, pill, or liquid, it can use a handheld device--really something that looks and feels like a Nintendo Game Boy--to conduct a test, in the field, with real-time results. That means narcotics like illicit fentanyl can be detected, identified, and seized quickly and on the spot. Those rapid results provide vital information for law enforcement officers to continue their investigation and, if appropriate, proceed with seizure and arrest. Not only does the use of this technology disrupt the flow of the drugs into the country, it protects the health and safety of law enforcement officials from exposure to dangerous substances like illicit fentanyl.  Often, Border Patrol agents don't know what the powdery substance they have uncovered is and whether it poses a threat to them. That is especially alarming with illicit fentanyl, given its strength.[[Page S1977]]  Exposure to a small amount by contact with the skin or through inhalation can be fatal. Increased use of these high-tech devices will provide important protections for our law enforcement officers on the front lines. The INTERDICT Act also provides for additional equipment back in Customs and Border Protection laboratories, including more scientists who analyze and interpret test results.  The INTERDICT Act ensures that Customs and Border Patrol will have hundreds of additional portable chemical screening devices available at international ports of entry and mail and express consignment facilities and additional equipment and personnel available in their laboratories so that they can provide support during all operational hours.  Again, I thank Senator Rubio, Senator Brown, and Senator Capito for working together on a bipartisan basis so we can give these additional tools to fight this fentanyl epidemic. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill to fight the scourge of illicit drugs. It knows no political, geographic, or socioeconomic boundaries. It is the epidemic of our time.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1975.txt,735,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,23.0,January
2014,topic-id,2135,"Mr.President, this is the first day in which a new Senate is assembled in which we ponder traditions of this body. Indeed, it has been described, as my colleague from Texas mentioned, as the world's greatest deliberative body. But over the time I have been familiar with the Senate, it has lost the ability to claim that title, the ``greatest deliberative body.'' It is a completely different institution from the one I first saw in 1976 when I came as an intern for Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, because at that point we[[Page S13]]saw deliberation on the floor about the issues we face. We saw that the use of the filibuster to obstruct ordinary bills was rarely invoked. We saw bipartisan cooperation on big issues facing But that dialogue on the floor is largely missing.  One reason I wanted to sit here and listen to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle speak today was to ponder that tradition in which people listen to each other and ponder the opportunity to address those substantial issues that we have before us. My colleague from Texas, the Republican leader, noted that this past election, the people of America spoke loud and clear about the direction they want this country to go in. Well, certainly that is not the case. The majority of American citizens rejected the policies put forward by President-Elect By 3 million votes, the citizen election overwhelmingly rejected those policies. Indeed, had it not been for a strategy of voter suppression on the Republican side, it would have been far more than 3 million votes rejecting those policies.  Let us be clear that this strategy of voter suppression is an attack on the Our Constitution was founded on the principle that we would pursue policies here that support the success of all That is where our Constitution starts, with these three words: ``We the People.'' That is why the Founders wrote those three words in supersized font--so when you saw the written Constitution from across the room, you couldn't read the fine print but you could see the mission statement: ``We the People.'' It is why Abraham Lincoln summarized the genius of our country as being a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  Let us be clear. Without voter suppression, those 3 million votes, the majority that rejected the Trump policies would have been far larger. Let's remember that if it were not for Russian hacking of the election, that 3-million vote majority that rejected the Trump policies would have been larger yet. Let's remember that if it were not for an out-of-control FBI Director intervening in the final days of the campaign, the citizen vote rejecting Trump would have been even larger.  By the citizen-vote calculation, Trump lost the debate over the direction of If we consider the votes cast for Members of the Senate, overwhelmingly those votes rejected the Republican agenda. So here we are with colleagues who say the American people spoke loud and clear. If you consider the vision of our country and the citizen vote for the Presidency and the citizen vote for Members of the Senate, that loud and clear message is a rejection of the Trump policies.  There is no mandate here to throw millions of people off of their health care. My colleague from Texas said the American people deserve health care they can afford. Well, isn't that the challenge, that when health care has a price tag and there is no ability afforded you, you get no health care? You get health care for the upper middle class and health care for the wealthy but not health care for every citizen. Shouldn't we have a nation in which quality health care is accessible, is affordable to every single citizen? Twenty million more people have access to that now than they had 8 years ago. It is an incredible change.  A woman came up to me at a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis, and she said: Senator, things are so different this year.  I said: What do you mean?  She said: A year ago, before we had the Affordable Care Act, if you got a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, you were in deep trouble. It is a complicated, mysterious disease. It is an expensive disease, and if you had insurance, it likely wasn't going to cover the costs associated with it because of annual limits or lifetime limits.  She noted that if you didn't have insurance, you wouldn't be able to get insurance because you would now have a preexisting condition and no insurer would give you the opportunity to be able to have an affordable health care plan.  She said: Well, what a different place we are in now because now we have the peace of mind that our loved ones afflicted with this terrible disease will be able to get the health care they need.  Isn't that what we should seek--a health care system where people have peace of mind, where we no longer have thousands of bankruptcies based on health care costs, bankruptcies that you don't see in other developed nations that have done a better job of making health care available to every single citizen?  Let's not turn the clock back to whether health care was only for the healthy or the wealthy. Let's not turn the clock back to where our young folks were in a health care desert between the time they left their parent's policy and before they had a career of their own, before we said they could stay on their parent's policy to age 26.  Let's not turn the clock back to the point where we didn't make preventive policies for seniors free, and we found that that ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure. We did that in the Affordable Care Act, and people across the Nation have appreciated that.  It is not just on health care that we see no mandate for the Trump agenda; we don't see any mandate for the Trump agenda on the environment. There is a proposal by the President-elect to put an individual in charge of our environmental policies who has been all about increasing pollution--increasing fine particle pollution that causes asthma and other diseases; increasing mercury pollution, which is a toxic attack on the nervous system and affects the development of our youngsters. A neurotoxin like mercury is something to be controlled, not increased.  There was a commentary by my colleague from Texas that we should expedite the nominees. We know full well that my Republican colleagues did everything they could to obstruct President Obama's nominees. It was not so long ago we were here on the floor and we couldn't get a Department of Labor nominee through this Chamber, or Gina McCarthy with the Environmental Protection Agency, or various judges slated for the DC Circuit  I believe the nomination system needs to be reformed. I believe a President's nominee should get a timely vote. So why don't we consider the possibility of establishing a rule that gives people a timely vote? Why not put a 100-day clock on all nominees but the Supreme Court? If that 100 days ripens and we haven't had a vote on this floor and if a group of Senators wants a vote, then why not hold that vote, with an hour of debate, and hold the vote the next day? But to do that, we would have to have a debate over the rules under which this body functions.  There is no clear path to consider rules, which means we are often trapped by the precedents of the past that have become unworkable. So shouldn't we consider a rule change that gives a clear path for rule changes to be considered on this floor? Isn't that something on which Senators could come together on a bipartisan basis? And by establishing such a course of action, we could consider the possibility of having a 100-day clock on nominees so that they would not be trapped forever in purgatory, not knowing if they are ever going to get a vote. And we know that so many of President Obama's nominees were trapped in purgatory. It has had a terrible impact on those who are willing to consider the possibility of serving the executive branch, not knowing if they will ever get a vote. Couldn't we improve on this?  Isn't improving the nomination process something that is important in the balance of powers, the balance between the legislative branches? Our Constitution created three coequal branches, not a vision in which the legislative branch or half of a legislative branch can run a continuous attack on the judiciary, a continuous attack on the executive branch.  There are other rule changes we ought to consider. We could consider that for Supreme Court nominees, if they are filibustered, it has to be a talking filibuster so that it takes time and effort to obstruct, using the power of the minority, so that there is a conversation directly held day and night, on through the weekend, on through the next week and the following week, on whether debate should be closed on a nominee to the Supreme Currently, we don't have a talking filibuster for the Supreme Court, so if you simply can't get enough votes to close debate, this Chamber is silent. It sits silent rather than being in an engaged dialogue in front of the American people so the American people can weigh[[Page S14]]in on whether the use of the filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee makes you a hero or makes you a bum.  Should we not consider a strategy by which, on ordinary issues of policy, the filibuster is restricted to final passage of a bill rather than having obstruction with each amendment and obstruction with the motion to proceed to a bill, so that we can spend our time debating bills rather than debating whether to debate bills? And what goes hand in hand with moving the filibuster only to final passage is a clear way for amendments to be offered by Members on both sides of the aisle that are relevant to a bill, that are germane to a bill. If we have the ability to clearly debate amendments, we will be closer to being a deliberative body and therefore maybe even the possibility of becoming a great deliberative body or even the world's greatest deliberative body once again. But when we are paralyzed and unable to get bills to the floor or when they are on the floor but we are unable to propose amendments, we won't be there. These two things go hand in hand.  These are all ideas I advocated for when I was in the majority. Today I stand here in the minority arguing for these same fundamental changes. They will strengthen the success of this body for the majority and the minority and strengthen our ability to work together to produce legislation that addresses the big issues facing this  Let's be clear. There is no mandate for the Trump agenda, no mandate for dismantling health care for millions of There is no mandate for increasing air and water pollution, no mandate for tax giveaways to the richest Americans, no mandate for increasing the disparity in compensation between ordinary workers and the best off, the most powerful, and the most privileged.  We will indeed, as our Democratic leader noted, hold the President-elect accountable. The President-elect said, ``I am going to drain the swamp,'' but he has proposed turning the economy over to Goldman Sachs, to the banking world, and he has proposed turning over our foreign policy to Exxon, the fossil fuel world. That is the opposite of draining the swamp. We will hold the President-elect accountable.  The President-elect said he was going to fight for working people. Well, proposing a Secretary of Labor who is against working people getting fair compensation is inconsistent, to say the least, with a pledge to fight for working people. We will hold the President-elect accountable.  There is much work to be done, but if we hold as our North Star the vision that we are here as a legislative body to fight for the vision of ``we the people,'' policies that lift up all Americans, give an opportunity for every American to thrive, then perhaps we will find a course in which we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to make America greater and greater.

2066,topic-id,531,"Mr.President, having said that, I am on the floor today with a number of my colleagues who will be joining me throughout the time here today in the Senate to stand up and to be a voice for women.  I was so proud to march this weekend with millions of women and men in a[[Page S411]]clear rejection of the hate and division that President Trump campaigned on and in strong support of every woman's rights.  This past weekend, we also recognized the anniversary of the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade, a decision that has empowered women and expanded economic opportunity and security for families for more than four decades.  I have heard story after story from Washington State and across the country about what Roe v. Wade means for women. It means being able to plan your family, to be able to pursue your dreams and give back to your community. But perhaps most importantly, the decision in Roe v. Wade sent a clear message that access to abortion--a woman's right to make the most personal of all decisions herself--is fundamental to her freedom and her ability to chart her own path.  Now we have already seen extreme politicians in State after State do everything they can to undermine access to abortion. But, today, the constitutionally protected rights these women have had now for 44 years are, unfortunately, more at risk than ever as a result of President Trump's extreme and deeply harmful agenda.  He has promised to pick Supreme Court nominees whose beliefs about women's reproductive rights simply could not be more backwards or damaging. Unfortunately, in what looks like a sign of things to come, the President yesterday signed an Executive order limiting access to safe abortion and other family planning services on women worldwide by reinstituting the global gag rule.  I want to be very clear. If the President continues down this path, women will be hurt. Their lives will be put at risk, and the same goes for women around the world. So I am very concerned, and I am angry.  But if Saturday's march proved anything, it proved that women and men across this country are more motivated than ever, and, frankly, so am  Now, I can understand why President Trump may not have wanted to hear from the hundreds of thousands of marchers who completely filled the National Mall on Saturday or the millions more who marched nationwide in every State--coast to coast--and on every continent. But if he didn't get the message, this is just the beginning.  The millions of women and people who care about women's rights and their access to health care are going to keep standing up, and we in the Senate are going to continue to stand with them and fight back every step of the way and do everything in our power to make sure that our country does not go backwards.

The Hornets dominated in the championship game just last weekend, winning 4-0. Senior forward Lolita Fidler led the way with an early goal in the first period, finishing with two goals. On the other end, senior goalie Anna Goldstein stood on her head throughout the tournament, allowing just one goal in three games.  The girls squad finished with an impressive 28-1-1 record under head coach Sami Reber, who is a former Edina hockey player herself, bringing the title to her alma mater.

1906,topic-id,737,"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.[[Page H1380]]  My amendment is simple. It rescinds the authority to spend up to $30 million on a commission to do what Congress and the agencies already do.  If you want duplication, look no further than this bill. It seeks to reduce the size of bureaucracy by establishing a new commission to serve a function already performed without the contribution of an additional $30 million in taxpayer funding.  Now, $30 million may not be too much to the true benefactors of this bill on K Street, but to seniors, veterans, students, and workers all across this country, it can go a long way. For example, Social Security's meager 0.3 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2017 amounts to $4 more in benefits per month for the average beneficiary. That means that $30 million would be enough to double that cost-of-living adjustment for 7.5 million seniors.  We all know that the cost of additional sequestration cuts on education, health, and the environmental protection loom at the end of this fiscal year.  The double talk and schizophrenia of my esteemed colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee who pushed this bill through the committee has me truly concerned for the mental state of this They want to defund Planned Parenthood, but want to fund a nine-member task force at a cost of $30 million.  They drag their feet and hem and haw to assist Flint, Michigan, in funding to promote clean water and save the lives of a community, but we can sure fund a task force to duplicate already-carried-out activities by the Federal Government so we can say we did it to the tune of $30 million.  The chair of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee wouldn't allow the people of the Virgin Islands, for 100 years as part of the United States, to receive $100,000 already earmarked for our interior. But, we have money for this bill. And let's not discuss all the block-granting discussions going on around here in this  Today, the House majority is now asking to authorize $30 million on a bill that would handcuff enforcement agencies in their ability to respond to even more pressing new public health and safety problems.  Let me be clear. Reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape on small businesses is a goal that we all share. I recognize that some regulation is burdensome, and there should be a review of the code to determine what can be consolidated or repealed to reduce compliance costs.  One of the things that we seem to agree on is that retrospective review is helpful in the regulatory process. But, retrospective review is already going on with money that has already been authorized. All of the agencies have been required to do this under standing executive orders issued by President  As has been discussed before, the results have been successful in reducing regulations. Agencies have yielded billions of dollars in cost savings and reduced reporting requirements through the modification of existing regulations.  People in my district get it that there is a cost to protecting the environment, but they know that keeping our workers safe and our waters clean is worth it. There can be and is red tape that is unnecessary, and there is ongoing work and focus to eliminate and reduce that.  Could there be ways to improve upon existing review regulations? There very well may be, and I am willing to work with anyone on a good idea.  Even if $30 million were to come from elsewhere in the budget instead of additional spending, it would be that much less that agencies would have to conduct the already ongoing retrospective review process now going on.  Furthermore, we in Congress also have existing responsibility to actively conduct oversight of government operations and make legislative changes as we see fit.  There is simply no reason to spend $30 million on this messaging effort to ignore the successful work that is already going on by qualified people, and to hobble the ability of regulators to safeguard public health and safety in the process.  This Congress has money to throw at solutions in search of a problem, but requires cost offsets to provide aid for victims of Flint or toward Zika funding.  Please approve my amendment to save this money.  Mr.Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.Courtney).

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today that provides for consideration of H.1101, the so-called Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017.  This bill, first of all, from a procedural basis, did not allow even a discussion of the amendments that my Democratic colleagues brought forward to improve the bill. This rule has something called the structured amendment process, which basically means that Democrats are locked out from presenting our ideas for improving this bill. We are not even allowed a 10-minute debate or a vote on any of the ideas that many of my colleagues brought forward.

2090,topic-id,1485,"Mr.Speaker, Margo Sanger-Katz said, in part: ``But one piece of context has gone little noticed: The Republican bill would actually result in more people being uninsured than if ObamaCare were simply repealed. Getting rid of the major coverage provisions and regulations of ObamaCare would cost 23 million Americans their health insurance. . . . In other words, 1 million more Americans would have health insurance with a clean repeal than with the Republican replacement plan, according to CBO estimates.''  So it is just unclear what the Republicans are trying to do here. If the goal was to come up with something worse than repealing the Affordable Care Act, they certainly reached that goal: less people will have coverage, more tax breaks for billionaires, higher rate increases for most On every account, it actually underperforms a cleaner repeal.  What Democrats wanted to do is improve the Affordable Care And I want to be clear, none of us have ever argued the Affordable Care Act is perfect. I pushed for fixes. So many of my Democratic and Republican colleagues have pushed for fixes to strengthen the law, like repealing the medical device tax, which adds cost to health care, and altering the Cadillac tax on insurance premiums.  In the Education and the Workforce Committee, I actually offered three amendments to show some of the ideas that I and some of my colleagues had to improve the Affordable Care They offered an amendment to establish a public option in the exchange, to provide a baseline of competition in every ZIP Code in this country--defeated on a partisan vote. I should add that my proposal for a public option--and I am a cosponsor of the bill to do the same--would actually reduce the budget deficit by over $50 billion.  I also offered an amendment for pricing transparency to help make the market in health care work. One of the major market fallacies in health care is a Byzantine pricing structure where, frequently, different entities and people are paying different amounts for the same thing. If we had simple pricing transparency and quality transparency, we would go a long way towards making markets work in health care--defeated on a party vote.  Finally, I offered an amendment that would have allowed reimportation of prescription drugs. When you have a situation where--we have a popular example of this in the EpiPen, costing Americans who need access to the EpiPen over $400, and yet in neighboring countries--Canada, Australia--EpiPens cost $40 or $50, one-tenth as much.  It is not unique to the By no means is that an exception to the rule. In fact, it is the rule. By allowing reimportation of prescription drugs, a proposal that was backed in the Senate in a bipartisan way by many of my Democratic and Republican colleagues as a budget amendment, we could actually reduce costs in health care, making the goal of expanding coverage even easier with those reduced costs.  You know, when I think about health care, I think it is important to think about who in our districts and States it most affects. I think of Pat Hayward, a constituent in my district who lives in  Pat has so many family members who would be directly impacted by the repeal of the For instance, her husband has melanoma and over the years has needed several procedures to remove cancerous cells from his skin.[[Page H2263]]Had those procedures not been done in a timely and efficient manner, it could cause major complications, including premature death for Pat's husband.  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, when they tried to change insurance carriers, her husband was told that any coverage would exclude coverage of cancers, the very type of coverage he needed, because it was a preexisting condition. They literally would have had to choose between bankruptcy or being forced out of their home and into destitution or not getting the lifesaving melanoma treatments that he needed.  But it is not just Pat's husband who has benefited and perhaps is alive and thriving today because of the protections of the Affordable Care Pat's eldest son took advantage of a provision that allowed him to stay on his parents' plan until he got a job with health insurance at age 25.  Their younger son has struggled with anxiety and panic attacks, but thanks to comprehensive mental health treatment and the protections of the mental health parity that are in the Affordable Care Act--and being rolled back under the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to replace it--their son is now back in college and thriving.  Pat, herself, expressed gratitude. The Affordable Care Act covers wellness visits and tests like mammograms, which can detect problems early, reduce costs, and save lives.  I share this story--and Pat wanted me to share her story--because families like the Haywards are like families in every State, in every county, in every ZIP Code in the country. American families have faced their share of medical challenges, as have mine, and I am sure that yours has as well, Mr.Medical challenges crop up unexpectedly. They don't have any bias toward a political party. They affect Democrats and Republicans and Independents and Greens and apathetic voters and diligent participants in our civic system. They make no distinction.  But the Affordable Care Act is there to make it easier for families across our country to stay healthy, to get better, to save their lives so that kids can grow up with their parents healthy, kids can grow up and be able to go to school and get good jobs.  And like so many of my constituents, Pat told me she would rather see the current system improved than thrown out entirely, and I agree. That is why I offered the pricing transparency amendment, the public option amendment, and the reimportation of prescription drug amendment; and there are dozens of other ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act from my side of the aisle. I offered amendments in committee that would have codified these provisions into law.  I plan to continue to fight to improve access and lower healthcare costs, but dismantling the Affordable Care Act is simply counterproductive towards that end.  The Republican proposal to create a brand-new entitlement program would cause 24 million Americans to lose their insurance--over 1 million more than repealing the Affordable Care For those who are lucky enough to still have their insurance, it would increase rates by 15 to 20 percent.  It would also, for reasons unknown, have an enormous tax cut for billionaires and millionaires. We know Republicans want to do that, but they should do that through a tax bill, not through something that is supposed to be a healthcare bill--enormous tax cuts. We are not even talking the wealthiest 1 percent. Most of those tax cuts go to the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent of That certainly doesn't help reduce the cost of health care.  Again, this bill can be debated, and, frankly, many of us feel it presents a problem in the risk pools that remove consumer protections. There is a solvency issue around some of these groups. There is a legitimate debate to be had, but we certainly haven't heard anybody present that somehow this bill is any kind of answer to making health care more affordable or expanding coverage.  What we have before us over the next couple of days is a bill that not only is the answer, but is a bill that creates an even bigger problem. The Republican healthcare bill would dig us in a deeper hole with regard to health care, leaving more Americans without coverage, creating a costly, brand-new entitlement program, and raising rates for those Americans who are lucky enough to still have their insurance after the Republicans remove it from tens of millions of people.  If that bill is the answer, what is the question?  Is the question, Mr.Speaker: How do we make health care cost more for American families?  Is the question, Mr.Speaker: How do we have less people covered and throw 20 million people off of health care insurance?  Is the question, Mr.Speaker: How do we make sure that, rather than work hard and try to get a raise or work two jobs, Americans are forced to quit their jobs and be lazy and not work just so that they can have Medicaid eligibility, which is what the brand-new Republican entitlement program would do?  Or, is the answer to move forward in a bipartisan way to improve the Affordable Care Act, a discussion that so many of us are excited to have.  I was disappointed that my three amendments were shut out in partisan votes in committee, and I am hopeful that by resetting this process, we can work together to reduce costs and expand coverage. Defeating the rule today will be the first step towards accomplishing that.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Even the germane amendments of this particular bill before us today, Democrats were locked out.

2104,topic-id,1065,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, the statistics we are talking about, the fact that it will cost Americans 15 to 20 percent more to get health care, the fact that it will cost 24 million Americans their insurance, these are not statistics that are made up by some group that wants to oppose the Republican effort. They are facts that are arrived upon by the Congressional Budget Office, the head of which was appointed by a They do diligent work to determine how much bills cost and what their effect is.  Now, of course, you know, those are best estimates. Maybe, instead of 24 million people who will lose coverage under the Republican healthcare bill, maybe it will be 25 million, maybe it will be 23 million. There is always a little bit of variation on what those predictions are.  But whether it is 23 million or 25.6 million, the fact that Americans--millions, tens of millions of Americans--will lose coverage under this Republican bill should be a flashing warning sign that it is time to slow down and work in a collaborative manner to improve the Affordable Care Act, rather than create a brand new entitlement program that throws 24 million people off the insurance rolls, and increases the cost for those who remain by 15 to 20 percent.  This bill immediately before us is a diversion from the real story in health care. In my home State alone, 600,000 Coloradans would likely lose coverage if the American Health Care Act is rammed through Congress, as my Republican colleagues intend to do.  The American Health Care Act would roll back important protections and coverage gains. It would create a brand new entitlement program, while delivering record tax breaks for billionaires in New York and  It is clear that this bill threatens the health and welfare of hundreds of thousands of families in Colorado alone, tens of millions across the country. It is time that we get this process right and slow down, rather than cramming a midnight bill through the House of Representatives that we don't even know the cost of, before we are voting on it.  This is simple, Mr.Democrats are excited to roll up our sleeves and work together to create a plan that will reduce healthcare costs. If you don't like the amendment I offered for allowing reimportation of prescription drugs, let's talk about other options.  What about Medicare negotiating prescription drug rates? What about removing tax deductibility for the advertisements for pharmaceutical companies?  What about expediting approval process at the FDA, which President Trump himself mentioned in this very Chamber as a proposal that can reduce the cost of approving drugs from the $1.2 billion it costs today, which is passed along to consumers, to a much lower cost, thereby passing the savings along to consumers.[[Page H2266]]  There are plenty of good ideas the Democrats and Republicans can work together on. None of them are this bill before us today. None of them are in the repeal of the Affordable Care So let's just stop this ridiculous partisan process.  I don't want 24 million Americans to be victims of partisanship in I don't want other Americans who pay for their healthcare insurance to be victims of partisanship in  I want to make sure that people in my district who are working hard and only able to afford coverage under the Affordable Care Act because of the healthcare subsidies are not forced into medical bankruptcy and to give up their jobs and rely on Medicaid because of Republican efforts to ram through this brand new entitlement program.  Let's get this right. There is plenty of opportunity to work together to reduce costs and expand coverage. The American Health Care Act does the exact opposite. It increases costs and reduces coverage.  And instead of these incremental bills, like this so-called Small Business Health Fairness Act, which actually winds up removing protections and pushing more costs onto working families and seniors, we should improve upon and fix the Affordable Care Act that we put in place 7 years ago. We should support innovation to produce healthier outcomes, to reduce costs, and, yes, to expand coverage across our country.  We have a unique opportunity in this Congress to put partisanship behind us, to work together to make affordable health care a reality for every American family. Because you know what? When you have a preexisting condition, like I talked about Pat's husband in my district who suffers from melanoma, it doesn't matter whether he is a Republican or a Democrat or Independent or whether he is not even registered at all.  What matters is that he is a father to two children, a husband to his wife, and he wants the ability to work with dignity, support himself, and have medical insurance to receive his lifesaving monthly injections that allow him to maintain his quality of life and continue to work and pay taxes and support his kids and family. That is what healthcare coverage is all about.  So let's stop this silly partisanship. This Republican American Health Care Act actually kicks more people off of the healthcare rolls than simply repealing By creating this brand new entitlement program, they are actually costing an additional 1 millions Americans their healthcare insurance.  But the answer is not to cost 23 million people their healthcare insurance. It is not to take it away from 24 million people. You know what the answer is, Mr.Speaker, is to provide a way that more people can work hard and pay into the system, and that we decrease the number of Americans who lack access to healthcare insurance which, in turn, reduces the costs for the rest of us because of the cost shifting that occurs within health care.  Mr.Speaker, I know so many of my friends on the Republican and Democratic side of the aisle, dedicated public servants with thoughtful ideas that they have based on their life experiences, that they want to present before this body to reduce the cost of health care. Let's let them do it. Let's have an open process.

And how do you get them to schedule these drugs so that they are illegal in China, to ensure the inputs into the laboratories and the final drug itself?  By the way, the Chinese should have a strong interest in this because, I will guarantee you, there are people in China who are also becoming addicted to opioids because of this inexpensive, incredibly dangerous synthetic heroin that is being promoted by these Chinese scientists.

1951,topic-id,2058,"Madam President, I rise today to speak about the historical and unprecedented wildfires that burned through southwest Kansas last week. We had fires in 21 of our Kansas counties, roughly one-fifth of our High winds and dry conditions caused fires of the highest classification that blazed across central and western Kansas some 30 to 40 feet high, burning more than 700,000 acres of land, making this the largest wildfire in our State's history. The Kansas Division of Emergency Management has said it could take weeks to determine the full extent of devastation from the fires. Clark County, KS, officials--that is the county that was the hardest hit--estimate a devastating loss of anywhere from 3,000 to 9,000 head of cattle. That is just in one county. As I indicated, Clark County was the hardest hit by the windblown fires, with over 85 percent of the land in the county consumed by these prairie fires. This is hundreds of thousands of acres in one county and over 700,000 in regard to our  On Friday, I drove south from Dodge City, KS, through range and ranchland I didn't even recognize. What used to be gently rolling prairie, dotted with herds of cattle and crisscrossed by fencing, is now reduced to blackened dust. Friends of mine lost their ranch when a 40-foot wall of fire roared out of the valley over the bluff and burned out their operation. We have unimaginable damage to land and property, but also heart-wrenching scenes of cattle and wildlife burned, wounded, and wandering.  Many Kansans lost everything. According to Sheriff John Ketron of Clark County, 31 houses and over 440,000 acres were burned there. We have longtime friends there, John and Carol We have known them for years. John said with tears in his eyes: ``Pat, it took me 43 years to build up this operation, and it took about an hour to take it all down.'' Riding with Sheriff Ketron, we were assessing the town of Ashland, where a volunteer firefighting force managed to save the town when it became surrounded in flames. Some volunteers were fighting fires elsewhere in the area and learned their own homes had been engulfed and lost.  I met with brave people in the towns of Englewood and Ashland, KS, in the heart of Clark County, who had just come through frightening experiences fighting the unpredictable and unstoppable fires. Some were out driving cattle away from the fires and had become separated from loved ones. When the flames turned, they were left to pray for their safety.  Kylene Scott, with the High Plains Journal, calls it ``the worst day of her life.'' She wrote a courageous and honest account of the day. I will read her words now:       I think I had them going the right way, then the wind      switched. Now I just don't know. When I heard the crack in my      husband's voice yesterday afternoon, I knew it was bad. He is      normally the calm, cool, collected one.       A family friend alerted him to the fire in Clark County      very near the Scott farm after we'd returned home from      burying my Dad yesterday.  Coming back from a funeral.       When they said the closest neighbor was being evacuated he      went as quickly as he could fearing for the cattle herd he'd      worked the last five years to build following the death of      his own I stayed behind with the boys at our house 40      miles away.       When the wind switched at my house from south/southwest to      the north, I began to worry even more and called him. At this      point he was waiting out the fire and smoke in the wheat      field, helplessly watching the house and barn burn. I wanted      to be at the farm so bad, but there wasn't much that could be      done. When he made it home unscathed I was pretty happy, but      sad at the same time. Knowing there was nothing we could do      to fix what it took for Mother Nature mere minutes to      destroy.       Fifty-two cows are on the farm, with about half or \3/4\ of      them with young calves. Most are accounted for. All the grass      is gone, as is the hay stockpile. He went and hauled water to      the cows this morning and some are scorched and others have      udders with burns. One cow was bawling for her missing calf.      ``Those poor mommas,'' was my text reply to him this morning.       I made my way early this afternoon to see the farm or      what's left of it with my own eyes. As bad as I wanted to be      down there, a piece of me dreaded the drive. The closer I got      to the farm, the worse it got. Blowing dirt, darkening skies      because of the dust and awful winds. I pulled in the drive,      like I had done a hundred times in the nearly 20 years I have      been part of the family, and I had to stop my vehicle. The      tears came and the heartbreak overwhelmed me.       I thought of the old white farm house with the wonderful      front porch, where my husband spent a large majority of his      childhood in and around. My fondest memory is when we'd stop      and see my husband's Grandma She'd always have      something sweet to eat and a cold drink at the kitchen table.      The home had been around for 100 years and still had a large      portion of the family momentos in it. It was reduced to ashes      and rubble. All that's standing is the chimney.[[Page S1762]]       I couldn't see the barn around the trees, but I again had      to stop and sit when I pulled around the corner. The barn.      The old barn with its red siding. I remember when my father-     in-law had it painted and how proud he was because it looked      so good. I remember when he laid the brick in front of the      tack room and built a new door for it. My boys explored every      inch of it when we worked calves last fall. You could      ``almost'' hear the horses munching in the stalls decades ago      when you stood in the center alley. Now it's just a charred      pile of tin.       I realize the house and barn are just buildings. Things can      be replaced. But dang, it's so hard to see it all reduced to      ashes and rubble. To see part of the Scott family history,      more than a hundred years, just be gone. Just like that. It's      hard.       We've had incredible friends and family offering help, hay      and feed, and it's heartwarming to know how much people care.      Like I heard an Ashland, Kansas resident on the news this      morning being interviewed, it's just what southwest Kansas      people do. Help and survive.  Here is a picture that was taken on Kylene and Spencer Scott's wedding day in 2009 up here. It is a beautiful sight. Off in the distance is the Clark County It is rolling hills, cattle country, cattle, and grass. Looking at this picture now, it is not hard to wonder how this land will come back to provide for so many, as it has for generations of Kansas farm and ranch families whose sweat and blood have produced for Kansas, our Nation, and, yes, the world, as well.  There is the other picture. They got married here. It was the happiest day of their life. They saw this, and that became just about the worst day of their life. And yet, having seen this devastation firsthand, I don't wonder about Kansas and our ability to rebuild. It is in our State motto: Ad astra per aspera--to the stars through difficulties.  In one of the emergency management centers I met Joyce When I asked her what I could do to help, she just said: ``The Lord will provide.'' She had lost virtually everything. I think that pretty well sums it up. The faith of Kansans gives us courage to rebuild--the courage to come through fire. Ashland banker Kendall Kay emotionally said:       Senator, we are going to need help. We really don't want      it, but we are going to need it.  I am so proud of the people of my State who have come in with that help before they were even asked. I had been in contact with all of our producer groups in Kansas--the Kansas Livestock Association, the Kansas Farm Bureau--who along with our State agencies had been leading the voluntary relief effort. I commend them for their efforts in collecting hay for cattle, as well as monetary donations, coming in from all parts of the United States, and volunteer coordination for repairs to property and fencing.  With Congressman Roger Marshall of the First Congressional District, and my colleague here and friend in the Senate, Jerry Moran, we have been in touch with the Department of Agriculture with regard to assistance that should be available to farmers and ranchers in counties that have suffered losses.  Here is what we are trying to fix. This fellow is walking across here to that bluff that overlooks that valley that Spencer and Kylene looked over, and this fellow here is Chad Tenpenny, my top guy in That is me with my hands in my pockets. It is pretty rough to see ground like this that was grass and to look at the utter devastation. Folks, when that wind blows and when that dust starts up again, we could be in for even more trouble. So cleanup is under way, but we are trying to get help to cut through the redtape and get a disaster declaration.  I talked to the Governor this afternoon. Primarily, it is the Emergency Conservation Program, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, that are the key programs. It won't make people whole by any means, but it will give them hope. So cleanup is under way.  Kansas is a bootstrap It is not just about building new fencing. We have families who have lost the farmhouse and all the equipment they need to rebuild. Many livestock producers have had the gruesome task of euthanizing cattle that have been badly burned. We have to remove the carcasses. We have to find land for the survivors to graze. And we have a lot of uncertainty. How long will it take for the grasses to come back? When can we get rain to avoid a dust bowl? It is really too soon to tell. But we have been through disasters before. Almost 1 year ago, we had the Anderson Creek fire, and we have come through tornadoes and ice storms. Recovery from disasters of this magnitude, however, requires us to cut through the redtape. It requires getting the right information to producers so they know how to apply for aid and then to expedite it. Yes, it requires us to look at our programs to see where we can improve them.  Now, this fire has not received much attention in the national media. You see, we are a flyover All we do is produce food and fiber for Kansas and our Nation and for a troubled and hungry world. But I do want to commend members of the press in Kansas, especially photographer Bo Rader of the Wichita Eagle, who took this photo of my State Director Chad Tenpenny and me walking through rangeland outside of  The Wichita Eagle has gone out of their way to show the world what this fire looks like to real people. The Hutchison News, the High Plains Journal, and the Dodge City Daily Globe have all told and are telling this story. The same is true for the TV and the radio crews who have helped get the news of town evacuations safety notices to our people. This is what they do.  Rest assured that, as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am committed to the Kansans I serve. They know me. I know them.  I know that Clark County and the other 20 counties will come back. We will ensure they get the help they need. Ad astra per aspera--to the stars through difficulty. It is not just a motto; it is who we are.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

In Indiana alone and in my district, I have met person after person who has horror stories about thefailure of  I spoke with Anna, whose husband, Jack, survived stage IV cancer. With Jack's cancer only having a 30 percent survival rate,it is crucial that he has effective doctors who know how to treat and how to work the problem. Instead, Anna's doctor quitpracticing medicine--well before his planned retirement age--due to the burdensome costs of ObamaCare, which is something that thegentleman from Georgia also mentioned.  It is not just doctors who are unable to perform their duties--their profession--under this insidious law, but also insurancecompanies that are withdrawing from the market as we speak. Last year alone, we saw Indiana's exchange lose 50 percent of itshealth insurance carriers due to regulations of This included IU Health, which covered almost 30,000 Thislack of options means that healthy Hoosiers are being forced to pay for coverage that they don't want, that they don't need, andthat, in fact, may do more harm than good.  I spoke with Mark from Tippecanoe County, in my district, who talked about the harmful impact of He stated thathe was forced to buy insurance with only four doctors listed as providers for the entire county. What good does this insurancedo Mark or the rest of us if he can't even use it and schedule an appointment?  I am very proud to have worked on this Republican Study Committee with the Health Care Task Force, led by my good friend,Phil Roe of Over a period of a year or so, we have[[Page H378]]put together a plan that is a very real, patient-centered, consumer-focused, free market-driven replacement for ObamaCare, but with one big difference--our plan would workbecause it harnesses the value that we all have innately as Americans and, really, as humans, which is the ability to valueprice once we have the information.  If I left this Chamber and, God forbid, I broke my leg on my way down the steps, I wouldn't worry too much about where I wasgoing--just to the nearest emergency room. But that is not most of our healthcare transactions; that is not most of ourhealthcare decisions. Most of our healthcare decisions can be made by attaching value to the services and products that we want.We do it in every other part of our consumer-driven life. Why can't we finally do it with health care? That is what people likePhil Roe have practiced in medicine their entire lives. That is what he has taught me. That is what we know as Why can't we be trusted to do that with our health care?  Whether the intent is malicious, whether the intent is malign, the intent of the people who support ObamaCare--that insidiouslaw--is wrong. It says: just give your life over to these few people, and let them run it for a while, and everything will befine. Unfortunately, throughout not only American history, every time it has been tried here and every time it has been tried inworld history, it has failed.

You know, some time ago, when I first got involved in this political processing, I made it known that I felt that the silent killer of American business was the regulatory regime that we have in place, where over 50 years this Congress has ceded its authority to unelectable, unaccountable bureaucrats. Today we have 175,000 pages in the Code of Federal Register that is evidence of that. It is time that we, as a Congress, on behalf of our constituency, on behalf of the future well-being of this country, take back that authority with oversight and accountability through this SCRUB  It has been said that there is approximately, on average, $20,000 a year per employee of a manufacturer that is attributable just to compliance with regulation. We need to make sure that we have our manufacturers, our businesses, doing that which they do best within a reasonable regulatory scheme, and that is what this act offers: a reasonable regulatory scheme that allows Congress who has the authority--actually has the only authority--to hold accountable these unelectable bureaucrats. The SCRUB Act will allow us to do that.  It will allow due process through a discovery process. More importantly, the review board, the commission, the five bipartisan members who are appointed by the President must be confirmed by the This, in and of itself, is a sense of due process, a sense of accountability, and, more importantly, a strong sense of purpose that the American people would want to see this Congress be able to go in and take back the authority that they have delegated--at sometimes recklessly--to these bureaucratic organizations.  We talk about the $30 million. I know the $30 million is always big in any equation that you have, but when you allow the $30 million to be spent over 5 years and you allow that to have the removal of certain regulations, you will pay for this $30 million 10 times over in no time at all.

It currently requires the commission to consider whether the rule could be repealed without significant adverse effects, whether the rule is unnecessary, whether the costs are justified by the benefits, and certain other criteria.  I think that the consideration of public health certainly fits within whether the rule would have significant adverse effects, whether it is necessary, and whether the benefits justify the cost. Health, safety, and welfare of the American people is foremost to what we do, and I laud my colleague from California for filing this amendment.  This amendment clarifies that the commission should consider the impact on public health of repealing any regulation. I think that, again, my colleague from California gave fine examples of that particular balance.  We agree that we want regulations that are necessary to protect public health. I am excited to see one of my Democratic colleagues working with us to improve regulatory reform legislation. I look forward to future opportunities to continue this work.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Madam Chair, I look forward to, in the future, working on true bipartisan regulation. I think it is one of those areas, at least in my experience in local and State government, that we should be working in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, this bill I do not believe accomplishes that.  So regulatory oversight is probably the most important thing we could do, and I hope that we can do it in a bipartisan way in the future. I would encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.

By removing the funding in this amendment, the commission will not be able to hire staff, rent office space, establish the public website as required in the bill, or hold the public meetings, which are also required in the bill. This amendment essentially guts the bill.  The commission established under this bill has a momentous job ahead of it. The Code of Federal Regulations totals more than 178,000 pages. This is approximately 36,000 pages of regulations for review every year of the 5 years the commission has to conduct its work.  But it is not just simply reading the pages. There is work behind understanding whether the regulations are effective. There is outreach and public hearings to understand how the regulations are or aren't effective.  I believe the savings from eliminating unnecessary costs and the improved efficiency from weeding out unneeded regulations will far outweigh the resources applied to this effort.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulations impose a cost on the economy of $1.8 trillion. Who bears that cost but the consumers? This amendment would gut the bill. $30 million over 5 years is more than reasonable, considering the economic impact that these regulations have had on the American business and the American economy.

Amendment 5 Offered by Mr.McNerney  The Acting It is now in order to consider amendment 5 printed in House Report 115-20.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 31, line 17, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``,      except that the term does not include any rule relating to      the physical and cyber security of the bulk-power system (as      defined in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.     824o(a)), including any emergency action to protect and      restore reliability of the bulk-power system''.  The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from California (Mr.McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It exempts from the bill any agency rule relating to the physical and cybersecurity of the bulk power system, including any emergency action to protect and restore reliability. The bulk power system is comprised of facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electrical transmission network to maintain reliability.  Our Nation's electrical system touches each and every part of our lives, hospitals, schools, transportation, homes, businesses, and our national security. Our electrical system is the central element of our Nation's critical infrastructure because all other components of our infrastructure depend on it.  The electrical system is composed of 640,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and more than 6 million miles of distribution lines. This network is undergoing a transformation. There are an ever-increasing number of devices that are connected to the grid; technological advancements are allowing for efficiencies and cheaper production of power, whether it is renewable energy or natural gas; and consumers have more choices and more control. With increased digitization, automation and interaction also have enhanced grid flexibility and security.  While these developments present tremendous opportunities, such as new jobs and reducing carbon emissions, they also pose additional physical and cyber threats to the transmission and distribution systems. Stakeholders across the system are facing numerous new threats and challenges in detecting problems, responding to intrusions, and keeping rates affordable while maintaining reliability. The long-term health of the electricity sector is now, more than ever, a shared responsibility between communities, consumers, industry, and government.  Despite these challenges, the bulk power system is an example of industry stakeholders and the Federal Government working well together, when needed, and working independently, when needed and succeeding.  Transmission and distribution providers have taken it upon themselves to establish industry-led standards, best practices, and supply chain management when it comes to grid security. They have worked well with NERC and FERC in developing Critical Infrastructure Protection standards for the bulk power system.  These Critical Infrastructure Protection standards cover critical cyber asset identification, security management, personnel and training, electronic security, physical security, systems security, incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans. There are 72 inactive CIP standards, and 11 that are now subject to enforcement. These standards aren't always perfect, but they do represent compromise and collaboration.  A well-protected and reliable grid makes economic sense. Power outages and disturbances can cost more than $180 billion annually, and data suggests that electrical system outages attributable to weather-related events are increasing, costing the U.economy an estimated $20 billion to $55 billion annually. Electric companies are projected to spend more than $7 billion of their own money on cybersecurity alone by the year 2020, and are expected to invest nearly $53 billion to enhance the grid.                              {time}  1530  These are significant investments, but essential investments as well. A more resilient, secure electric sector is something we all benefit from. It will continue to require investments at all levels, including from the Federal  We should enhance funding for our national laboratories that have partnered together via the Grid Modernization Lab We should provide high levels of funding for the Office of Electricity and its mission to ensure the energy delivery system is more secure, resilient, and reliable. We must promote R&D that helps bring new, innovative technologies to the grid.  We will always struggle to keep ahead of those bad actors who are seeking to attack us, but we can establish metrics, procedures, and technological capabilities that allow us to respond and adapt.  I agree with many of my colleagues that we should work to identify and remove regulations that are no longer relevant. The Critical Infrastructure Protection standards have worked. My amendment ensures that Federal agencies will have the flexibility needed to respond to challenges without sacrificing any other necessary protections.  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Everyone in the Senate knows how they are going to vote on this confirmation. Quite frankly, the President deserves the right to have someone at the CIA whom he trusts and is going to do a good job at a very critical agency. This is a critical component of our national security apparatus. It is unfortunate that the first weekend as President he had to have that position vacant. Nevertheless, that ill will be remedied here in about an hour and a half.  I am proud to stand in support of Congressman Pompeo, whom I got to know well.

As I said earlier, we could have voted on this last Friday, as the Senate Democratic leader had promised the chairman of the Intelligence That word was not kept. Nevertheless, we are here today, and we are going to move forward.  Our new Commander in Chief deserves and needs the Director of the CIA in this job as soon as possible because we face a complex number of dangerous threats, perhaps more than at any time in our recent memory. These include the threat of radical Islamic terrorism--in Iraq, Syria, Southeast Asia, North Africa, even here at home; Russian aggression toward our friends and allies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. We face the savage Assad regime in Syria, which continues to slaughter innocent men, women, and children, targeting civilians in Aleppo and other places. We, of course, face an increasingly unstable dictator in North Korea who continues to develop long-range missiles, soon capable of reaching the west coast of the United States--at least according to his claims. We face an emboldened China which, in pursuing their illegitimate territorial claims in the South China Sea, threatens to destabilize the region. We face Iranian leaders--an Iranian leader who still leads the chant of ``Death to America'' every week as they cheat on the lax requirements of President Obama's flawed nuclear deal. We face illicit trafficking in the Western Hemisphere, right here in our own backyard, that destabilizes governments in the region and floods the streets of our country with narcotics.[[Page S381]]  Quite frankly, Congressman Pompeo's national security experience makes supporting his nomination one of the easiest nomination decisions I have faced in the 6 years and 1 month that I have had the honor of serving the people of Florida in the U.

Here is the kind of world we are now living in, a world that should be of concern to every freedom-loving American, whether you are Democrat or Republican or Independent, conservative or progressive. We are living in a world where government and the private sector often know where you are at any time. They know where you are. They know where you are traveling. They know what books you are reading, what Web sites you are visiting, and maybe the emails you are sending out or reading.  I hear a whole lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate about freedom, about our desire to live and defend a free society. I would ask my colleagues and the American people--when we talk about freedom, one of the attributes of a free society is the right to live our lives the way we want to live our lives, without Big brother knowing everything there is to know about us. You want to do what you want to, it is your business; I want to do what I want to do, it is my business--if we are not harming other people. I believe that is a basic American right and a basic constitutional right, and I want to see people at the CIA, at the NSA, at other intelligence agencies who, yes, will be vigorous about defending us from terrorism but will do it in a way that is constitutional, that protects the civil liberties and the civil rights of the American people.  According to the Pew Internet Project, today 95 percent of American adults own a cell phone. More than three-quarters of American adults own a smartphone. Eighty-eight percent of American adults use the These advancements obviously have enormous advantages. Everybody knows all of the extraordinary things we can do on the Internet and all the information we can gain. It is almost unthinkable that we were living not so many years ago without the advantages of the All of these advantages, all of these conveniences come with a price.  If you have a Google account and the GPS enabled on your phone, Google creates a map for you of every single place you go in a given day. Facebook amasses a massive amount of data on you to better target commercials and advertisements to you. Credit card companies track your spending habits. Even innocuous things like a loyalty program in which you gain benefits by buying at a certain store give the private sector and the government eventually access to a massive amount of information about you.  When you go to the grocery store and scan your card, it is very convenient, moves things faster, and you can get a discount, but the store gets to track everything you purchase. Is that really what want? Do you want the whole world to have knowledge of everything you purchase? For just one rather famous example, Target--a huge chain in America--could tell if a woman was pregnant based on what she was purchasing at the store. Do we really feel comfortable about that kind of information getting out into the private sector or the government sector?[[Page S383]]  If you are wearing a tracking device today to count your steps, to count your heart rate and your sleep patterns, you may see it as a way to become healthier. Your employer or health insurance company, however, may see it as a way to charge you more if you don't meet certain employee wellness targets. Are we really comfortable about corporations knowing all about our health? If you are dealing with a serious illness, maybe it is something you and your family want to keep within the bosom of your family and not spread to the whole world.  That companies are collecting this much information on their own is very troubling to me, but Mr.Pompeo apparently wants to go even further. Last January, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he wrote:       Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all      metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial      and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable      database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance      should be removed.  What we are talking about is the U.Government having, in many ways, more information about us than we may even understand about our own lives. In many ways, it sounds to me that we are moving toward an Orwellian society where, between the government and the private sector, there is very little about ourselves that is not known by somebody else. I am very, very uncomfortable about that.  I want at the head of the CIA somebody who understands thoroughly the Constitution of the United States and privacy rights and understands that we can fight terrorism effectively within the Constitution and the privacy rights guaranteed to the people of our country.  Since June of 2013, here is what we have already learned that the NSA collects: phone call metadata, including the numbers of both parties--my number and the number of the person I call--the location, time, and duration of that telephone call. NSA has access to text messages, email chat, and Internet browsing history, smartphone app data, including map data, which can pinpoint a person's location to within a few yards. They have maps of people's social networks and bank and credit card transactions. That is a lot of information held by the government and/or the private sector on the personal lives of the American people.  As I have mentioned, there is nobody in this Congress who does not understand the threat of terrorism and does not want to see our government be as strong and vigorous as possible in fighting terrorism and getting all the information we need to effectively combat terrorism, to make sure that if somebody is a suspect in terrorist activities, that we go after that person as strongly and as effectively as we can. I believe from the bottom of my heart that we can do that without invading the privacy rights of the American people.  It is not acceptable for Senator after Senator to come here and say we are defending freedom, we live in a free society, and then vote to allow the government or the private sector to have an unbelievable amount of knowledge about each and every one of our personal lives.  Now more than ever, it is vital to have a head of the CIA who will stand up for our Constitution, stand up for privacy rights. Unfortunately, in my view, Mr.Pompeo is not that individual.

I have worked with Senators McCain, Tillis, Leahy, Graham, and so many others here in the Chamber to try to make sure we provide enough visas for those Afghans who are being threatened and who want to come to the United  I wish to point out that the Trump administration, even as it has sharply restricted immigration and refugee programs, has made exceptions for those who served alongside our soldiers and diplomats. In fact, when the administration's original Executive order on immigration was released, there was bipartisan anger that Iraqi interpreters were not protected because this program has served not just those in Afghanistan who have helped us but also those in So the administration recognized its mistake and has made an exception for Iraqi SIV recipients, and now they have exempted Iraq from their Executive order.  It is really past time that we rally renewed support for the Afghan SIV Last week, we learned that the State Department has stopped interviewing applicants for the Afghan program because there are more applicants in the final stages of the process than there are visas. Unless Congress acts, the final visas will be exhausted by the end of It is estimated that more than 10,000 applicants are still in some step of the process of obtaining these visas.  For these Afghans, it really is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death. Interpreters who served the U.mission are being systematically hunted down by the Taliban, and unless Congress acts, this program will lapse and we will abandon these Afghans to a harsh fate.  The United States promised to protect those Afghans who served our mission with great loyalty and at enormous risk, and it would be a stain on our national honor to break this promise. It would also carry profound strategic costs. U.forces and diplomats have always relied on local people to help us accomplish our missions. We continue to require this assistance in Afghanistan, and we will need this support in other places in the future where we face conflict. So we have to ask, if we don't keep our promise, why would anyone agree to help the United States if we abandon those who assist us? This is exactly why the former commander of U.forces in Afghanistan, GEN David Petraeus, and his predecessor, GEN Stanley McChrystal, have pleaded with Congress to extend the Afghan SIV In a letter to Congress last year, more than 30 additional prominent generals, including John Allen, the former commander in Afghanistan, GEN George Casey, the former commander in Iraq, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also urged Congress to extend the program.  In addition, our soldiers and marines are keenly interested in protecting the interpreters who served with them in Many of them owe their lives to the interpreters who went into combat with them. In recent years, I have gotten to know one of those servicemen, a former Army captain, Michael Breen, who is a Granite He served with the infantry in Iraq and led paratroopers in He speaks with admiration about one interpreter in particular who was an Iraqi--part of the Iraqi program--a woman in her early twenties who was named  On one occasion, Captain Breen and his soldiers were at a small forward operating base in He said that a man approached, frantically pointing to his watch and indicating an explosion with his hands. The Americans didn't speak Arabic, so they couldn't tell if the man was trying to warn them or threaten them. Wissam hurried over toward Captain Breen to assist. Wissam was beloved by her American comrades, always cheerful and eager to help.

As Captain Breen later told me, ``A trusted interpreter can be the difference between a successful patrol and a body bag.'' He noted that every night, he and his fellow soldiers would hunker down in their heavily guarded perimeter, but Wissam would leave the compound and go home.

She drew unwelcome attention wherever she went, and she became a high-profile target for the Taliban and others. And then one day in 2013, she got a call at her USAID office. It was from the distraught wife of one of her USAID colleagues, another The caller's husband had just been murdered, apparently in retaliation for his work with the  Realizing that her life was in danger, too, Patmana applied for a special immigrant visa. For 2 years, she and her husband were subjected to repeated interviews at the U.Embassy in Her background was checked and rechecked before visas were finally granted. She told me that they would move frequently. They couldn't stay in one place very long because the Taliban would find them. And she said occasionally there was a knock on her relatives' door, saying ``We know where Patmana is,'' and that would be a signal to move.  She and her husband now live happily in Keene, I am pleased to say her husband has found work as an auditor with a local financial company, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. They are welcomed as valued members of the Keene community and of our larger Granite State family.  The many contributions of these Afghans--both in Afghanistan and now as residents or citizens of the United States--those contributions help explain why senior U.commanders and diplomats have urged Congress to extend the Afghan SIV Our Secretary of Defense, GEN James Mattis, during the confirmation process, said: ``Most of our units could not have accomplished their missions without the assistance, often at the risk of their lives, of these courageous men and women.''

The only thing clever about this bill is the title. Everything else about this bill is truly diabolical. The SCRUB Act isn't going to clean anything up. Its toxic suds will just make people sicker, our environment dirtier, and our products more dangerous.  Creating an unelected commission to oversee the entire regulatory policy of the United States is undemocratic and unimaginably damaging.

1830,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, I wish to start my remarks by saying I have tremendous respect for anybody who will go through the process of confirmation. It is a tough, rigorous process, but it is a process that is very important to this country. The Senate needs to confirm the nominees, and we need to do our work as Senators to make sure the people in the positions in the Cabinet are well-suited to those positions.  In that regard, I am going to rise today in opposition to the nomination of Mike Pompeo to lead the Central Intelligence  As our Nation's top intelligence agency, the CIA plays a critical role in keeping our country safe from those who want to do us harm, but Mr.Pompeo envisions American intelligence-gathering that does much more than keep us safe from our adversaries. He wants to collect the private information of law-abiding citizens. Mr.Pompeo has advocated for reestablishing bulk metadata collection, combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a searchable, comprehensive database.  That might sound fine, but it isn't. What this means is that a phone call with your friend or coworker could be a conversation tracked by the U.That is not right. What this means is that a kid from Lewistown, MT, who is attending college in Bozeman and feels homesick and wants to call home on a Sunday afternoon, that could be tracked. Look, he is not a threat to our country. A grandmother calling her grandkids on their birthday to wish them happy birthday, that could be a tracked. It is not a threat to our country.  This type of bulk data collection Mr.Pompeo advocates for fails to protect our right to privacy and potentially treats innocent Americans like hostile actors. The threats we face in this world are real, but we cannot afford to revive and expand some of the worst elements of the PATRIOT Every American has a fundamental right to privacy, and Mr.Pompeo has indicated he is willing to sacrifice that right. The President deserves to have the guy in office whom he wants, but we can't allow a person to be in office that is going to take away our privacy, take away our civil liberties.  It has been pointed out on this floor before all the bad people out there--in North Korea, in China, in Iran, in Syria, in Let me be clear.

1828,topic-id,1041,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the confirmation of Congressman Mike Pompeo as Director of the Central Intelligence I respect Congressman Pompeo's background and service to our However, I strongly believe that his positions on at least three key issues undermine his qualifications to lead the Central Intelligence  First, he has supported broad surveillance programs that allow the government to spy on the American people--programs that were far-reaching, invasive, and violated law-abiding citizens' constitutional rights to privacy.  These programs were hastily passed as a part of the PATRIOT Act in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I was one of only 66 Members in the House of Representatives to vote against the PATRIOT  Since then, we have learned through reviews by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, as well as the unauthorized disclosure of programs by Edward Snowden, that these programs did go too far. There is no doubt about it. They did go too far.  The government collected massive amounts of personal cell phone information, with no probable or reasonable cause to justify the collection, and the PATRIOT Act was used to obtain hotel records, car rental records, apartment leasing records, credit card records, and other personal information. While the government collected personal information from innocent Americans, there is no credible evidence that it made us more secure.  The majority of the American people opposed the surveillance program. They understood it went too far and violated our basic American right to privacy. So Congress responded and passed the USA FREEDOM Act--bipartisan legislation to rein in the surveillance programs.  Congressman Pompeo was skeptical of the USA FREEDOM Act, and he introduced his own bill to resume and expand the spying programs.  I believe in strong national security, and I have consistently supported our[[Page S380]]military and our National Labs to ensure that we have the strongest and most effective defense in the world. However, in the United States of America, we protect national security and our constitutional rights. The United States is not a police The U.Constitution protects us from overreaching invasions of our privacy. Congress struck an appropriate balance in the USA FREEDOM Act between security and civil liberties. I hope the new administration will not try to return to mass surveillance programs that don't work, aren't supported by the American people, and invade our civil liberties.  Second, Congressman Pompeo's views on torture are deeply concerning. He has stated that the so-called enhanced interrogation programs used by the CIA in the Bush administration ``were within the law'' and ``within the Constitution.'' That is his quote, ``were within the law'' and ``within the Constitution.'' They were not. They violated Federal law prohibiting torture, and they violated the U.Convention on Torture and the Geneva Conventions--treaties the United States signed and that became Federal law. Programs of torture were a stain on our Nation's history and contrary to our value as  Beyond the legality of these programs, any CIA Director must understand that the use of torture is ineffective. It yields bad intelligence, which makes it harder for our analysts to do their jobs. The Senate Intelligence Committee's 6,000-page classified report, issued in December 2014, concludes: ``The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.'' This finding is from the publicly available executive summary from the report.  On key national security issues, like the use of torture, the new administration's top appointees must speak with one voice. Secretary of Defense Mattis has disavowed the use of torture. His many years of experience, training, and leading troops have taught him that torture does not work. Americans go to war--and risk and sacrifice their lives--to preserve our deeply held values. We cannot be engaged in conduct antithetical to those values at the same time. We must lead by example.  Finally, if America uses torture, we have no moral authority to stop foreign countries or terrorists from torturing We can never give implicit license to others to brutalize our soldiers. President Obama banned the use of torture in 2009. Again, I hope we will not be forced into debate about whether to return to the use of inhumane interrogation techniques that don't work and that undermine what we stand for as a nation.  Third, Congressman Pompeo has expressed that the Guantanamo Bay detention center should remain open, and he has said he believes detainees can be imprisoned indefinitely. The continued use of Guantanamo Bay prison and indefinite detention are at odds with our Nation's commitment to human rights and rule of law. There is no place in America's traditions under the Constitution and under international norms for indefinite detention without trial or adjudication. Guantanamo Bay hurts America's standing around the world, it is a recruiting tool for terrorists, and it is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. Again, we must strike an appropriate balance between national security and America's fundamental principles. We cannot take actions to preserve American values that at the same time are opposite those very same values.  Finally, Congressman Pompeo's views on Muslims are troubling. He has stated that Muslim leaders are ``potentially complicit'' in acts of terrorism if they don't condemn it. Muslim leaders around the world have condemned extremists' violence. Muslims around the world strongly condemn such acts. Accusing Muslim leaders of complicity and acts of terrorism that they have nothing to do with, that they oppose, is not acceptable speech from a Director of a national security agency.  In conclusion, I want to underscore that I have nothing but respect for the men and women who work in the Central Intelligence They are true patriots who work hard every day, at personal risk, to keep our Nation secure. These patriots deserve a leader who will keep our Nation secure and secure our Nation's basic values.  In defense of America, in the name of national security, we must protect Americans' constitutional rights, the rule of law, and human rights. I believe Congressman Pompeo's views do not hold with American values. His positions will not keep America safe. I think they could undermine our security. For these reasons, I must oppose Congressman Pompeo's nomination as Director of the Central Intelligence  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1789,topic-id,288,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.511. I would note that this is our colleague Mr.Welch's bill that moved through the regular process through the Committee on Energy and Commerce last year. It received extensive bipartisan support. I am again glad to move this bill today.  External power supplies, EPS, are used with a wide variety of devices, and we have learned from experience that the Federal energy efficiency standards for them are not compatible with some of these applications. In particular, we need an exemption from these rules for security and life safety alarms and surveillance systems. This bill, H.511, the Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act, provides a targeted exemption that allows these critical systems to stay on the market.  Devices like home security alarms or fire detection systems need to be on 24/7, but the 2007 energy law requiring energy efficiency standards for external power supplies did not allow for this. Subsequent legislation created an exemption for external power supplies used with these always-on devices. This exemption will end on July 1 of this year. This bill extends that exemption until 2023.  The result of the bill would be that these important security systems will continue to be available, preserving the jobs of those who make them and certainly the safety of those who use them.

One of the people who does that most, specifically in the area of poverty initiatives, who reaches acrosscommunity lines, reaches across party lines is the gentleman from Kentucky, my good friend, Representative Andy Barr fromI yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Barr).

Mr.Speaker, there are a couple of numbers I would like to share that puts it a little bit in the context of what we aredealing with here. Seventy-five percent of co-ops have failed. In five States, Americans are down to just one option. The greatthing about our country's history is that we have choices. We have decisions. Yet, since the takeover of this administrationover health care, those choices have continued to reduce. Sometimes you may hear Congress this or Congress that. One of the neatthings about Congress is the amount of people coming from diverse backgrounds.

Infact, even in the press conference today, President-elect Trump said that, if we did nothing, it would continue to fail. But wehave an obligation to stand up and do what is right.  We can't do nothing. People are suffering--in fact, suffering to the place that even recently a couple months ago a MinnesotaGovernor was honest enough to talk about how it has damaged small business.

If youthink back 6, 7, even 8 years ago, even part of the original campaign talking about the Affordable Care Act, this ObamaCare, wethink about three promises--we have all heard them--you can keep your doctor, you can keep your healthcare plan, and premiums aregoing down. Specifically one that stands out more was the premiums going down $2,500.  My Democratic friends want to ignore some of those numbers, but here are the facts: In 2014, premiums increased across theboard 37 percent; 2015, again, last year, 25 percent. In fact, in some States, it is out of sight. In my home State of NorthCarolina, it is 40 percent. But in some places, in Arizona, it is as high as 116 percent.

2054,topic-id,677,"I thank I appreciate that spirited, heartfelt talk. In my previous vocation, we would usuallycall for an invitation at about this time.  Mr.Speaker, this is not just a problem in red States; this is a problem in blue States, like it is with my good friend fromthe First District of California, Representative Doug LaMalfa, to whom I yield as he shares a little bit of his heart whenit comes to ObamaCare and the repeal.  Mr.I really want to thank Chairman Walker of the RSC, the Republican Study I greatlyappreciate the gentleman's leadership on this event here tonight as well as the great job the gentleman is doing on the Mr.Speaker, we have had alternatives to the Affordable Care Act ever since I have been here. The American Health CareReform Act, as put forward by the Republican Study Committee, has many of the elements we have all been talking about forseveral years: with the Affordable Care Act being forced upon Americans not in a bipartisan effort but strictly by the votes ofone party when they had the majority--the ability--to force it[[Page H379]]through. We are suffering the effects of that now.  One of my colleagues earlier was talking about: Why isn't this being reported? Why isn't this being talked about in thebroad sense of how it is really affecting the Americans who are paying for it?  People in my district, ever since I have been a Member of this House, have been pleading with us to do something about thesehigh premiums, about the high deductibles, about the lack of access they have, especially in rural areas. Why are the proponentscontinuing to prop this up? It is clear that it doesn't work: higher costs, fewer options, unworkable plans. The exchanges--wehave watched in several States--most of them, after billions in investment, are shuttering; they are closing up shop. Where dothose billions go that we have invested as a country into these exchanges?                              {time}  1945  But on a patient level, it is putting even more of our most vulnerable patients on a system already known to beunsustainable without even ensuring access to quality care. In some cases, no care at all.  How are people defining that as a success?  We know that the main reason why so many people are uninsured is the high cost of coverage. But instead of investing vastamounts of money to bring more people into a broken system, let's take this opportunity to start fixing the root of the problem.  One, this is done by increasing competition, giving patients more options, choices. Mr.Speaker, give them a menu of optionsthey can pick themselves, tailor the plan to what they need. A 20-year-old young man has a completely different need than a 30-year-old mom and her family. Let them have the choices.  Also, let's get rid of the costly mandates, the taxes. There are taxes on everything, it seems, to help prop up ObamaCare,the Affordable Care Act, including the cost for students for college. They are paying for some of that.  Then let's build off successes that we have seen in the past and that are part of the proposal of the Republican StudyCommittee and the American Healthcare Reform That could help fill our gaps in the healthcare delivery system.  Community health centers, for example, is a model that is both cost effective and efficient in expanding access to careservices in underserved areas, very rural ones, such as my own district at home.  Healthcare reform affects the lives of every single person in this country, which is why it is high time that we put thehealth and well-being of the American people ahead of partisan politics and legacies.  Let's get to work and deliver actual solutions that empower patients, drive down the costs, and increase access to care inevery part of the country. Let's give back to Americans: ``Keep your plan that you like, keep your doctor that you like.''  So it is time to stop the partisan squabbling over it and the deception that has gone on for what is indeed for some a badlegacy of the American people.

1820,topic-id,777,"Mr.President, before my friend, the Senator from Texas, leaves, I am sure he understands that I am rising now in support of the nomination of Congressman Mike Pompeo to be Director of the Central Intelligence But before I speak on the nominee, I do want to take a moment to address the criticism that has been leveled against my colleagues who asked for time to debate the nomination.  As Members of the U.Senate, we are responsible to the American people to make measured, thoughtful decisions. I will support this nomination, but, again, I fully respect the right of my colleagues to ask for time to debate the nomination on its merits. I know Senator Wyden and others will be coming to the floor later today to address their issues.  To be clear at the outset, I do not agree with some of the views that Congressman Pompeo has expressed, and our personal and political views are wildly divergent. While Congressman Pompeo and I disagree on many issues, I believe he can be an effective leader of the  In our private discussions, and in the open and closed hearings, he has convinced me that he will follow the law banning torture. And let me be clear. As the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I will oppose any effort to change law or policy to once again torture detainees, and I will keep a careful watch to ensure that no one ever tries to do so again.  I have also received public and private assurances from Congressman Pompeo that he will accurately represent the unvarnished views of the analysts and folks who work for the CIA and that he will relay those views no matter what the President or others want to hear.  One of the most important jobs of the Intelligence Committee is speaking truth to power.  Congressman Pompeo has also given me assurances that he will support those who work for the CIA and not discriminate against anyone based on their personal views and, not in the least, that he will cooperate with Congress, particularly as we look into Russia's efforts to interfere with our election system.  I heard my friend, the Senator from Texas, call out the former Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, who has over 50 years in the intelligence business. And again, Mr.Clapper, along with all the other leaders of the intelligence community, basically has said that the Russian efforts to interfere in our elections in this past year were unprecedented.  We all know that President Trump has said some unacceptable things about the intelligence community, accusing them of leaks and of politicizing intelligence. Those of us who serve on the Select Committee on Intelligence--indeed, all of us in Congress, and I know I see my friend, the chairman of the committee, is sitting here on the floor--know that those attacks were unwarranted and should not be continued.  Congressman Pompeo did not participate in those attacks. Instead, throughout his tenure on the House Intelligence Committee, he showed respect for the intelligence community and worked to help make them even better.  His former colleagues and staff on the committee speak highly of him, even when they disagree.  Since he was nominated for the position of Director, Mr.Pompeo has spent a great deal of time at the CIA, working with the professionals there to understand his new role and the challenges he will face. We have had a number of conversations about that.  I have heard nothing that undermines my view that he will treat the employees of the Agency with the decency and fairness they deserve. And since most of those employees also happen to be my constituents, I will watch his actions very carefully.  Under Congressman Pompeo, the CIA will face many challenges. For example, the growth of open source information and big data will supplement and challenge traditional collection means. The Agency has the increasing need to operate in expeditionary and nontraditional environments, which will drive a need for changes in personnel, support, and training. The Agency will have and will need an increasingly diverse workforce which grew up online, which will create new opportunities but also new problems, for example, in establishing and maintaining cover. And if he is confirmed as Director, Mr.Pompeo will have to complete and sometimes tweak the reorganization begun by his predecessor, John  While Congressman Pompeo and I disagree on many issues--and I suspect will disagree on many in the future--I support his nomination.

1824,topic-id,3711,"Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I want to thank Senator Leahy, particularly because, once again, on this issue he showed there was a path forward that was bipartisan. The senior Senator from Vermont got together with our colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, and the two of them set out from the get-go to try to find common ground.  I think most people didn't give us great odds. Senator Leahy and I used to talk about how when we began the effort, being on the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, a group of us could probably have met in a phone booth, but then, under Senator Leahy's leadership, we began to pick up colleagues from both sides of the aisle.  The Obama administration, which we both remember, had reservations at the beginning. We said: Look, we can find a way. The intelligence community said to go forward with this, but this didn't happen by osmosis. It happened under the leadership of Senator Leahy and Senator Lee, our colleague on the other side of the aisle. One of the reasons we feel so strongly, as the Senator from Vermont has stated, is that if we are not careful, particularly with this nomination, we could undo, we could unravel a lot of that good bipartisan work.  I know my colleague has a tight schedule, and I so appreciate his coming over and very much recognize that one of the reasons we are here is to make sure we don't undo the good bipartisan work that he has authored.  Madam President, today the Senate is doing something that doesn't happen often around here--having an open debate about the future of the Central Intelligence The Central Intelligence Agency, in my view, is an enormously important and valuable part of our government. It is staffed by thousands and thousands of patriotic Americans who make extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf. They work so hard to protect our country in so many ways Americans will never find out about. They give up their time. They give up their weekends, family vacations, and all kinds of things that would be scheduled that they would enjoy personally, and they give it up on 1 or 2 hours' worth of notice because they want to protect the security and the well-being of our The fact is, many at the CIA have risked their lives defending us and some have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives.  When you talk about the CIA on the Senate floor, it is especially important to protect the people I have just mentioned and to protect what are called their sources and methods. Sources and methods are the secret means by which the CIA gets the information that is needed for our national security, and it needs to stay classified. While sources and methods need to stay classified, the debate about our laws and those who execute them is a public matter. The policies that guide what the CIA does in its important work--the debate about policies always has to be public. The nomination of a CIA Director is a rare and important chance to talk about what the nominee thinks those policies ought to be.  In the beginning, I am going to offer my guiding principle. Smart national security policies protect both our security and our liberty, and they recognize that security and liberty are not mutually exclusive; that it is possible to have both; that it is essential to have both. Nothing illustrates the need for policies that promote security and liberty more clearly than the issue of encryption, which we will be talking about--in my view--at length in this Congress as part of the intelligence debate.  Strong encryption protects Americans from foreign hackers, criminals, identity thieves, stalkers, and other bad actors. It is the key to protecting our cyber security. Yet there are some in government and some in the Congress who think it would make sense to require American companies to build backdoors into their products so the government can get access to that information. My own view is this would be an enormous mistake, a mistake from a security standpoint, a mistake from a liberty standpoint, and also very damaging to our companies--companies that produce jobs with good wages. I have been fighting against ill-advised encryption proposals because they would be bad for security for the reason I mentioned. It would be a big gift to foreign hackers and bad for liberty. The reality is, if we require our companies to build backdoors into their products, the first thing that is going to happen is all the companies overseas, where they will not have such rules, will benefit enormously. A lot of good-paying jobs--high-skill, high-wage jobs--would be at risk. I bring this up only by way of stressing how important it is that we get this right; that we advance policies that promote security and liberty and we recognize right at the get-go that they are not mutually exclusive.  With that in mind, we turn to the nomination of Congressman Mike Pompeo to be the Director of the Central Intelligence After consideration of his testimony and a review of his past statements--and response to written questions--I have concluded that he is the wrong man for the job. He has endorsed extreme policies that would fundamentally erode the liberties and freedoms of our people without making us safer. He has been unwilling to provide meaningful responses to my questions with respect to these views. When he has provided responses, they have often either been so vague or so contradictory that it is impossible to determine what his core beliefs are or what he might actually do if he is confirmed.  On issue after issue, the Congressman has taken two, three, or four positions, depending on when he says it and whom he is talking to. He has done this with surveillance, with torture, with Russia, and a number of other subjects. So now we are at the end of the confirmation process. There has been a hearing. I met with the nominee in private. We submitted two sets of questions, both before and after the hearing. Despite it all, it has been impossible to walk away with consistent answers on the Congressman's beliefs on how he would lead the Central Intelligence  Let me begin with surveillance. Just over a year ago, after the USA FREEDOM Act had become law, Congressman Pompeo wrote in an op-ed that Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all metadata. This was a reference to the program in which the government collected and kept the records of tens of millions of innocent When the American people found out about this program, they were rightly horrified and they rejected it, which was why--as we touched on this afternoon on a bipartisan basis--Congress abolished the program through the USA FREEDOM That law got the government out of the business of collecting these millions of phone records on law-abiding people, and it did nothing to harm our security. For example, I am very proud that I was able to work in a bipartisan way to author a provision that allowed the government, in emergency circumstances, to get phone records immediately and then go back later and seek court approval. I wrote that provision to make sure that when the security of our great Nation was on the line, it would be possible for our national security officials to move immediately, without delay, to get the information that was needed. Congressman Pompeo himself voted for the USA FREEDOM Act before he turned around 8 months later and wrote that he wanted to reestablish this sweeping and unnecessary program. So understand the timeline. The Congressman talks about voting for the USA FREEDOM Act, but after he cast that vote, he came out in a widely circulated article in the Wall Street Journal for a proposal that really makes all the earlier collection of phone records about law-abiding people look like small potatoes. I am going to discuss that this afternoon.  The question really is, What does the Congressman believe? Does he stand by his vote to abolish the NSA phone records dragnet? Was that what he was suggesting when he brought up that vote during his hearing or does he stand by what he wrote in his major opinion article that came out well after the law he voted for? In response to questions, the Congressman wrote[[Page S374]]that he believes the collection of tens of millions of Americans' phone records provided a significant tool for the intelligence community and that ``I have not changed my position.'' That sounds like an endorsement of the mass surveillance of phone records.  Again, in the hearing, the nominee said something else. Senator Heinrich asked him whether he had been briefed on whether the current process--where the government collects phone records on an individual basis rather than in bulk from millions of Americans, even if they are not suspected of a crime--protects our Nation as well as the liberty of millions of innocent The Congressman is a member of the House Intelligence Committee so he has had the opportunity to be briefed on this topic, but here is his response to Senator Heinrich: ``Senator, I have not had a chance to have a complete briefing on that, but I can say I have not heard anything that suggests that there is a need for change today.'' In other words, in just a matter of days, Congressman Pompeo has taken the position, first, that the bulk collection of American phone records was a significant tool and that it should be reestablished, and, second, while testifying to the committee, that he has no basis on which to believe that is necessary. That is such a head scratcher, I just don't know how to go about squaring these truly conflicting statements.  What troubles me especially is if the Congressman were to be confirmed as CIA Director, the doors would close and he would operate in secret. Yet Americans do not know which position he would take in running the The American people have no idea how Congressman Pompeo would advise the President and his national security team on what is truly necessary to protect the  Phone records are not the only communication records we need to be concerned about. Until a few years ago, the NSA also ran a program in which millions of Americans' email records were collected. Since the Congressman wrote that he wanted to reestablish collecting all of the metadata, I asked him whether he would support the resumption of that program as well and whether he believed that millions of Americans' email records should be combined with millions of American phone records. He could have said no. He could have clarified that he was only talking about phone records. Instead, he ducked taking a position. In fact, he even indicated that he would be open to including email records in his new database. His exact words were: ``If I am confirmed and agency officials inform me that they believe the current programs and legal framework are insufficient to protect the country, I would make appropriate recommendations for any needed changes to laws and regulations.''  What is especially troubling about this is that the bulk email program was discontinued because it wasn't effective. I spent a lot of time pressing intelligence officials to give us some evidence that you had to go out and collect all of these email records from law-abiding In the end, the Agency decided to look at it, and they came to the same conclusion I did; that it wasn't needed. That is not a judgment about whether the program violated Americans' privacy because it definitely did that. The NSA determined that--in its words, not mine--the program did not meet their ``operational expectations.'' This is public information. All the details are available to the House Intelligence Committee on which the Congressman sits. This should have been an easy answer for the nominee, but he refused to rule out the inclusion of millions of Americans' email records--records the NSA has said it doesn't need--in what would be his idea of a massive new government database.  The collection of phone and email records of millions of innocent Americans is small potatoes compared to what the nominee wrote next. His proposal was to combine all of the communications metadata, and these are his words, with ``publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive searchable data base.'' This is far bigger and more encompassing than any such data collection program that the Bush-Cheney administration ever imagined.  I have been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee since before 9/11. I have been in a lot of debates about the appropriate scope of government surveillance. I have never heard ever--not from anyone--an idea so extreme, so overarching, and so intrusive on Americans' privacy. I wanted to give the Congressman the opportunity to explain what he was actually proposing. So during the confirmation hearing--and later in what are questions that are submitted to him--I tried to find out what his database would include and what, if anything, it wouldn't include. I could not get substantive answers. What we basically got was a big word salad with a liberal helping of words that just kind of skirted the issue. My folks would call them weasel words.  The Congressman did mention social media in his answers. But it is one thing for the government to read the social media postings of Americans because there is a specific reason to do so; it is something else entirely to create a giant government database of everyone's social media postings and to match that up with everyone's phone records. We asked where the nominee would draw the line. He wouldn't say.  Congressman Pompeo's vision of this vast government database doesn't stop, by the way, with social media. What he wrote in his responses to my questions was that he was ``generally'' referring to publicly available information on the Internet or other ``public databases.'' I will repeat that. He was generally talking about information already in the public domain. That raised the question of what else the nominee wanted to enter into a giant government database of information on millions of innocent For example, did he have in mind information on Americans that the government could obtain or purchase from third parties, such as data brokers who collect information on the purchasing history of our people? Imagine putting every American's purchases into a government database, along with their social media postings and all of their phone records.  After two rounds of submitted questions and a hearing, it was not clear what the Congressman meant when he referred to ``all metadata'' or how he defined ``publicly available financial and lifestyle information.'' What we do know for sure is that he wouldn't give us any real sense of what he wanted to do with this proposal. He was unwilling to talk about it.  The responses I got from the Congressman on this and other topics generally fell into three categories. The first was, I will do what is legal. The second one was, when it comes to Americans' privacy, that is the FBI's problem, not the CIA's. And third, as CIA Director, I won't do policy. I am going to briefly state why these are unacceptable answers.  First, I asked the Congressman if there were any boundaries to his proposed new, vast database on His response was, ``Of course there are boundaries; any collection and retention must be conducted in accordance with the Constitution, statutes, and applicable presidential directives.'' That is not a response. Just because the government may be able to legally obtain information on Americans on an individualized or limited basis doesn't necessarily make it legal, much less appropriate, to create this vast database with all kinds of information on law-abiding If you take his response to mean that the only boundaries are those established by law, then it is worth considering how the intelligence community has frequently interpreted the legal limits in which it operates: flexibly and in secret.  Even if we imagine that there are established legal boundaries that would rein in the Congressman's CIA, consider what he himself has said about those legal boundaries. He wrote in his op-ed--and these are his words, not mine--that ``legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.'' It is also significant that throughout his response to questions, he refers to CIA policies, procedures, and regulations. As CIA Director, he would be in a position to change those.  It seems to me that the Congressman can't have it both ways--he can't say he is bound only by legal restrictions and avoid saying what he thinks those restrictions should be.  The nominee's second way to avoid answering these questions was by arguing that concerns about the privacy of[[Page S375]]Americans are the business of the FBI, not the That is just not the case. There is a long and unfortunate history related to the CIA and domestic intelligence, which the Church Committee documented in the 1970s. I will be clear--I don't believe the CIA is up to anything like this today, but the possibility of returning to those days is certainly a possibility if the Director of the CIA takes the flexible approach to the rules that are intended to keep the CIA out of the lives of American citizens. I will give just a few examples.  On January 3, the Director of National Intelligence put out new procedures about the distribution within the intelligence community of what is called raw signals intelligence. These are the actual content of communications, as opposed to an analyst's report about these communications. According to the new procedures, these communications can be provided to the CIA if the CIA Director asks for them and explains to the NSA why the CIA needs them.  Here is why this matters to the privacy of Americans: When raw communications are distributed to the CIA, they include the communications of Americans that have been sucked up in the overall collection. So at this point, the CIA would have these communications. According to the new procedures, in some instances the Director of the CIA can approve CIA searches of that data for the communications of The Director of the CIA can also approve the use of Americans' communications. The question is, How would the Congressman exercise these authorities? We just don't know.  Another example would be the CIA's own procedures for dealing with information on Last week, the CIA updated these procedures in a 41-page public document. They covered, for example, the CIA's collection of vast amounts of information that includes the communications of or information about Americans--what can be collected by the CIA, what can be kept by the CIA, what can be distributed by the The new procedures also cover when CIA officers are required and when they are not required to identify themselves when participating in organizations in our country.  Just reading these procedures makes it clear that the CIA's activities bump up against the liberties of Americans all the time. That is why the regulations exist. But if a CIA Director has extreme views with regard to the liberties and freedoms of our people, that could very well be reflected in how the Agency implements these procedures or whether they get rewritten. How would the Congressman apply these rules? Would he propose new ones to make it easier for the CIA to look at more information about Americans? Again, we just don't know.  One thing is clear: The views of the CIA Director about the liberties and freedoms of Americans are just as relevant as those of the FBI  The nominee's third effort to avoid discussing his position was to say that as the CIA Director, he wouldn't be responsible for policy. As he asserted in his opening statement at the hearing, he would ``change roles from policymaker to information provider.'' But anyone who is familiar with the role of the CIA Director knows that is just not what happens at the  First, the CIA Director does far more than deliver analysis to government officials. Collection priorities, methods of collection, relationships with foreign services, covert action, and many other responsibilities of the office are policy matters.  In addition, the CIA Director and other leaders of the intelligence community are asked repeatedly what they think is necessary and appropriate to keep our Nation safe. At a moment of crisis, these questions are especially pressing. We now know what happens in those moments when leaders give wrong answers. After September 11, the Directors of the NSA and the CIA offered their views of what should be done. We all thought they had time stamps on them because we came back to look at them after the immediate crisis was over, but our country ended up for a fair amount of time with programs that ripped at the very fabric of our democracy. There were warrantless wiretappings and torture.  The Director of the CIA is a unique position. When someone is nominated to lead a department that operates more or less openly, at least the public can assess his or her performance, and at least a fully-informed Congress can respond when he or she implements wrongheaded policies. But the CIA Director operates in secret. What the public finds out is entirely up to the CIA and the administration.  When it comes to deciding whether this is the right person for the job, there is nothing for the public and most of the Congress to go on other than what the nominee has said and done before and during the confirmation process. Unless this is going to be a rare exception and the Congressman would be a historically transparent CIA Director--and there aren't any indications of that--then what we are talking about in this confirmation debate today and why I thought it was important to have a real debate today is that what we are talking about in terms of much of the future of the CIA and the person who heads it--this is a one-time shot for that discussion. That is why I don't consider the vetting process to be finished.  (",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS369-4.txt,1247,1900,2017.0,23.0,January

1840,topic-id,413,"Mr.President, I want to be very brief. I know colleagues are facing tough weather and are trying to deal with the logistics of all that. I just want to close with a couple of points.  The first is that I have heard several of my colleagues say to me that a central reason for voting for Congressman Pompeo this afternoon is that they have said that he voted for the USA FREEDOM That is correct. The problem is that just a few months after he cast that vote, the Congressman turned around and said he wanted to reestablish the bulk phone record program in a way that was vastly more encompassing and way more intrusive than the USA FREEDOM Act abolished. What he was proposing after he voted for the USA FREEDOM Act, which says that Congress says you ought to have limits, was a bulk metadata program that was way beyond anything that the Bush-Cheney administration ever imagined.  I have been on the Senate Intelligence Committee since before September 11. I have been in the middle of countless debates about the appropriate scope of government surveillance, but I have never heard--not from anyone--an idea that was so extreme and so overreaching and so intrusive of Americans' privacy. I bring this up only by way of saying that, if confirmed, the nominee is going to be dealing with a whole host of issues that, if we really think it through carefully and thoughtfully, we can find a way to ensure that Americans have security and liberty and that the two are not mutually exclusive. If we do it wrong, which would certainly happen if one were to weaken strong encryption, we will end up with less of both--less security and less liberty.  With respect to the process, I would only say that this matter of the way the Congressman handled his views with respect to surveillance and torture and Russia really reflect how his views change on a major issue, whether it is surveillance or torture or Russia, depending on the time and who he is talking to. I just don't think that ought to be the standard for winning support to head an agency as important as the  I know my colleagues are on a very tight time schedule.

2056,topic-id,533,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Walker) for hosting this Special TheAmerican people have spoken, and it is time. The ACA, the Affordable Care Act--which it is not, and we know that.  I want to take you back, a little history here. Back prior to 2009, before the Affordable Care Act came out, 85 percent ofthe people in America had health insurance either through their employer or on their own. Fifteen percent did not have healthinsurance.  Yet, Congress, in their infinite wisdom, instead of fixing it for the 15 percent and getting them into the pool of peoplethat had health insurance, said: No; we are going to change it. We are going to change it and disrupt the whole healthcaremarket and 20 percent of our economy.  This is the epitome of legislative malpractice. This Congress was controlled by one party, the Democratic Party, through theHouse, the Senate, and the executive branch. They passed a 2,900-page bill at the end of the year that nobody read. You can't dothat in any other business without going to jail.  President Obama sold us a bill of goods on a lie. If you want to keep your doctor or your insurance, you can and your pricewill go down $2,500.  Let me share three real-life stories. One was a 54-year-old man that came into our office, single, making a six-figureincome, could afford insurance. He was going through the exchange. He changed his plan and wanted to pay for it right then. Theysaid: Don't worry about it, we will send you a bill. They never sent him a bill, and his insurance got canceled. He could notbuy insurance because it was through the exchange and the sign-up period had expired. He got fined whatever the fine was. He gotfined trying to do the right thing.  Another one is a friend of mine who owns a restaurant franchise. He has 500 employees. He says: I can't afford to pay forthe health insurance. So he moved people from working 32 or 40 hours a week down to 26 hours.  I could tell you a real personal story about a couple I know real well. They came to Their policy got canceled.Their premiums went up by over $11,000. Their deductibles went up and their coverage went down. I know that couple real wellbecause it is my wife and myself.  The American people have spoken and given us the majority for a reason, and that is to fix health care and allow the besthealthcare providers, the best medicine, the best research and the institutions in America to provide that for all Americans anddeliver that care to all  The Republican Congress has a better way, and it starts with putting health care back into the hands of the physicians tothe patients.
