 WILL THOSE CHAMPIONING TRUMPCARE TRADE PLACES WITH THOSE WHOM IT HARMS

  (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, since the Republicans in Washington have 
not held a single public hearing on TrumpCare, I asked my constituents 
directly for feedback at a Maine healthcare townhall. Not one of the 
hundreds of constituents spoke in support of the legislation. Instead, 
many said they will be among the millions of Americans who will lose 
their coverage under this bill.
  One of those voices was Ed Saxby of Cape Elizabeth, pictured on the 
board next to me. Ed stood beside his wife and granddaughter as he 
bravely spoke about his own battle with cancer. He said that the odds 
of survival are against him because TrumpCare will take away the tax 
credits he needs to afford healthcare coverage as a retiree living on a 
fixed income.
  Ed's wife, Jill, asked me if those who are championing TrumpCare 
would be willing to trade places with those whom it will harm.
  I pose that question today to my Republican colleagues. If you can't 
answer in the affirmative, you should not be voting for this terrible 
bill.
