                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN MASSICK

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we often hear about the term ``Greatest 
Generation'' in describing the people who endured the Great Depression 
and persevered in World War II. Today I am proud to talk about one of 
those people who is a part of the Greatest Generation, my constituent 
John Massick.
  John was born, quite fittingly, on Veteran's Day in 1915. Last 
November, John celebrated his 101st birthday.
  Mr. Massick enlisted in the Army in 1941, serving the H Company 378th 
Infantry Division. During his time in the Army, John was promoted to 
the rank of sergeant. John served in combat, including multiple battles 
in France during 1944. Mr. Massick's service concluded upon his 
honorable discharge in 1945. He earned several decorations in the line 
of duty, earning the Good Conduct Medal, American Defense Service 
Ribbon, two Bronze Stars, and others.
  After John's discharge from duty, he returned home to Davenport, IA, 
where he still lives. John and his late wife, Velma, raised two boys.
  Our country can't thank Mr. Massick enough for his service. We will 
never truly be able to repay the debt owed to those who put their lives 
on the line in defense of freedom, not just for Americans but for those 
around the world. While I may not ever be able to thank Mr. Massick 
enough for his service, I do hope that shedding light on his incredible 
service may serve as a symbol of this body's gratitude.
