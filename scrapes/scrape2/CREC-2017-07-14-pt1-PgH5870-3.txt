   STRENGTHENING DOD'S RESPONSE TO PFOA AND PFOS WATER CONTAMINATION

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the House Armed Services Committee for working with me to strengthen 
the Defense Department's response to PFOA and PFOS water contamination 
issues.
  These contaminants are plaguing communities due to the use of AFFF 
firefighting foams across our Nation, including in Horsham and Willow 
Grove, Pennsylvania, in my district.
  I have been fighting for Federal resources and responsibility since 
first learning of these issues.
  With my amendment, and the $30 million increases each for the Air 
Force and Navy to combat this issue that we fought so hard for, this 
bill is an important step in the right direction toward addressing this 
issue any and every way we possibly can, but our fight continues.
  My bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3106, would require an enforceable 
nationwide drinking water standard for PFCs, including PFOA and PFOS, 
rather than the current voluntary advisory.
  I will keep fighting to address this issue with the seriousness it 
merits.
