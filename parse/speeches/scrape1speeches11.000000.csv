7890,topic-id,442,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have seen firsthand in my district how disasters devastate communities and their citizens. In the aftermath of these disasters, while facing the devastation and the daunting task of recovery, many communities encounter even more challenges caused by FEMA, which has been sent there to help.  I continue to hear from my colleagues in Congress about conflicting guidance received from FEMA officials, who constantly change on the ground. I have heard stories of lost documents, lengthy delays, and huge administrative burdens placed on communities doing their best to recover from disasters. And in the worst cases, the guidance provided by FEMA results in the community losing disaster assistance.  Unfortunately, in Missouri, they have faced many of these challenges following floods in August 2013. Congresswoman Hartzler has taken the lead to push FEMA to fix these issues by introducing this bill. I am proud that we are moving H.1117.  One of my focuses as chair of the subcommittee is how we can make disaster assistance programs more effective and efficient and ensure the wise investment of taxpayer dollars. H.1117 will certainly help us do that.  This legislation helps communities struggling to recover from disasters by improving transparency, consistency, and communication with It also requires FEMA to leverage technologies to ease the administrative burden on local governments for maintaining documents, applying for assistance, and providing information to FEMA to speed recovery. The House adopted similar language last year when it passed the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform  Again, I commend the gentlewoman from Missouri for introducing this bill to ensure that those impacted by disasters are receiving accurate, up-to-date information about their assistance and the status of recovery.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1117 to require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to submit a report on how it will improve field staff transition.  As the gentleman from Pennsylvania has explained, there has been a good deal of confusion with high turnover, repetitive and lost paperwork, and inconsistent guidance.  FEMA has implemented several new technologies to manage its full-time employees, but they have not made similar efforts for field and temporary disaster response personnel. It is time for FEMA to do so.  This bill requires FEMA to submit a report on how it plans to address the disaster workforce issues, their continuing inconsistent guidance, and keeping appropriate records.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgH2448-4.txt,2054,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,27.0,February

Both bills address the critical issue of the U.working with developing economies on the core issue of information technology and cybersecurity.  In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the information technology sector has literally taken off and enabled young, innovative, and talented entrepreneurs to develop IT-related solutions to everyday problems.  Last summer, I traveled with Senator Markey and Representative Maloney to Nigeria and Senegal where we met with a number of local IT experts. What was clear from our in-depth discussions is that Internet access has quickly become a critical component of economies and economic growth throughout the developing world.  Many developing economies, which have traditionally had to navigate institutional or infrastructural impediments, are able to utilize information technology to resolve everyday problems. Case in point, telephone land lines in some developing economies are often in need of constant repair and maintenance. As a result, over the years, land lines became the preserve of the middle class and affluent sectors of capital cities.  This is no longer the case because astute entrepreneurs have found a way to circumvent this impediment by buying and/or renting out cell phones for public use. Today, in just about any country you visit in Sub-Saharan Africa, you will see countless men, women, and children using cell phones.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

You just have to believe in the Tenth  Despite the histrionics you may hear on the other side of the aisle today, with today's resolution, we are not, we are not, one, voting to defund Planned Parenthood in any way, shape, or form; we are not voting to cut title X funding; and we are not voting to restrict abortion rights.

It shouldn't be, because that is how the title X grant program functioned for more than 45 years, until the Obama administration decided to leave this parting gift to abortion industry on its way out the door.  For me, this is a personal issue. As a registered nurse, I know that vulnerable women seeking true comprehensive care deserve better than abortion-centric facilities like Planned So, as a State legislator, I worked within my authority to make sure that Tennessee honored the will of[[Page H1269]]our pro-life populace and steered our State's share of title X dollars away from healthcare providers that performed abortion.  As a result, our share of title X grants have been sent exclusively to the Tennessee Department of Health, which then allocates them to the county health departments and other qualified providers that protect the lives of the most vulnerable. That was Tennessee's right, and it has been able to exercise that right while protecting access to comprehensive care for those who are most in need.  As a matter of fact, according to HHS' own 2015 title X Family Planning Annual Report, our State provided care under title X to more than 75,000 That means that we served even more citizens than the more populated States like Michigan and  But in December of last year, the Obama administration decided to intervene, setting unprecedented new parameters on how States must select title X grantees that were specifically designed to prop up its political allies in the abortion industry.

This resolution empowers It empowers States that are able to choose to invest in women's health care over abortion by sending those title X dollars to clinics that do not destroy innocent life. My colleagues on the other side talked about how this is destructive to women's health. I want to just mention that the true destruction to women's health is abortion. That is the little girl who is aborted that will never know about being a woman.  This bill does nothing to prohibit States from deciding where to best use their dollars, but in States such as mine in Tennessee for the last 6 years, who have made that decision to send their dollars to facilities that they believe give the best women's health care, comprehensive health care, to over 75,000 women in our State, more than many States that surround us that have larger populations.  If this were prohibiting women from getting services, we wouldn't be so successful with providing services to more than 75,000 women in our We haven't seen a decrease in services. We have seen an increase in services. If you were to ask these women what they thought about services that they are getting in these other facilities such as Department of Health and federally qualified health centers, you would see they are very satisfied because they get comprehensive services that go beyond what places like Planned Parenthood can even provide for them. They do mammograms, they do procedures if there are cancer cells found in a woman's cervix.  So this whole ruse that this is a war on women and that we are taking away women's right to healthcare services is a ruse. All this does is to say, if a State like Tennessee decides this is the best place to give the best quality of care for a woman, and hopefully their babies and their children--which, if you go to these clinics, you will see them all running around, they have life--it just gives them the choice to do that.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell: Thank you      for your strong, principled and common-sense leadership on      the issue of preventing American tax dollars from funding      abortion on demand. Thank you also for your commitment to      providing healthcare access to the poor and other vulnerable      patients in need.       On behalf of the over 18,000 members of the Christian      Medical Association, we urge you to:       1. ensure the reallocation of funding currently used by      abortion-performing, partisan political organizations such as      Planned Parenthood, by directing that funding instead to the      over 13,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and      Rural Health Centers (RHCs); and,       2. overturn, through the Congressional Review Act, the US      Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule finalized      December 19, 2016, titled ``Compliance with Title X      Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting      Subrecipients,'' in order to ensure that states are allowed      to take a similar direction in allocating federal funding.       Many of our members serve in federally funded centers that      focus on providing care to patients regardless of who the      patient is or what the patient's values, orientation,      ethnicity or any other qualities may be. As you know well,      needy patients depend on these centers and on physicians like      our members to provide healthcare when likely no one else      would provide healthcare for them. FQHCs provide      comprehensive services and a ``medical home'' for whole      families and work in the areas of most critical need.       According to the independent government watchdog GAO in      2012, FQHCs served 21 million individuals and provided      services including STD testing, cancer screening and      contraceptive management, as well as other services including      immunizations and general child wellness exams. FQHCs and      RHCs often meet patient needs on modest budgets, and those      who serve in these centers often do so at great personal      financial sacrifice. Unlike Planned Parenthood, which follows      an aggressive business plan designed to maximize profits on      services such as abortion, these centers exist for the      purpose of serving the nation's most needy patients.       Yet some medical groups like the American Congress of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose pro-abortion ideology      aligns with Planned Parenthood and whose members profit      personally from working with Planned Parenthood, decry      ``political interference in the patient-physician      relationship.'' This cry comes, oddly enough, while applying      pressure on politicians to fund political groups like Planned      It is also worth observing what sources such as      the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and PolitiFact      National have confirmed--that Planned Parenthood spends      millions of dollars each year for one partisan purpose: to      elect Democrats and defeat       It's hard to get more political than that, and it's      impossible to get more politically partisan than that.       The majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars to      subsidize abortion, and they certainly do not want their tax      dollars to subsidize an abortion-performing partisan      political machine. Because of the strong concern of American      taxpayers, existing federal law addresses direct funding of      abortion. However, the fungible nature of federal grants to      Planned Parenthood means that every American's tax dollars,      regardless of their convictions about abortion, are being      used to prop up the abortion industry.       Any organization that wishes to avoid political      entanglement can do so quite easily--by simply foregoing      government funding. Those who seek funding should expect      federal and/or state oversight, requirements and standards.       Even the most modest of standards should disqualify from      federal funding organizations such as Planned Parenthood,      given the recent findings of the Select Investigative Panel      on Infant Lives, the list of 15 criminal and regulatory      referrals made by the Panel, and the referral by the Senate      Committee on the Judiciary to the FBI and the Department of      Justice for investigation and potential prosecution.       If any organization can and should do without federal      funding, the billion-dollar, corrupt abortion business      Planned Parenthood is a prime example.       We respectfully urge you to reallocate American tax dollars      away from such profit-centered, divisive and partisan      organizations and provide funding instead to patient-     centered, non-controversial and nonpartisan Federally      Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Centers      (RHCs). And we urge you to ensure that states can do the      same, applying reasonable state standards and requirements to      those who seek to use taxpayer funds. Thank you very much for      your consideration of these views, and for your leadership on      this issue.           Sincerely,                               David Stevens, MD, MA (Ethics) CEO.[[Page H1278]]                                       ____         United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Secretariat            of Pro-Life Activities,                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.       Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the U.     Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life      Activities to urge your support for H.Res 43. This      resolution of disapproval would nullify former President      Obama's final rule relating to compliance with Title X      requirements by project recipients. 81 91852 (     19, 2016). The stated purpose of this rule change is to      prevent states from excluding providers such as Planned      Parenthood from sub-awards based on state criteria, such as a      requirement that sub-recipients provide comprehensive primary      and preventive care in addition to family planning services.       The Title X rule change is bad public policy and should be      nullified for several reasons. First, it is deeply troubling      to many Americans that Planned Parenthood, the nation's      largest abortion network (performing over a third of all      abortions), receives more than half a billion taxpayer      dollars per year. This concern has rightly grown with      revelations about Planned Parenthood's willingness to traffic      in fetal tissue from abortions, and to alter abortion methods      not for any reason related to women's health but to obtain      more ``intact'' organs. Additionally, a recent revelation      that the vast majority of Planned Parenthood facilities do      not provide prenatal services provides additional evidence of      its bias toward providing and promoting abortion.       Second, the Department of Health and Human Service's stated      objective in preventing states from ensuring the seamless      delivery of comprehensive care places the Department in a      self-contradictory position. Last year in the Nation's      highest court, HHS touted the seamless coverage of health      services as a virtue. Indeed, the Department argued that      seamlessness is a government interest of the highest order,      sufficient to outweigh constitutionally and statutorily      protected religious objections.       In this new rule, however, HHS takes the opposite position,      saying that the seamless provision of services is an ill to      be avoided. The present rule would ensure that the provision      of care is fragmented, rather than seamless, because it would      undermine state requirements that sub-recipients provide      primary and preventive care in addition to family planning.      Seamlessness cannot at one and the same time be a government      interest of the highest order when it disadvantages religious      organizations, but an affirmative ill to be avoided when it      disadvantages Planned       Third, states may have other reasonable and persuasive      grounds for disqualifying entities from sub-awards that go      beyond the ability of such entities to ``provide Title X      services'' as the rule states (81 at 91860). For      example, a sub-award applicant may have been involved in      fraudulent practices, or the applicant or its stakeholders      may even have committed a crime, bearing on the applicant's      fitness and suitability for a sub-award. Indeed, the      requirements for federal awards and sub-awards in general are      typically accompanied by all sorts of standards, many of      which are imposed by the federal government itself, and those      standards often have little or nothing to do with the ability      to provide services (governmental guidelines are replete with      such requirements). States may also have widely differing      standards for sub-awardees based on the states' own policy      judgment. Therefore, it should be permissible for states to      decline to make a sub-award when the sub-awardee does not      meet applicable criteria, whether federal or state, even if      the entity is, strictly speaking, able to ``provide Title X      services.'' Those criteria, of course, themselves remain      subject to applicable federal and state law.       For each of these reasons, we urge you to support H.     43.

7882,topic-id,896,"Mr.President, this past Sunday we celebrated the 44th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, a ruling that assured every woman of her constitutional right to make her own decision about whether and when to have a child. That fundamental constitutional right is the right to privacy, which all women should cherish and protect.  This weekend, in fact, many of us in Washington, DC, and around the country marched in the streets of our home States--or here, as I did--in support of these ideals and values, including the right to privacy, other civil rights and liberties, economic opportunity, and women's access to health care, which truly make America great.  Fundamental to the principle of women's access to health care is the Roe v. Wade decision that reaffirms the constitutional right to reproductive decisions made by women individually on their own in consultation with their health care providers, their families, their clergy. I was a clerk for Justice Blackmun in the term after Roe v. Wade was decided, and I can tell you that we all believed then very strongly that that Supreme Court decision would put to rest the question of legal access to abortion in this great country.  In fact, it did not. Despite 7 in 10 Americans opposing the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade according to a recent survey by Pew Research Center, the outliers and extremists still seek to eliminate the right to legal abortion. That broad public support was embodied in the spirit and dedication shown over this past weekend by protesters across the world, and I was reminded yet again that we must continue to fight for what we believe, particularly in light of the ongoing threats to and attacks on women's health care.  Efforts to undermine these rights have redoubled in recent years, and throughout the past decade we have seen unprecedented attacks through State efforts to chip away at that vitally protected constitutional right. From 2011 to 2016, there were 334 restrictions enacted by States that would cut back on Roe v. Wade rights, accounting for 30 percent of all abortion restrictions since the U.Supreme Court decided that case.  The force dedicated to enacting these restrictions, which are designed to undermine the right to reproductive health care, can be particularly disheartening as they disregard the health needs of the most vulnerable population of the women who are most often impacted, by also seeking, or at least claiming to seek, to advance women's health care. In fact, many of those restrictions are a ruse. They are enacted in the name of health care but are a disguise for restrictions on health care. They have left many women, particularly in rural and underserved locations, with little access to health care, including basic care such as cancer screening, STD testing, and preventive health care. Clearly, improving women's health care has failed to be the focus of State legislatures in these instances, as they have actively worked to restrict access to care and chip away at the constitutional protections provided in Roe v.  I joined with Senator Murray in leading a total of 163 Members of the House and Senate in filing an amicus brief in the case of Whole Woman's Health v. Last summer, the Supreme Court overturned the restriction at issue in that case, reiterating and clarifying the ``undue burden'' standard in Roe and debunking the lie that anti-choice extremists have been pushing for years--that medically unnecessary, onerous restrictions on clinics and clinicians that provide women abortions do not make women safer. In fact, they simply constrain access.  I am hopeful that this decision will help stem and stop the assault on women's health care taking place in so many States and communities around the country. So I am joining with my colleague, Senator Murray, who was here just minutes ago--a wonderful champion of this cause--as well as Senator Shaheen, whom I believe will be speaking later today on Roe v. Wade's anniversary, in pushing back on this policy by introducing legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule that the Trump administration, as one of its first acts, has announced, which will reverse much of the progress that President Obama made in relation to international family planning. This legislation will seek to move that progress forward again and forestall the effort to roll back that process and turn back the clock. I will oppose any and all efforts by the Trump administration to move our country backwards, including yesterday's reversion to the global gag rule.  This 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade should be a reminder about the importance of fighting for the right of privacy, the right to live life free of governmental interference, and, as one of our Supreme Court Justices said, the right to be let alone--in effect, let alone from government interference.  It is a right that I have fought for and that so many others have fought for throughout my career and throughout my time as a Senator and the attorney general of It is a right we should all continue to keep at the forefront of our work here in the Senate and for all of us in this country.

President Trump repeatedly has tried to put himself above the law, and in just a few weeks has moved from scorning conflict-of-interest and disclosure principles to promulgating destructive, discriminatory Executive orders, and openly attacking the judiciary. His personal invectives and insults are unprecedented for the President of the United States against the judiciary. Without respect for the rule of law and the court system, democracy fails. No Cabinet member has more responsibility to ensure that the justice system is given this necessary respect and trust than the Attorney General of the United The sweeping authority in this position impacts the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans, implicating everything from our immigration system to law enforcement, to civil rights, national security, capital punishment, sentencing, and the U.Supreme  This job is one I know well. Like some of my colleagues, I served as U.attorney in the Department of Justice as the chief Federal prosecutor for Connecticut, for several years, reporting to the U.Attorney General, and, then, for several years afterward, as a private litigator, and, then, for 20 years as attorney general of the State of I fought alongside, and sometimes against, the U.Attorney General and the armies of lawyers at his disposal. In fact, the Attorney General commands thousands of lawyers who embody his power to speak on behalf of the United His job is to protect the public from criminal offenders and to convict the guilty, but also to protect the innocent who may be wrongly accused and to assure that justice is done.  In fact, as Justice Jackson said about the role of the U.Attorney General, which he filled, he is to seek justice, not just win cases. I know how powerful this position can be and how crucial the Attorney General is not as the appointee of a politician but as a servant of justice.  In discharging this sacred obligation, the Attorney General must always remain independent, not just in reality but in appearance. His decisions must supersede partisan politics. In most cases, there is, in fact, no recourse from his decision without political interference, which would be improper. He is not just another government lawyer. He is not just another Cabinet position. He is the Nation's lawyer. He is the people's lawyer. He must be the Nation's legal conscience.  This job requires a singular level of intellect and integrity, and a nonpartisan, but passionate devotion to the rule of law.  Over the past week, as our Nation's courts did their job and sorted through the implications of the President's hasty, ill-conceived, and illegal Executive orders, President Trump called into question the very integrity of our judicial system. Not only did he label U.District Court Judge Robart a ``so-called judge,'' but he also suggested that the American people should blame him and our ``court system'' if something should happen as a result of the court's blocking his Executive order.  In this anticipatory blame, the bluster and bullying are inappropriate and un-Presidential, and I believe they threaten harm to our democracy as well as the judicial system.  The comments were deeply disturbing to all of us who believe in the integrity of the judicial system--including the American Bar Association, which said through Linda Klein, its president, that ``personal attacks on judges are attacks on our Constitution,'' and ``the independence of the judiciary is not up for negotiation . . . independence from party politics, independence from Congress, and independence from the president of the United States himself.''

So the President will direct the Vice President, and presumably his next Attorney General, to investigate these bogus claims of voter fraud. Instead, the new Attorney General should examine voter suppression and disenfranchisement in the elections. I fear this new study on widespread ``voter fraud'' is simply a pretext to impose more onerous restrictions on the right to vote--to try to keep a certain segment of Americans--making it more difficult for them to vote because they may be more likely to vote for someone other than Mr.That is not what the Attorney General should be doing.  Based on his record, Senator Sessions would work with the Trump administration to further restrict the right to vote and roll back the clock on this cherished civil right, which is protected by our  On the issue of immigration, Senator Sessions has a long record where he has fought against bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform in the He led the efforts in 2007 and in 2013 to defeat bipartisan legislation in the He used the untruthful ``amnesty'' tag to describe the tough-but-fair pathway to citizenship in this legislation, which passed by a 68-to-32 vote in 2013. He has opposed relief for the DREAMers and has opposed the Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals--DACA--program. He supported anti-immigration State laws in Arizona and elsewhere that the Supreme Court has struck down as unconstitutional.  During the Presidential campaign, Mr.Trump issued a press release ``calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'' Several days later, Senator Leahy offered a resolution in the Judiciary Committee that stated, ``It is the sense of the Senate that the United States must not bar individuals from entering the United States based on their religion, as such action would be contrary to the fundamental principles of which this nation was founded.'' The vote was 16 to 4 in favor of the Leahy resolution. Senator Sessions voted no and spoke against the resolution for nearly half an hour and concluded by stating that the Leahy resolution ``goes beyond being unwise. It is reckless. It is absolute and without qualification. It could have pernicious impacts for decades, even centuries to come. It may be even a step from the concept of the nation-state to the idea of `global citizenship.' ''  Barring a religious test of people coming into our Nation would create that type of a Nation? That is who we are as a Those are our core values. We embrace diversity.  Senator Sessions' views are far outside the mainstream and would unsettle many years of law and precedent that protect individual religious beliefs. I am gravely concerned about how an Attorney General Sessions would advise President Trump on the lawfulness of a Muslim ban. He recently issued his Executive order, which a district court has put on hold and is now being challenged in the Ninth I cosponsored legislation to rescind President Trump's discriminatory Executive order barring immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and suspending the U.refugee program.  I am also concerned as to how Attorney General Sessions would advise the President on matters of immigration. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired and her conduct was called shameful by President Trump, simply because she was upholding the Constitution, giving her advice. The President has criticized the ``so-called judge'' who temporarily stayed his travel ban with an ``outrageous'' decision, and said that the judge would be blamed if a terrorist attack occurred in the United The Attorney General has to be able to stand up to even the President with these reckless words and actions. We need an independent Attorney General who will uphold the Constitution and recognize that he is not the President's attorney, he is the people's attorney. I am not convinced that Attorney General Sessions would be that type of person.  Senator Sessions led the opposition to the nomination of my fellow Marylander Tom Perez to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice when President Obama nominated him in 2009. At the time, Senator Sessions said:       I am also concerned Mr.Perez will not be committed to      fully enforcing our Nation's immigration laws, some I have      worked hard on. We need to create a lawful system of      immigration. . . . He previously served as the President of      the Board of CASA of Maryland, an immigrant advocacy      organization that has taken some extreme views and been      criticized by a number of people in the media. CASA of      Maryland issued a pamphlet instructing immigrants confronted      by the police to remain silent. CASA also promotes day labor      sites. This is where people, often without lawful status,      come and seek work . . . and [they] oppose restrictions on      illegal immigrants receiving drivers' licenses. He was      President of the  That was Senator Sessions' quote. Senator Sessions also commented on Mr.Perez directly:       I am concerned where Mr.Perez will be in this [running the      Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]. He has been      pretty active politically. When he ran for the Montgomery,      MD, county council he responded to a question asking, `What      would you like the voters to know about you?' Mr.Perez said:      `I am a progressive Democrat and always was and always will      be.' This is a free country and that is all right. I am just      saying, in all fairness, that statement makes me a little      nervous.  Again, quoting from Senator The Senate did right by my friend and colleague Tom He was confirmed by the Senate to the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice by a 72-to-22 vote. Now, I understand people may have a reason to vote one way or the other, but the reasons stated by Senator Sessions in regard to Mr.Perez caused me great, great concern. Senator Sessions again opposed Mr.Perez when he was later nominated to be Secretary of In both of these cases, Senator Sessions' views were far outside the mainstream on Mr. As the senior Senator from Maryland, I know CASA of I have been there. I have seen the people they service. They do extraordinary work to help the immigrant community. They are not a fringe advocacy group. While Mr.Perez is a progressive, he is a dedicated public servant, having been elected by the people of Maryland to the Montgomery County Council and appointed by President Obama to run the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department and later the Labor Mr.Perez worked to expand the right to vote, protect the rights of all Americans, and ensure American workers had a decent wage and employers treated their employees with fairness and respect.  I fear Attorney General Sessions would turn back the clock on so many civil and worker rights that we hold dear as  Senator Sessions opposed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention Senator Sessions supported a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages, opposed the repeal of don't ask, don't tell in the military, and harshly criticized the Supreme Court's recent decision legalizing same-sex marriages across the country. He harshly criticized the Court for redefining a ``sacred and ancient institution,'' and called the ruling ``part of a continuing effort to secularize, by force and intimidation'' the Once again, I fear an Attorney General Sessions would turn back the clock on LGBT rights to a[[Page S850]]time when individuals would no longer have the legal right to marry the person they love.  Senator Sessions voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act, title X funding for contraception, breast screening, and health services for low-income women, and reauthorization of the Violence Against Women He voted to defund Planned I am concerned whether Senator Sessions would enforce equal rights and protection for women as our next Attorney  Senator Sessions has consistently fought against criminal justice reform in the Senate and led the effort to defeat the recent bipartisan proposals that would modestly reduce sentencing disparities and ease ex-offenders' reentry into society.  Senator Sessions opposed my Ramos and Liu blue alert act due to fiscal concerns, even though the legislation cost was scored at nominal or less than $1 million for implementation by Law enforcement agencies strongly supported my legislation, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2015. Blue Alert helps our law enforcement officers, those who are threatened or endangered or where there has been an incident. It gives law enforcement the opportunity to apprehend the suspect in a timely way. It scored nominal or less than $1 million, and was used by Senator Sessions to block this important tool to help our law enforcement officers.  Senator Sessions has generally condemned the Department of Justice's use of its power to investigate law enforcement agencies accused of misconduct and a ``pattern and practice'' of violating civil rights, calling consent decrees that mandate reform following these investigations ``an end run around the democratic process.'' That causes me concern because that is an important part of what we are doing in my hometown of  We had a major problem in the Freddie Gray episode. We requested a pattern and practice investigation. We are now working with the consent decree. The people of Baltimore and the people of Maryland are anxious to get this matter moving forward and are anxious to see this consent order bring a successful conclusion to that recommendation and investigation.  Senator Sessions led the opposition to Senator Mikulski and my recommendation of Paula Xinis to be a U.district judge for the District of Maryland in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor. The Alliance for Justice provided an account of Paula Xinis' confirmation hearing, which I will quote from at length here.  ``Turning to the nominee of the District Court of Maryland, Paula Xinis, Senator Sessions unleashed a line of accusatory questions suggesting that Xinis' career as a public defender and civil rights lawyer showed an `agenda' that she would invariably `bring to the bench.'

7755,topic-id,784,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I also oppose this underlying bill, which is why I call it, as others have, the wrongdoer protection act for multistate and multinational corporations, and for that purpose, I add this amendment.  It is no coincidence that these corporate wrongdoers want to force consumers to fight them in Federal court. That is the effect of this bill, to enlarge Federal court diversity jurisdiction.  It is no coincidence that the corporate wrongdoers want to fight in Federal court. It is not because they think the Federal judges are better looking or the Federal judges are more polite or the decor in the Federal courtrooms is nicer to look at. That is not it all. They want to go there because they are more likely to prevail and to beat consumers in Federal court. They know that.  They know that, after a generation of regrettable decisions across the street by the Supreme Court of the United States, Federal court has become very favorable turf for corporate wrongdoers--generations of bad decisions that invite and exhort Federal judges to forget about the Seventh Amendment in our Bill of  You remember the Seventh It was written by James It was announced as approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, whose statue stands right outside this It was an amendment that says very simply: `` . . . in suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . . `'  There is nothing ambiguous about that statement. It is not hard to understand. It is about how important the right to trial by jury is to us here in these United  But since the 1980s, there has been this steady drumbeat of decisions from the United States Supreme Court encouraging and emboldening Federal court judges to decide and dismiss cases without the trouble of a jury trial. Their toolkit is enormous for doing that: motions to dismiss, motions for judgment on the pleadings, motions for summary judgment, motions for directed verdict, motions for judgment as a matter of law.[[Page H1974]]  Cases do get thrown out every day in this country without the trouble of a jury trial, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial is not preserved. That is why wrongdoer corporations prefer to be in the Federal court.  Federal court has become candy land for corporate wrongdoers in this country, and this bill helps them stay there and fight consumers in Federal court. It changes the law to allow corporate wrongdoers to do that.  I want to give you some very strong reasons, Mr.Chairman, why this bill is so bad.  Number one, it is discriminatory. Unless you are a multistate or multinational corporation, this bill doesn't help you. If you are an individual sued in State court, this bill does not help you. If you are a small-business owner only doing work in your State, this bill does not help you. Only multistate, multinational corporations get help from this bill, and that is why I call it the wrongdoers protection act for multistate and multinational corporations.  Number two, it is burdensome. The Federal courts are already overworked and understaffed. The civil caseload is growing at 12 percent a year. There are currently 123 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. There is no reason to add to this burden by changing the law.  Number three, this bill forces State court cases into Federal court. We have a crowd in this House that consistently preaches about states' rights and the need to cut back on the Federal Government's reach, but a bill like this comes along and they drop that state's rights banner like it is a hot potato and pick up the coat of arms of the multistate, multinational corporations.  If you really do care about states' rights, you should be voting ``no'' on this bill.  You see, these cases called diversity cases are filed in State court under State law. Ever since the 1930s, in the Erie Railroad case, if you take these cases and handle them in Federal court, the Federal judges are bound by law to follow State law, not Federal law.  Mr.Chairman, there is nobody better at interpreting and following State law than State court judges. It stands to reason.  I offer this amendment that is at the desk to exempt consumer cases against insurance companies for bad faith in insurance practices. If the majority is going to persist and present this gift to multistate and multinational corporations, at least include this amendment and protect consumers trying to fight insurance companies.

Well, there is a Federal investigation of the present President of the United States--something that has never happened before--and that has put a dark cloud that can only be lifted by showing in the light of day what the President's involvements were with his income taxes, whom he owes money to.

I respect him very much and turn to him often to find bipartisan support when, frankly, no one else will answer the phone. He has been a great friend and ally and has been very blunt with me when we disagree. We do disagree today, and I do it respectfully because Senator Graham is a person I do, in fact, respect as a Senate colleague.  He is right about one thing: You would expect a new President to pick someone to be an Attorney General whom they know and trust. It might have even been someone from the campaign trail.  A classic example is 1960, when President John Kennedy was elected and chose his brother Robert Kennedy, who had worked on his campaign, to serve as Attorney General of the United You can't think of a clearer analogy to what has been described today. But the point that was made earlier by Senator Feinstein about the relationship of Senator Sessions with Candidate Trump is one that goes beyond familiarity, beyond support in a political campaign. In fact, they did work together, and they do agree on some fundamental issues.  If the press can be trusted--and the White House is the first to tell us they can't--but if the press can be trusted,[[Page S833]]in a Washington Post article of January 31, 2017, we see a very clear working relationship that extends beyond the would-be Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the new President Donald Trump but includes a former key staffer for Senator Sessions, Steve Miller, and a man named Steve Bannon, who is with Breitbart News and is now a political inspiration to the Trump White It appears that they have a very close working relationship among them. That in and of itself is not troubling, except when you look at the issues they have worked on closely together--the issue of immigration, the Executive orders, of which the Post said Senator Sessions was the ``intellectual godfather.'' That is a clear example pointed out by this article, and that is one of the reasons it was raised by Senator  I understand what Senator Graham has to say: that Senator Sessions has been nothing more than a Senator loyal to his home State of Alabama in his politics and in his views on issues. I do acknowledge that and can tell you that, over 20 years, I have heard Senator Sessions's speeches repeatedly, and he does take those positions. But the thing that troubles me is the question about whether the values of the Senator from Alabama are the values we want in the Attorney General of the United To be very blunt, in some cases, they are not, as far as I am concerned.  I understand that President Trump won the election, but that doesn't mean, when it comes to advice and consent, that every Member of the Senate has to bow and step back a few steps for every nominee proposed by this new We have a responsibility to ask what is right for America, what is right in terms of values and judgments that we bring to this job, as well.  It is not a happy moment for me to say this, but I do stand in opposition to the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney General of the United The reason I don't view this as a happy moment is I have known him for 20 years. We have worked in the Senate, in committees, and on the floor. I know him personally. I met his family. And to say that I don't support him for this elevation to Attorney General is something that is hard to say, but I know that I have to. This is not a decision I have come to lightly. Senator Sessions is a colleague of over 20 years. But the question we now face is whether he is the right person to be the 1 law enforcement official in the United States of  He comes to this new opportunity in a sharply divided nation. We have a controversial new President who already has seen an Executive order blocked by the courts in what appears to be record time. Think about that for a moment. Donald Trump has been President of the United States for 19 days. In those 19 days, he has issued an Executive order stopped by the Federal courts of the land from implementation and he has dismissed an Attorney No other new President, in 19 days, can point to that happening. It is an indication of the types of policies he is promoting. It is also an indication that in the future, he is likely to again test the separation of powers in this government.  In this context, the need for an independent Attorney General has never been greater. We need an Attorney General who will not just serve as the President's lawyer or cheerleader but who will defend the constitutional rights of everyone, including protecting those rights from an overreaching President, if necessary. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have carefully considered this nomination, and I am not persuaded that Senator Sessions will serve that level of independence.  Also, I have strong concerns that. if he is confirmed, he won't adequately pursue the cause of justice on a range of important issues. In his nomination hearing, Senator Sessions said on issue after issue that he would simply follow the law, enforce the law, but that doesn't come close to capturing the real role of the Attorney The Attorney General, as chief prosecutor in America, doesn't just ``follow the law''; that person uses his discretion to determine how the law is enforced and whom it is enforced against. Ignoring that is to ignore one of the key elements of service as Attorney  As Acting Attorney General Sally Yates reminded us, the Attorney General has a critical role at times in even standing up to the The American Bar Association standards say that the duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict. I don't have confidence, based on the answers he has given me, that Senator Sessions would follow that standard.  Here is one example. At the hearing, I introduced Senator Sessions to Alton Mills of Chicago, who in his youth was a street-level courier for drug dealers. He was sentenced to life without parole and prison at age 24--life without parole at age 24 under the Federal three strikes and you are out law. He was sentenced on a nonviolent drug offense--no guns, no violence. He sold drugs a third time and got a life sentence.  Even the judge imposing the sentence did not agree with it, but he said the law said what he had to follow and his hands were tied. Alton Mills needed to pay for his mistakes, but he did not need to spend the rest of his life in prison. In December 2015, President Obama commuted Alton's sentence, after he had served 22 years in prison.  Under the Obama administration, Justice Department prosecutors were directed to search out low-level offenders like Alton Mills and use the discretion of the Department of Justice and make sure that they were given a second chance. Senator Sessions has said that he strongly opposes these guidelines.  When it came to clemency, Senator Sessions fiercely criticized President Obama, saying he commuted sentences in ``an unprecedented reckless manner.'' Senator Sessions also said: ``So-called low-level non-violent offenders simply do not exist in the Federal system.''  When it came to changing the law that led to Alton Mills sentence, Senator Sessions led the opposition. I appreciate the work we did together on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. But every time I have returned to Senator Sessions and asked him to work with me for the thousands still stuck in Federal prison for nonviolent drug offenses under the old sentencing disparities which we have now rejected, he refused, time and again. He has opposed every bipartisan effort, including a bill that I put together with Senator Grassley, Senator Cornyn, and others to allow individuals to petition on an individual basis for sentence reductions.  So to sum it up, Senator Sessions has staunchly opposed using prosecutorial discretion, clemency, or legislation to address the plight of thousands of people like Alton What can we expect of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the next 4 years when it comes to criminal justice and criminal sentencing reform? I am afraid we can't expect a caring person to take a look at the simple injustice in our system.  I have listened. time and again, as many other colleagues have, to the statements made by Senator Sessions on the issue of immigration. I have said before on this floor--and I will say it again--that I am the proud son of an immigrant. For generations. America has been renewed and enriched through immigration. Since World War II, we have set an example to the world when it comes to providing a safe haven for refugees.  We have four Hispanic Senators in this Three of them are Cuban What can we say about the Cuban refugees who came to the United States by the hundreds of thousands to flee the oppression of Castro? They were not subjected to extreme vetting. In most cases, we said: If you can find freedom in this country you are welcome. They have made America a better nation for it.  Since World War II, that has been America's standard. Now it is being challenged. It is hard to understand how the Trump administration could consider spending so much on a Mexican wall that Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800 miles of the southwest border, described as ``the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.''  I have come to this floor and voted for more money for walls and obstacles and technology on that border than I ever imagined necessary, in the hopes that we could finally put to rest this notion that we could always do more. I wonder what image it creates of this[[Page S834]]country, as we continue to talk about walls and banning travel.  President Trump signed an Executive order on January 27 banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, and banning refugees from those countries into the United As I go through the list of the people who were affected by this, overwhelmingly they are women and children, victims of war, terrorism, and persecution. Many of them have been waiting literally for years to come to the United Since World War II, we have accepted so many refugees from Eastern Europe, from Vietnam, from Cuba, as I mentioned earlier, and from Over 100,000 Soviet Jews make their home in the United States because we accepted them as refugees.  Now President Trump has issued this Executive order that is being challenged in court, and we will know within a matter of days whether it will be stayed or continued, contested or if it will stand as law. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said that she could not stand to defend that order. She felt it was illegal and unconstitutional.  The question, obviously, is what would the new Attorney General, if it is Jeff Sessions do, when faced with that same challenge? My fear is that he would not stand in independent judgment of the actions of the That to me is unfortunate and falls short of what we expect from the Attorney  We need someone like Edward Levi, the longtime president of the University of Chicago, who served as a truly nonpartisan Attorney General under President He restored honor and integrity to the Justice Department after Where would Senator Sessions stand once confirmed? Would he defend the President's Executive orders? Would he stand up to the President if he disagreed with him? I have strong concerns.  Mr.President, one of the most important issues when it comes to the Attorney General is the oversight of the Civil Rights Division, which is, in fact, the crown jewel of the Justice Department, as far as I am concerned. It is responsible for protecting the civil rights of all  Senator Cory Booker and Congressmen John Lewis and Cedric Richmond gave powerful testimony at Senator Sessions' hearing. They discussed their concerns about the Justice Department under his leadership and whether it would protect the civil and voting rights of all I took their words to heart. I want to talk specifically about their concerns about the Voting Rights  One month from now, we will recognize the 52nd anniversary of what came to be known as Bloody Sunday--March 7, 1965. John Lewis and Hosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists in a march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, The marchers were brutally beaten as State troopers turned them back and chased them down. John Lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed.  A few months after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, guaranteeing that the right to vote would not be restricted through clever schemes like poll taxes and literacy tests devised to keep African Americans from voting.  In 2006, Congress voted to reauthorize that same act after holding 21 hearings, hearing testimony from more than 90 witnesses, and receiving 15,000 pages of evidence.  Congressman Lewis said in an op-ed about the ongoing need for that act:       Congress came to a near-unanimous conclusion: While some      change has occurred, the places with a legacy of long-     standing, entrenched and state-sponsored voting      discrimination still have the most persistent, flagrant,      contemporary records of discrimination in this country. While      the 16 jurisdictions affected by Section 5 represent only 25      percent of the nation's population, they still represent more      than 80 percent of the lawsuits proving cases of voting      discrimination.  While Senator Sessions ultimately voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, his comments about the law have been very troubling.  In contrast to Congressman Lewis's statement about the need for a strong Voting Rights Act, Senator Sessions repeatedly criticized the law's section 5 preclearance provision, which required certain jurisdictions--including, but not limited to, Alabama--to ``preclear'' any changes to their voting laws with the Department of At his nomination hearing last month, Senator Sessions reiterated his view that section 5 of the law, in his words, was ``intrusive.''  He also celebrated the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder when a divided Court--5 to 4--gutted the Voting Rights Act and struck down the preclearance provision. That decision left the Department of Justice with fewer tools to protect Americans' right to vote. Nonetheless, on the day of that awful decision, Senator Sessions stated: ``[The decision was] good news, I think, for the South, in that [there was] not sufficient evidence to justify treating them disproportionately.'' Senator Sessions was wrong to dismiss the vital role that preclearance has played in protecting voters from discriminatory laws.  When Senator Sessions came to my office for a personal meeting before this hearing began, I sat down with him and talked about the Voting Rights I gave to him a book written by Carol She is a political science professor at Emory University in the State of The book is entitled ``White Rage.'' Carol Anderson systematically goes through the history of race in America after the Civil War, and she points out in each section how Congress would, on one hand, give rights to African Americans and then turn around and take them away. The most recent example relates to the Voting Rights Act itself and all the efforts of the 1960s to guarantee that minorities had the right to vote in She follows it with the undeniable record of efforts toward voter suppression when it comes to minorities in the United  I pointed this out to Senator Sessions because he has been in denial over this reality. I told him about hearings that we held in Ohio, in Florida, taking election officials, putting them under oath--officials from both political parties--and asking them point blank: Before you established the need for these voting restrictions in your State, what was the incidence of widespread voter fraud that led you to believe it was necessary? And the answer repeatedly was, there was none. No incidents of widespread voter fraud to speak of. No incidents of anything substantial when it came to prosecution. Clearly the motive behind these voter suppression laws are just that--to suppress voters from their opportunity to vote.  What can we expect of Attorney General Sessions on this issue? I am afraid, based on his statements, his record, his voting, we can expect the worst.  Example: A three-judge Federal appeals court struck down a North Carolina law that required voter ID and limited early voting. The court found that the law was crafted and passed with ``racially discriminatory intent,'' in violation of the Constitution and section 2 of the Voting Rights In the decision, this Federal court noted this regarding the North Carolina statute:       Before enacting [the] law, the legislature requested data      on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon      receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted      legislation that restricted voting and registration in five      different ways, all of which disproportionately affected      African  We are still facing this challenge in I wish it were not the case. I had hoped at this point in my life that I would be pointing to our problems with race as something from the past, but it is a current challenge we face, and it is a challenge the Attorney General must face squarely. I do not believe that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will do that, and that is why I can't support him for that position.  Of course there is also Senator Sessions' decision as U.attorney to bring the 1985 Perry County case when he was in He prosecuted three African-American civil rights activists for voter fraud. All three were acquitted. That case prompted former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, who was an attorney for the defendants, to send a letter to members of our committee saying, ``To use prosecutorial discretion to attempt to criminalize voter assistance is wrong and should be disqualifying for any aspirant to the Nation's highest law enforcement post.''  Senator Sessions' statements and his records are particularly concerning in[[Page S835]]light of President Trump's recent repeated, baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2016 Presidential election. Make no mistake--President Trump's false claim that there were millions of fraudulent votes cast in the last election is an excuse for further voter suppression efforts.  It is imperative that the Department of Justice be led by someone who values the vital role the Department plays in protecting the right to vote. Given Senator Sessions' dismissive comments about the Voting Rights Act and his history of supporting burdensome voting laws, I am not confident he is prepared to do that.  Senator Sessions' record on religious freedom also raises significant questions. The free exercise of religion is enshrined in the First Amendment of the However, Senator Sessions has only been outspoken in his defense of religious freedom for some faiths. For example, he denounced a 1997 court order that limited prayer in Alabama public schools, calling it ``one more example of the effort by the courts to eliminate the natural expression of religious belief from public life.''  A year later, he introduced a Senate resolution ``affirming the right to display the Ten Commandments in public places, including government offices and courthouses.'' He said ``[w]e've got to end the hostility toward the display of the Ten Commandments in public places.''  But he has been much more ambivalent about He has referred to Islam as ``a toxic ideology'' and said of American Muslims ``our nation has an unprecedented assimilation problem.'' When President Trump first proposed his ban on Muslim immigrants during the 2016 campaign, Senator Sessions said, ``I think it's appropriate to begin to discuss this, and he has forced that discussion.''  I am also concerned about Senator Sessions' support of laws and cases that permit individuals and companies to discriminate against other Americans on the basis of religious beliefs. For example, in 2015, the Supreme Court held that marriage equality is the law of the land in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Sessions referred to the decision as an:     effort to secularize, by force and intimidation, a society      that would not exist but for the faith which inspired people      to sail across unknown waters and trek across unknown      frontiers.  After disparaging the decision, Senator Sessions went on to cosponsor the First Amendment Defense Act, which would permit widespread discrimination against LGBTQ individuals on the basis of religious beliefs.  Senator Sessions also praised the Supreme Court's troubling 5-4 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act permits closely held, for-profit corporations to deny contraceptive coverage to employees due to religious objections.  If confirmed to be the next Attorney General, Senator Sessions will be responsible for protecting the rights of all Americans, regardless of their faith or beliefs. That is why I am deeply concerned about Senator Sessions' record, which suggests that he may prioritize the freedom of certain faiths over others, and permit religious freedom to be used as a guise for discrimination.  The Attorney General also has great power to determine how the Department of Justice's resources will be prioritized. I am alarmed that Senator Sessions will not commit to support funding for important programs like COPS and Byrne-And I am deeply disappointed that he will not commit to increase Justice Department resources for Chicago to address the city's surge in gun violence.  I asked Senator Sessions about this when we met in person before his hearing and again as part of my written hearing questions. It is well known that there's been an epidemic of gun violence facing the City of There were more than 760 homicides in Chicago last year, a 58 percent increase over the previous year. More than 4,300 people were shot last year in the city. It is a crisis.  At our meeting, I handed Senator Sessions a copy of Mayor Emanuel's plan to improve public safety. The plan calls for hiring nearly a thousand more Chicago police; more training and equipment, like body-worn cameras and gunshot detection technology; more mentoring programs for youth; and reforms to rebuild trust and cooperation between police and the community.  All of these are areas where the Justice Department can, and must, help. The Justice Department's COPS program helps local police departments put more cops on the beat. The Byrne-JAG program helps them buy equipment. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention provides mentoring and violence prevention funds. And the Civil Rights Division was invited in by me, the mayor, and the state Attorney General to review the Chicago Police Department's practices. On January 13, they reached an agreement in principle with the City to pursue much-needed reforms and to seek to enforce the reforms through a consent decree.  I asked Senator Sessions about his support for these efforts, especially in light of President Trump's tweets where he has urged Mayor Emanuel to ask for Federal help--even though the Mayor has already asked for aid--and threatened to ``send in the Feds'' to But Senator Sessions has steadfastly refused to make any commitment of Justice Department resources to help reduce Chicago's violence. He refused to commit to increase Justice Department funding for He wouldn't even commit not to cut funding. He refused to commit to honor the agreement in Principle that the Justice Department signed with the city to reform the Chicago Police  And he refused to commit not to request budget cuts to the COPS and Byrne-JAG programs and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  This is unfathomable to me. Now is not the time for the Justice Department to turn its back on the City of Chicago and its people. It is hard to understand how the Trump administration could think about spending $15 billion on an inexpensive and ineffective wall and not commit to spend another penny to address gun violence in If the administration took just 1 percent of what they want for a border wall and used it to help Chicago implement the mayor's public safety plan with more police, training, and youth job programs, we could save a lot of lives. But instead Senator Sessions and the Trump administration are threatening to cut Federal funds for Their priorities are profoundly misplaced.  Senator Sessions did say he would increase Federal gun prosecutions. That may be helpful, but it is not enough to reduce gun violence. The Chicago Sun-Times looked at Federal gun prosecutions over the past 5 years and found that cities like Detroit and Baltimore had significantly more than Chicago, but their per-capita homicide rates are still higher that Chicago's. So that is not enough.  Senator Sessions also seems to think that immigrants are at the root of most of our Nation's crime problems. That is why he pushes to withhold critical Federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. But many studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes than native-born individuals. And there is no evidence whatsoever that undocumented immigrants are responsible for any significant proportion of the murders in If sanctuary cities are the problem, why did a sanctuary city like New York City experience record low crime in 2016? Senator Sessions' priorities when it comes to these issues does not give me confidence.  I am also troubled by the casual approach that Senator Sessions has adopted when it comes to Russian interference in our Presidential election.  Election Day 2016 is a day that will live in cyber infamy. A foreign adversary intentionally manipulated America's Presidential election. Amid warnings of Russian manipulation going back to early October, President Donald Trump not only resisted these findings, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and dismissed the true nature of Putin and his threat. As early as July of last year, then-candidate Trump urged a foreign adversary of the United States to conduct espionage against Hillary He said, ``I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing . . . I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.'' And[[Page S836]]President Trump, who has impulsively attacked just about anyone who criticizes him, has not criticized the one person who is guilty of sponsoring this cyber attack: Vladimir  This is bigger than one election or one person. This is about our national security, and we should take it seriously.  For those who have been following Putin's actions over the last several years, this attack should come as no surprise. Russia has conducted cyber warfare against Ukraine, the Netherlands, Georgia, Lithuania, Estonia, and a host of other nations. Russia now appears focused on disrupting the upcoming German elections over Putin's dislike of Chancellor And it could happen again here.  We need to know that the next U.Attorney General will take this matter seriously as well and will be independent of the White This means allowing career Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI to follow the facts and the law.  I am concerned about Senator Sessions when it comes to this assignment. I asked Senator Sessions questions about this. In his written responses, he admitted that he has not even read the January 6 intelligence community assessment on Russian involvement in the U.election--neither the classified nor the unclassified version. As recently as last week, Senator Sessions admitted he still has not read this report.  The unclassified version incidentally is just a few pages if you don't count the annexes. I read it in less than 15 minutes.  Senator Sessions, seeking to be the top law enforcement official in the land, should have found time to read this report. His failure to do so is inexplicable. This does not give me confidence that Senator Sessions is giving this matter the attention it deserves.  I also asked Senator Sessions if he would commit not to impede or terminate ongoing Justice Department or FBI investigations into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. He would not make any commitment about allowing investigations to continue if confirmed.  And I asked Senator Sessions if he would recuse himself from any FBI or DOJ investigation into Russian efforts to influence the election. He said he was not aware of a basis to recuse himself.  Well, Department of Justice regulations call for recusals from investigations due to personal or political relationships. And it is clear that Senator Sessions has a close relationship with President Trump, including on Russia issues. Senator Sessions was a prominent supporter of the President's campaign.  On March 3, 2016, then-candidate Trump announced that Sessions would serve as chairman of Mr.Trump's National Security Advisory Committee and that he would ``provide strategic counsel to Mr.Trump on foreign policy and homeland security.''  In a July 31, 2016 interview with CNN, Senator Sessions stated the following:       What I want to tell you is that Hillary Clinton left her      email system totally vulnerable to a Russian penetration.      It's probably clear that they have what was on that system. I      have people come up to me all the time and say, why don't      you--if you want to find out where those 30,000 emails are,      why don't you ask the Russians? They're the ones that have      them . . . The big issue is, can we, should we be able to      create a new and positive relationship with I think      it's . . . it makes no sense that we're at the hostility      level we are.  On August 15, 2016, USA Today published an article entitled ``Jeff Sessions backs Donald Trump on Russia Policy'' detailing how Sessions changed his hawkish position on Russia to align with then-candidate Trump's statements. It said:       ""Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., has long supported increased      military spending and tough talk about the threat Russia      poses to the U.and its allies in Since becoming an      adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump,      however, those principles appear to have undergone some      revisions. Trump has upended traditional conservative caution      toward Russia by exchanging niceties with President Vladimir      Putin and expressing hope for warmer relations. And Sessions,      a frequent surrogate for the Trump campaign in public      appearances, is nodding in agreement.''  On October 7, 2016, Politico published a story entitled ``Lobbyist advised Trump campaign while promoting Russian pipeline: Richard Burt helped shape the candidate's first foreign-policy speech while lobbying on behalf of a Moscow-controlled gas company.'' The Politico story noted that the lobbyist in question ``attended two dinners this summer hosted by Alabama Jeff Sessions, who had been named chairman of Trump's national security committee'' and that the lobbyist ``was invited to discuss issues of national security and foreign policy, and wrote white papers for Sessions on the same subjects . . . `'  In an October 30 interview with DefenseNews, Senator Sessions said, ``The United States and Russia should be able to be far more harmonious than we are today.''  Clearly, an investigation into the reported Russia-Trump allegations has the potential to significantly impact the interests of Senator Sessions' soon-to-be-boss, if he's confirmed, and his close political ally.  Again, Senator Sessions' answers to my questions do not give me confidence. In the end, the American people deserve the truth about Russian involvement in our election. The stakes too high to ignore.  There are other aspects of Senator Sessions' record that give me serious concerns about what his priorities would be if confirmed as Attorney General, including his vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act; his votes against the Detainee Treatment Act and the McCain-Feinstein Army Field Manual Amendment; his past statement that the use of prison chain gangs was ``perfectly proper''; his opposition to laws such as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention Act; his questioning of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship; and his refusal to commit to recuse himself from involvement in any case, investigation or Office of Legal Counsel decision involving the receipt of emoluments by President All of these factors have weighed on me as I have considered this nomination  Mr.President, let me conclude.  We need a nonpartisan Attorney General with the independence, judgment, and backbone to stand up to a President when his actions are illegal or unjust. Senator Sessions is an able politician. He has been an able representative of his State of But he is not the right person to serve as Donald Trump's Attorney  The Justice Department's motto ``qui pro domina justitia sequitur'' refers to an Attorney General ``who prosecutes on behalf of justice.'' Based on his record and his responses to questions over the past few weeks, I am not confident Senator Sessions would be such an Attorney I cannot support his nomination, and I will vote against him.

Mr.Speaker, we know the way this incredible tool has shaped the world in the last generation. The Internet can instantaneously connect people across the world from each other who a few years ago would never cross paths in a lifetime.

It allows entrepreneurs in emerging markets to sell their products in global markets.  To be sure, the power of the Internet can cut both way. ISIS has proved all too adept at using social media to recruit fighters and spread its hateful message. But put to its highest purpose, the Internet can help drive economic growth and spread stability and prosperity.  Unfortunately, too few people around the world have access to this tool. Roughly 60 percent of the world's population is not online, and the growth rate of Internet access is slowing. If you live in a poor community or a rural area, sometimes just because you are a woman, it is harder to take advantage of the  We know where that lack of access is holding populations back.

7853,topic-id,303,"Madam Speaker, this is not a women's issue or a men's issue. It is an issue for what is right. People have a right to make health choices. If someone doesn't believe in abortion, then make that choice for yourself. If someone believes in something else, then they have the right to make that choice. So eligibility for title X funding should be based on a provider's ability to provide family planning services, period. Whether a provider offers safe and legal abortions with private funds should not be used to prevent women and men from getting preventive care like cancer screenings or HIV tests. That is all the rule requires.  It should not be controversial. Yet, here we are.  What effect would this Congressional Review Act have?  Well, Kansas has given us an ominous preview. When Kansas defunded providers that offered abortion services, the number of Kansans accessing cancer screenings, STI tests, and other care through the title X program plummeted by thousands. A vote for this CRA is a vote to multiply that number.  The Americans who will be affected by this CRA will lose the opportunity to see the provider of their choice, sometimes the only viable provider.  Why would we want to put women--why would we want to put anybody in that category, where they cannot see the only viable provider because someone else doesn't like what the doctor can do?  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' My Republican friends always talk about individual freedom and how important it is. This is an individual freedom of a woman's right to control her own body and to make personal choices on health care. We should not interfere with that. We should allow the most and the best health care to be available to all people. I urge a ``no'' vote.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1268.txt,344,INNOCENT PARTY PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,16.0,March
7940,topic-id,1815,"Mr.President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about a couple of my friends. I want to say a few words and praise President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United  I first met Judge Gorsuch several years ago when I met with several circuit court judges for a dinner. He was and has been impressive. Judge Gorsuch is an admirable choice to be America's next Supreme Court His many years of dedication to the law and service to America's judicial system clearly qualify him to serve on America's highest  His work itself speaks highly of his understanding of the Constitution and the values that we, as Americans, hold dear. Some of the first signs Judge Gorsuch would be a great jurist happened just around the corner from here in Washington, DC, where he won a national debate championship in high school.  He attended college at Columbia University and received a scholarship to attend Harvard Law As a new lawyer, he was back here in Washington learning from some of the best jurists in He performed clerkships first to the U.Supreme Court of Appeals for the DC district court and later for Justice Byron White and Anthony Kennedy at the U.Supreme  After working in private practice and at the Department of Justice, in 2006, President George Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to serve as the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit--that is my circuit. The Senate confirmed him by voice vote. Let me say that again. In 2006, this body was so confident about Neil Gorsuch, his character and his qualifications to serve as a Federal judge--yes, a circuit court judge--that he was confirmed without anyone even asking for a recorded vote. I consider that unanimous.  On the bench of the busy Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has proven he takes seriously his duty to uphold the He is known for his legal opinions that stridently defend our[[Page S846]]most fundamental constitutional rights and for writing those opinions in a way that is engaging and easy to understand.  He knows that his work as a judge is about serving this institution, not his personal preferences. As he said recently at the White House, shortly after his nomination was announced by President Trump, ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.''  I love that quote.  As a uniquely exceptional scholar and respected jurist, not to mention a fellow westerner and avid outdoorsman who shares my love of fly fishing, he is the kind of man I trust to serve America on the highest Court of the land.  I have met Judge Gorsuch, and he has a lot of support from folks in Wyoming, in the Wyoming legal community, and from both parties. I got calls from people of both parties saying he is the one we want to put up. I know and I trust those people, and I know and trust Judge Gorsuch, and I value those people's opinions. I believe he has a good understanding of the legal issues that matter to people in my home  I would be remiss if I didn't state my disappointment in all the unproductive distraction about this pick by activists bent on politicizing the judicial nomination process. If their rhetoric and antics in the last days and weeks have told us anything, it is that no matter who President Trump nominated to fill the spot on the Supreme Court, they would have objected--no matter how learned, how objective, or how many hundreds of hours a nominee had already spent on the bench.  In November, millions of people went to the polls and rejected this kind of tired partisan bickering when they voted for a change in Those same voters went to the polls knowing that there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court and that whoever became the next President would choose the nominee.  Mr.President, among our most important duties, as Members of this body, is carefully vetting all nominees who come before us. Never is that responsibility so stark and so substantial as when our Nation faces a vacancy on the Supreme  I believe Judge Neil Gorsuch is up to the solemn and mighty task of serving as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme I look forward to a timely and fair confirmation process focused on Judge Gorsuch's qualifications.  Now I want to talk a little bit about my other friend. I rise in support of President Trump's nominee to serve as the next Attorney General of the United That is my good friend and colleague Senator Jeff Sessions of  Senator Sessions is an admirable and appropriate choice to be America's next Attorney His many years of legal practice, his service as a U.attorney, and as Alabama's attorney general, and 20 years of legislative service in the U.Senate have prepared him well to lead America's Department of His work itself speaks highly of his understanding of the Constitution, of his respect for the law, and of his reverence for the values that we as Americans hold dear. Jeff Sessions is qualified to be the next U.Attorney General because he spent decades studying and practicing the law.  He grew up in a small town in Alabama and worked his way through college before studying law at the University of Senator Sessions began his law practice at a small firm, where he worked on cases involving probate matters, domestic relations, criminal defense, real estate, wills, and civil litigation--what a combination.  He then worked as an assistant U.attorney in the Southern District of Alabama from 1975 to 1977. In that position, he handled a variety of cases at the trial level, including those related to wrongful death, gun violations, forgeries, bank robberies, drugs, and enforcing criminal penalties for pollution.  I am not an attorney myself, but I understand those are exactly the kinds of cases that teach foundational legal skills to a young attorney--managing a docket that may include dozens of cases at any one time; working long hours to track down key evidence and witnesses; developing relationships with investigators and closely advising them to ensure relevant and admissible evidence is gathered lawfully; giving up nights and weekends to prepare witnesses, motions, and arguments for trial to get a case across the finish line; and conferring with victims to assure they are afforded the rights guaranteed to them by law.  That kind of hard work and legal training paid off in 1981, when Senator Sessions was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to serve as the U.Attorney for the Southern District of For the next 12 years Jeff Sessions represented Federal agencies in legal controversies, prosecuted criminal cases, collected debts owed to the government, and defended the civil rights of U.citizens. He did this while also serving his country in the U.Army Reserve from 1973 to 1986. He worked as a transportation officer and later as a military attorney, where the Army no doubt benefited greatly from his years of civilian legal training and practice.  In 1995, Senator Sessions was elected attorney general for the State of Alabama, and he served for 2 years as the State's chief legal officer. Two years later he was elected to the U. I was first elected to the Senate in that same year, and Jeff Sessions has been my friend ever since. But I personally know the man, not just the Senator, and I believe him to be a caring person who wants justice for people and has compassion for people, no matter their backgrounds.  During his 20 years in the Senate, Jeff Sessions has worked on many tough legislative issues that further qualify him to serve as Attorney As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has fought for the confirmation of judges committed to following the law. Consistent with his experience as a prosecutor, he has led successful legislative efforts to improve law and order, many times working with his colleagues across the aisle. He worked with another of my good friends, the late Senator Ted Kennedy, on legislation to reduce sexual assaults in prisons. He worked with Senator Durbin to pass legislation in 2010 to bring fairness to Federal drug sentencing and provide tougher penalties to repeat drug traffickers.  But his efforts haven't been limited to the Judiciary As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he has been a strong advocate for America's military and for those who serve in it. In 2006, he worked with Senator Lieberman to pass a law increasing death benefits for family members of fallen combat personnel and to increase Servicemembers Group Life Insurance benefits.  He has worked to restrain the growth of Federal spending and rebalance Federal funding for HIV/AIDS treatment through the Ryan White CARE Those are just a few of his many legislative accomplishments as a U. Jeff Sessions is a well-educated attorney, an accomplished prosecutor, and a skilled legislator. But I also believe his character, work ethic, and temperament make him well-suited to serve as the chief law enforcement officer of the Federal  As I mentioned, he has been my friend and colleague for over 20 years. So I am proud to personally attest to this. He is a man who is guided by his principles. He is very active in his family's church back in Mobile and in the entire Methodist community of He and his wife Mary have raised three wonderful children who have given them ten grandchildren.  I believe Senator Sessions has the experience, character, and drive to be a fantastic Attorney If confirmed, he is committed to strengthening partnerships between Federal and local law enforcement officers to fight crime, and, specifically, to take out drug cartels and criminal gangs. He has vowed to prosecute criminals who use guns in committing crimes. And he will prosecute individuals who repeatedly violate America's immigration laws.  In November millions of voters went to the polls and voted for change. I believe the priorities Senator Sessions will pursue if confirmed as Attorney General are shared by those voters. I would note the many organizations and individuals who have endorsed his nomination, including the Fraternal Order[[Page S847]]of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and 25 State attorneys general. These are people at the frontlines of law enforcement, and I think they know what it takes to make a great Attorney  Among our most important duties as Members of this body is to carefully vet all nominees that come before us. We have before us an opportunity to support the nomination of a man of high moral character, whose training, education, and professional experience make him extremely well-qualified to serve our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as our next U.Attorney  I yield the floor.

7860,topic-id,240,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.43 which is another baseless and dangerous attack on women's health care providers.  The title X Family Planning Rule, passed almost 50 years ago, already requires states to base title X funding on a provider's ability to provide title X services. This rule protects title X providers from facing unwarranted discrimination and allows them to continue doing the important work 4 million Americans rely on every year. Title X services include family planning services, cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and basic care. To diminish these services will result in women, men and young people with the greatest need being denied the opportunity to have any health care.  Whether or not a provider provides safe and legal abortions with private funds is irrelevant to their ability and capacity to provide title X services. In fact, it is preventive services and family planning offered through title X programs that help to lower the number of unintended pregnancies. But attacks on these providers and the services they offer in their communities persist.  This resolution rolls back protections that should already be guaranteed, but repeated attacks on family planning providers have resulted in the need for rules like the one this resolution dismantles. That is why I strenuously oppose this resolution.

8102,topic-id,879,"Mr.Speaker, I stood in the well of this House some days ago, when I was sworn in, and basically said that I amnot naive.  Today, I rise in support of the Affordable Care Act and oppose any effort to repeal it, which just took place. Since the ACAwas enacted in 2010, the uninsured rate in Pennsylvania has fallen by 37 percent. Additionally, millions more Pennsylvanians,who would otherwise be uninsured, have coverage with an employer, Medicaid, individual market, or Medicare coverage as a resultof the new protections provided by the law.  No matter what lens you look through, Pennsylvanians and individuals throughout our Nation have better health coverage andcare today as a result of the Let us keep moving forward and help our communities have healthcare access, quality, andaffordability.  Recently, our Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, sent a letter to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to underscore theimportance of furthering access to care, keeping prices affordable and spending in check, and improving health care for those inour home State of  Just in Pennsylvania alone, we have had over 670,000 individuals who have enrolled in HealthChoices, Pennsylvania'smandatory managed care Medicaid program. That is 670,000 individuals who previously did not have access to quality of care.  We do not need the rhetoric of repeal and replace.                                      Commonwealthof Pennsylvania,                                       Office of the Governor,                                Harrisburg, PA, December 20, 2016.     Kevin McCarthy,     House ofRepresentatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman McCarthy: Thank you for the opportunity      toweigh in on the critically important conversation about the      future of health care in our country. As Governor of      theCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, I am immensely proud of the      work we have done to further access to care, keep prices      affordableand spending in check, and improve health outcomes      since my administration began tackling health care as a top      priority.       Oneof my first decisions as Governor was to expand Medicaid      to individuals up to 138 percent of Federal Poverty Level      (FPL). Sincethat decision was made in February 2015, more      than 670,000 individuals have enrolled in HealthChoices,      Pennsylvania's mandatorymanaged care Medicaid program. That's      670,000 Pennsylvanians that previously did not have access to      quality care, if they hadaccess to care at all. Total program      enrollment now tops 2.8 million U.Census      data shows that thecommonwealth's uninsured rate has dropped      from 10.2 percent in 2010 to 6.4 percent in 2015, and state      General Fund costs havebeen reduced by more than $500 million      as a result of Medicaid expansion.       Even before the passage of the Affordable Care Act,Medicaid      was the largest single payer in the United States for      behavioral health services, including mental health and      substanceuse services. In the midst of an exploding heroin      use and opioid abuse epidemic that is gripping Pennsylvania      and the nation,the role that Medicaid pays in addressing this      epidemic cannot be understated. More than 3,500      Pennsylvanians died from heroinand opioid-related overdoses      last year and that number is expected to rise again in 2016.      However, in the first year ofPennsylvania's Medicaid      expansion, almost 63,000 newly eligible Medicaid enrollees      accessed drug and alcohol treatment. Demandson the treatment      system are growing by the day but Medicaid expansion has      opened the door to treatment that otherwise would notbe      available, much less affordable, to those without insurance.       Of course, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)      arenot limited to those with The ACA has had far-     reaching positive impacts on every community in Pennsylvania      In 2016,more than 439,000 people had selected health coverage      through the       Seventy six percent of those Pennsylvaniansreceived      subsidies to make those plans more affordable. In 2016, 60      percent of those enrollees could obtain coverage for $100      orless after tax credits. For a family, that may be the      difference between choosing to pay for food for dinner or      having stablehealth insurance. In addition, several pieces of      the ACA, including the provision that allows children to      remain on theirparents' insurance until age 26 and the      provision that requires coverage of pre-existing conditions,      have made the benefits ofhealth insurance coverage more      enticing than ever before.       Nonprofits that have historically served as the safety nets      of ourhealth care system saw some relief with the passage of      the For many, this meant they could finally bill for      some of theservices that they've typically provided for free      for individuals who are uninsured. To shift the burden back      on to theseproviders to serve an enormous influx of people      who would lose access to insurance under an ACA repeal is      doing a disservice toour nonprofit partners and our      communities. The upheaval would be instant and real and would      devastate families that havefinally been able to set aside      health coverage from their list of daily worries.       I respectfully ask that you carefullyconsider the needs of      the people as you move forward with discussions about the      future of the All too often we get swept upin the      politics and financial impacts to large businesses and big      political donors and forget that these are real people,      whosuffer from real diseases and every day maladies.      Americans need real, meaningful health care coverage.

They needleadership and compassion and      solutions--and together, we can provide them with all of      those things.       I look forward to futureconversations.

Since this bill was marked up in the last Congress, the very same plausibility standard used in this bill was adopted by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in which fraudulent joinder cases arise with the greatest frequency.  Last Congress, Ranking Member Conyers said of the bill, it should simply pick one of the existing articulations in the fraudulent joinder standard and codify that into law. At the time, the plausibility approach was applied by some district courts, but just last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the same plausibility standard this bill contains in a case called International  The Fifth Circuit stated: We must consider whether the plaintiff pleaded ``enough facts to state a claim to relieve that is plausible on its face.'' The plaintiff in that case petitioned for rehearing en banc, but the rehearing was denied, with not a single judge on the Fifth Circuit requesting a vote.  In just the last year, district courts in the Fifth Circuit have issued more than 40 fraudulent joinder decisions without much difficulty and with the results that indicate just the sort of reasonable reform that would occur nationwide when we get this bill passed into law.

7748,topic-id,324,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be roundly opposed for the simple reason it doesn't protect any victims, but it also victimizes local parties in the types of cases covered by the amendment.  The purpose of the underlying bill is to allow judges greater discretion to free innocent local parties--that is, innocent people and innocent small businesses--from lawsuits when those innocent local parties are dragged into a case solely because a plaintiff's attorney wants to do some forum shopping.  These innocent local parties have, at most, an attenuated connection to the claims made by the trial lawyer against some national company a thousand miles away. These innocent local parties shouldn't have to suffer the time, expense, and emotional drain of a lawsuit when the plaintiff can't even come up with a plausible claim. The base bill protects these innocent local parties from being dragged into a lawsuit as a party just to keep the case in State court.  Now, let's bring in this amendment, which denies the bill's protection to innocent local parties adjoined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category and that one is in another.

7757,topic-id,593,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment continues to victimize innocent local parties just because they happen to be in an insurance case.  The underlying bill is designed to protect folks from being dragged into a lawsuit just to facilitate forum shopping by plaintiffs' attorneys.  The purpose of this bill is to allow judges greater discretion to free these innocent local parties. They are the ones that are suffering as a result of this.  This amendment denies the bill's protection to innocent local parties joined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category rather than another, just like the previous amendment. It is terribly unfair. Innocent people are innocent people, and they should be protected from being dragged into a lawsuit regardless of the nature of the case.  The rules we have developed in this great country to protect the innocent are rules of general application, such as the rules protecting people's rights to have their side of the story told and the rules protecting people from biased or inaccurate testimony.  We should all be appalled by the suggestion that these general protections designed to protect innocent people from criminal liability should be suspended because the case is one of assault and battery or murder or somehow relates to insurance. It is the same kind of logic.                              {time}  1545  Our country is rightfully proud of its principles providing due process and equal protection, but these concepts are meaningless if they are only selectively applied to some type of cases and not others. And for the same reason, we should all be outraged at the suggestion that the rules of fairness, designed to protect the innocent, should be suspended in civil law cases because a case involves one particular subject matter or another. But that is exactly what this misguided amendment does.  This amendment would allow a plaintiff's lawyer to drag an individual insurance adjuster into a lawsuit even when the applicable State law makes it absolutely clear that only insurers, not individual people, are subject to bad faith claims. How does the sponsor explain this to a person like Jack Stout, why a lawyer pulled him into a bad faith lawsuit targeting State Farm? Mr.Stout was a local insurance agent who merely sold a policy to the plaintiff, met and spoke with the plaintiff once, and had nothing to do with processing the plaintiff's homeowner's insurance claim. A Federal District Court in Oklahoma found he was fraudulently joined and dismissed the claim against him, but under this amendment, the innocent person would have been stuck back in the lawsuit.  What about a person like Douglas Bradley, where the plaintiff's lawyer named him as a defendant in a bad faith lawsuit against an insurer? In that case, the complaint included Mr.Bradley, an insurance agent, as a defendant in the caption of the case. It referred to defendant, singular, not defendants. Throughout the entire pleadings, it didn't even mention his name. A Federal District Court in Indiana dismissed this claim against him as fraudulently joined, but under this amendment, this innocent person would have been stuck back in the lawsuit. It is not fair, it is expensive, and it is emotionally draining to these innocent parties.  For that reason, I urge opposition to the amendment and support of the underlying bill.

7920,topic-id,5832,"Mr.President, thank you very much, and I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his remarks. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with him, and we have a number of major issues forthcoming.  I rise to oppose the nomination of Senator Sessions to become the Attorney General of the United I think some of us and I certainly have lived through many difficult times in this country, but today this country is as divided as I have ever seen it.  Some Republicans have said that Democrats are in the anger stage of grief, but with all due respect, those statements just trivialize what is going on in this country. It is not trivial, and it is not small. Today America is a country split in half, with at least half objecting to the actions of this President, including his nominee for Attorney  My office has received approximately 114,000 calls and emails regarding Senator Sessions, with 112,000--more than 98 percent--opposed to this nominee. I would like to quote a few of my constituents who deeply oppose this President and this nominee and have been taking to the streets to protect the fundamental values of  Here is one from a doctor:       I marched because of the thousands of patients I've seen in      the community, people of color, immigrants from all over the      globe, who are terrified about the loss of their rights and      the dramatic explosion of racially and culturally focused      hate crimes we're reading about.       I marched on Saturday because women must not be denigrated,      as we've seen by the attitude exemplified by our new      President in his unmeasured remarks.       I marched on Saturday because I'm desperately worried that      the progress this country has made in recognizing the rights      of all Americans regardless of race, ethnicity and religious      belief, is now threatened with a roll-back to the `50s.       The American process of justice is a beacon and an example      to the world. Jeff Sessions must not be confirmed.  Here is another:       As a Californian who wants to finish school, as a      Californian with ``pre-existing conditions,'' as a Latina and      as the kid of a South American immigrant--I don't know what I      can say other than please, please, protect us from whatever      is coming as best you can.  One woman who marched after the inauguration came to my office the following Monday and wrote a handwritten note explaining why she marched. Here is what it said:       Our President quickly dismisses all protesters as      ``professionals'' and ``sore losers.'' I am here in      Washington for his first full week of the presidency to send      the message that I am neither a ``professional'' nor a ``sore      loser''--just an ordinary American citizen who can no longer      sleep well at night worrying about how his agenda will      negatively impact not only our country, but democracies all      over the globe. America is already great; what Trump and his      administration will do is destroy it.  To my constituents--112,000 have called and emailed to oppose this nominee--let me just say this: I hear you.  To my Republican colleagues, this is not grief about losing an election. At no time when my party lost an election or when the President was of a different party did I feel the way I feel today. For most Presidents, there is hope--a hope of unity, a hope of bringing people together, a sense of common purpose. That is what it means to be a leader of this country, the whole country--red States and blue States, all of our people.  President Obama began his tenure in office with a 69-percent approval rating. President George Bush talked about compassionate conservatism. After a terrorist attack killed nearly 3,000 people, President Bush went to the Islamic Center in Washington on September 17, 2001, and said: ``Islam is peace.''  He said:       Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of      the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And      they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and      emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with      respect.  Incidentally, President Eisenhower dedicated the Islamic Center in 1957, and here is what he said then:       Under the American Constitution, under American tradition,      and in American hearts, this Center, this place of worship,      is just as welcome as could be a similar edifice of any other      religion. Indeed, America would fight with her whole strength      for your right to have here your own church and worship      according to your own conscience.  Now, Mr.President, that was the man who led American and Allied forces in Europe against Nazi Germany, a regime of pure evil that targeted Jews based on their religion and exterminated millions of Jews, Poles, Serbs, Roma, Soviet citizens, gays, lesbians, and many others. President Eisenhower was saying that this country, the United States of America, would fight with her whole strength to protect the religious freedom of ``Without that concept,'' President Eisenhower said, ``we would be something else than what we are.''  Can anybody even imagine Donald Trump uttering words like two of his Republican predecessors, Dwight Eisenhower and George Bush?  Instead, there is attack after attack after attack on minorities, on immigrants, on Muslims, on women, on his critics, on judges, on the press, and yes, even on truth itself.  There is the President's Muslim ban Executive order, which our government says has caused between 60,000 and 100,000 visas to be revoked. That order, which caused chaos at airports around the country, is now subject to nearly 60 legal challenges in Federal courts. On Friday, a Federal judge in Washington State blocked implementation of major portions of the Executive order. The judge, appointed by President George Bush, was then promptly attacked on Twitter by President Donald This afternoon, the Ninth Circuit will review the stay.  To say this is just a stage of grief after losing an election is really to ignore reality.[[Page S827]]  Last week Sally Yates had to stand up and tell the President no. Now more than ever, it is clear how important it is that the Department of Justice be independent from the When she stood up, she was promptly fired by this And not only was she fired, but her integrity and her character were maligned in an over-the-top press statement. This woman is a career prosecutor with 27 years of experience. She was the lead prosecutor in the terrorist prosecution of 1996 Olympic bomber Eric She actually went after a real terrorist, and she got a conviction. The President called her a ``disgrace'' and ``weak on borders.''  Here is the point: This is the man for whom Senator Sessions has been a stalwart campaign advocate. In response to my written questions, Senator Sessions stated: ``I endorsed him in part because he was a leader advocating for issues I supported and believed in.''  Senator Sessions was a close campaign adviser and supporter of the He was the first Senator to endorse him. He spoke on Trump's behalf at the National Republican He appeared at numerous rallies. He attended at least 45 campaign events. During the campaign, he spoke at large rallies, smiling and laughing, while crowds chanted ``Lock her up.''  Then in October of last year, at one of the Presidential debates and again at a rally in Virginia, Candidate Trump repeatedly referred to him as ``my attorney general.''  A month after the announcement of his nomination to be Attorney General, he appeared again with the President-elect on a thank-you tour in This was a rally where many of the President's campaign promises, such as building the wall, were repeated. Crowds once again chanted ``Lock her up.'' The President-elect introduced him, and Senator Sessions came forward. As he walked out to speak to dramatic effect, he whipped out a ``Make America Great Again'' hat, put it on, and pumped his fists into the air.  Already, at this point, he had been designated to be the next Attorney General of the United States, an independent legal check on the President, a man who responds to the Constitution and the law independent of the Chief One would have thought a sense of the solemn duty of the Office of Attorney General would have counseled against appearing at yet another political rally with Trump, but it did not.  At that rally, as Attorney General designate, Sessions said that the Trump campaign was ``more than a normal campaign, but a movement,'' and when he finished speaking, he thanked the President-elect for ``the opportunity to participate in a movement that I believe can help make America great again.''  So, to me, this is key. This shows how Senator Sessions views this appointment--as an ``opportunity to participate in a movement'' to advance the President's agenda. This is not the role of the Attorney General of the United This is more political than any Attorney General nominee in recent memory has ever been. Can we really expect him to be an Attorney General who is independent from President Trump? I do not believe so.  In fact, a recent Washington Post story reports the depth of Senator Sessions' involvement in the Trump transition. The Washington Post reported that during the transition, ``Sessions became a daily presence at Trump Tower in New York, mapping out the policy agenda and making personnel decisions.'' In fact, you can search C-SPAN, the Web site, for video of Senator Sessions speaking at Trump Tower about the transition.  On November 15, in the lobby of Trump Tower, he said:       My former chief of staff is doing a great job under      incredible demands, and the whole team is working long hours      I mean, 20 hours a day kind of work and just remarkable what      is happening. I'm one of the co-chairs, of five, I believe,      co-chairs of the committee under Vice President-elect  Then Senator Sessions said, ``Steve Bannon is a powerful intellect and a thoughtful leader that consistently provides good advice.''  We learned last week that Steve Bannon thinks the same thing about Senator As Bannon wrote to the Washington Post just days ago, Sessions was--and I quote, and here it is--``the fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''  The Post went on to report that Senator Sessions ``lobbied for a `shock-and-awe' period of executive action that would rattle Congress, impress Trump's base, and catch his critics unaware, according to two officials involved in the transition planning.''  The article says: ``Sessions had advocated going even faster.''  Now, we have seen the consequences of those actions, and what is the result? Division, legal challenges, people marching in the streets.  Senator Sessions is not a man apart from this agenda. He is not independent of this agenda. He is part of it. He is committed to it. He is a leader of it.  Now, let me move to other parts of Senator Sessions' record and what we learned from him in the hearing.  I said earlier that I cannot imagine a more important time for the Department of Justice to be independent of the Part of that is because of what we know about the Russians and their illegal efforts to get this President elected.  The Intelligence Community has reached the following conclusions about Russian activities during the election, among others: ``We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential election.''  Quote: ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the United States Democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''  Quote: ``We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''  Quote: ``We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.''  Quote: ``We assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.''  These are just some of the conclusions that our intelligence agencies--all of them--have reached, including the  The Department of Justice, through the National Security Division and the FBI, has an important role to play in investigating and prosecuting Russians or coconspirators in this matter. The FBI, as I said, was part of the assessment that led to the January report.  Now, Senator Sessions chaired the President's National Security Advisory Committee during the campaign. That is a committee on which National Security Advisor Flynn served. So he was Trump's top person on national security, and it is no secret that explosive allegations about the President's and his campaign team's connections to Russia are out there.  As a Senator, including as a member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Sessions was quite critical of In 2000, he said Russia is a country where leaders lie, cheat, and steal to maintain political office.  That was a floor speech on April 13, 2000.  In 2014, after Russia invaded Crimea, Senator Sessions said, ``I believe a systematic effort should be undertaken so that Russia feels pain for this.''  This was in the Montgomery Advertiser, March 19, 2014.  When he was a Senator in the 1990s, he and other Republican Judiciary Committee members called for a special prosecutor because of allegations of $1 million in Chinese monetary contributions to a Presidential campaign.  That is from a floor speech on March 9, 2000.  He pointed to the campaign connection and said that meant the Attorney General needed to appoint a special prosecutor. He said: ``This is serious business. We ought not to treat this lightly.''  Floor speech, March 9, 2000.  Yet, now that our intelligence community has concluded that Russia, at[[Page S828]]the direction of Vladimir Putin, invaded the American political process with massive hacks and leaks for the purpose of favoring candidate Trump, Senator Sessions says that he has not even reviewed the intelligence community's reports.  When asked in writing by myself in Question for the Record 2b after his hearing whether he had even read the intelligence assessments, classified or unclassified, he said he had not read either one.  Now, that is stunning. One of the most important national security revelations in recent years, and he is nominated to be Attorney General, and he hasn't reviewed it? Why? He attended 45 campaign events, was intimately involved in the campaign and transition, but despite all of this, he would not commit himself to recuse himself.  This should be of real concern to all of us.  Another nation--namely, Russia--has attacked our political process in a major way: hacking a political party and leaking its internal deliberations. This time, it targeted the Democratic Party; next time, it could be the Republican Party, but whichever party it is, we can't let this continue.  Intelligence and law enforcement professionals must be able to follow the facts wherever they lead. The investigation could lead to the prosecution of people who helped hack and leak information hacked by Russia to help the President's campaign. It obviously has the potential to create embarrassment for the President and his people, and to implicate people involved in the campaign.  So the question is a big one, and we ought to think about it. How will this nominee handle investigation and prosecution into an unprecedented and major foreign intrusion into the election of the President of the United States? Can he be independent of the White House? I do not believe he can.  Let me move on to voting rights. Senator Sessions long ago testified that he thought the Voting Rights Act was an intrusive piece of legislation. He acknowledged this again in his hearing. In 1986, Senator Sessions said: ``It is a serious thing . . . for the Federal Government to come in and sue a county and say we are going to change the form of government you have been living with for 20 years.''  That implies a hesitation to use the Voting Rights Act to change certain systems of election in counties that were adopted to disenfranchise minorities.  When we considered the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization of 2006, the Senator voted for it. But he also expressed skepticism about the preclearance provision of the act, section 5, which was a core part of the act. And then, when the Supreme Court narrowly ruled five to four in Shelby County--that is a decision--and that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act could no longer be enforced, Senator Sessions called it ``good news for the South.''  What does that mean? It means State after State that had been prevented from denying the right to vote by section 5 can now proceed unless they are affirmatively stopped by a new lawsuit that takes time to develop, and a wave of new laws suppressing the vote were quickly passed following the Supreme Court's ruling.  He has tried to argue that he will fully enforce the Voting Rights In his committee questionnaire, he pointed to 4 cases he claimed were among the 10 most significant litigated cases he personally handled. As Senator Franken demonstrated in our committee, his record of handling these cases is thin, at best. Lawyers who handled three of the cases say Senator Sessions had no substantive involvement. He did not mention them in his 1986 questionnaire, even though the cases were ongoing at that time. And now he says he played a supporting or assistance role in them.  So these cases do not make me confident that as Attorney General overseeing the Civil Rights Division, he will ensure that the civil rights and voting rights laws are fairly enforced.  So I asked him questions to see what he would do. I pointed out in written questions that several voter ID laws have now been struck down, or severely limited, under the Voting Rights Just one example: One of the most conservative appeals courts in the Nation, the Fifth Circuit, found that Texas's law violates the Voting Rights According to the courts, 608,470 registered voters in Texas lack required ID, and Black and Latino voters were far more likely than White voters to lack the required The court found that the Texas law had a discriminatory effect, in violation of the Voting Rights  Now, this means the Justice Department can protect the voting rights of Americans in these cases. So I asked him, would you continue to enforce the Voting Rights Act in these situations? There is now precedent for it. He would not answer. He tried to say that the Supreme Court has actually held that voter ID laws do not necessarily violate the Voting Rights  That is my written question for the record, 14.  But the Supreme Court decision he referenced, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, did not talk about the Voting Rights Act at all.  So I asked him to clarify his response. His answer indicated that it was just his own view that voter ID laws do not necessarily violate the Voting Rights This was a follow-up question, 7a. That may be his personal view, but the courts' view is that these laws can and in some circumstances do violate the Voting Rights But he still has refused to say whether he will bring those cases.  Then, when asked about voter fraud by Senator Coons, Senator Sessions responded that he believes ``fraudulent activities regularly occur'' during elections. He pointed to a single report to support his view that voter ID laws are a good idea. That is Senator Coons' question for the record 9b. He refused to comment on data provided by Senator Coons that showed the rarity of in-person voter impersonation fraud, which is the only thing a voter ID law can catch. He didn't comment about the impact on hundreds of thousands of legitimate voters, many of them minorities and students, who are denied the fundamental right to vote by these laws.  Now we have the President on Twitter and television claiming that millions of illegal votes were cast and that is why he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and he is ordering his administration to investigate that. If President Trump asks Attorney General Sessions to carry out his partisan, pointless investigation, what will Senator Sessions do? Is the legendary Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department going to become President Trump's political investigator? Or will it defend and use the Voting Rights Act to protect the right to vote of millions of Americans against efforts by States to take that right away? I just don't have confidence that Jeff Sessions will fairly apply the law in this area.  Now, if confirmed, what will Senator Sessions do when faced with questions on reproductive rights? Will he undermine a woman's fundamental right to control her own body and her own reproductive system?  In 2015, Senator Sessions voted for legislation that would impose a nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks. That legislation had a penalty of jailing doctors for up to 5 years, and it would have forced survivors of rape and incest to overcome additional and medically unnecessary hurdles before they could receive an abortion. The legislation also had no exception for a woman's health and only a narrow exception to save her life.  Imagine what it is like to be a woman who learns that she has serious complications late in pregnancy and that she will suffer debilitating physical health effects if she cannot get an abortion. Then imagine having to tell her that her health must suffer for the rest of her life because politicians have prohibited her from making her own health care decisions. But this is the outcome Senator Sessions voted for.  Senator Sessions believes the case that established a woman's right to control her own reproductive system--Roe v. Wade--is one of the ``worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time.'' In fact, weeks ago when testifying before our committee, I asked him if this is still his view, and he said ``it is.'' He even said Roe v. Wade ``violated the Constitution.''  That statement essentially invites States to enact more and more restrictions on women's fundamental access to health care. It is a signal to those[[Page S829]]States that if they enact restrictions and are challenged in court, then the Justice Department may in fact support them and try to overturn Roe v. In fact, I asked him about that, and he did not rule out the Justice Department's pushing to overturn He left the door open by saying:       Such decisions would depend upon the unique circumstances      of the case or cases as they arise. I will not pre-judge the      issues.  That is the response to my question for the record 6a.  He even refused to rule out punishment for women who have abortions--a position President Trump took during the campaign. That is a response to Senator Blumenthal's question for the record 11a.  So what does it mean for him, as Attorney General of the United States? It means he very well may seek to overturn Roe v. It means the Justice Department may go to court and support continued State efforts to further and further restrict the rights of women to control their own reproductive system.  The bottom line: I do not have confidence that Senator Sessions will fairly and independently safeguard the freedoms of the women of  Let me move on to immigration. Senator Sessions has been the staunchest opponent of comprehensive immigration reform, preventing the passage of legislation to strengthen the border and prevent families from being torn apart.  Senator Sessions opposed immigration reform so strenuously that he drafted and distributed his own book entitled ``Immigration Handbook for the New Republican Majority.'' This handbook implied that immigrants were taking jobs from low-income minorities and abusing public benefit programs--setting people against each other. More alarmingly, Senator Sessions voted at least twice against the DREAM Act, which seeks to protect some of our country's most vulnerable youth, undocumented individuals--children--who were brought here through no choice of their own.  On President Obama's Executive action to protect those children--known as DACA--he doesn't just oppose it. He is actively seeking to take it down. A recent Washington Post article says he is lobbying for the administration to overturn It is one thing to disagree on policy, but it is quite another when the policy could crush the lives of ordinary people.  In December, I wrote an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about the importance of DACA and what it means for  I discussed the story of Denisse Rojas, brought to the United States as a 10-month-old baby. Rojas' family is similar to many families with mixed status. Her mother and father came to the United States to create a better life for their children.  Denisse excelled in high school and majored in biology at UC She worked as a waitress and commuted an hour each way to classes because she couldn't afford to live near campus. After graduation, she volunteered at San Francisco General Denisse dreamed of going to medical school, driven in part by a family member's early death from cancer. The disease was diagnosed at a late stage because the family's immigration status made it impossible to afford health insurance.  Today, Rojas is enrolled in New York's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, where she is on track to earn her degree in 2019. She intends to specialize in emergency medicine and work in low-income communities to provide health care to families, like her own, who would otherwise go without necessary treatment.  This is the perfect case for discretion. This is the perfect case for the exercise of a just humanity. But Senator Sessions is lobbying to overturn The consequences of such a draconian and inhumane action would be devastating to thousands of people in my State, and I find it deeply disturbing that Senator Sessions would advocate for the deportation of children who have known no other country but the United  If he doesn't believe these youth deserve some sort of prosecutorial discretion when it comes to deportation, how is he going to act as our Nation's leading Federal criminal prosecutor?  It is no secret that he believes in an aggressive use of executive enforcement power in the area of immigration. He testified in response to Senator Flake that he favors ``a zero tolerance'' policy for immigration crimes. Immigration offenses already make up about a third of all Federal prosecutions each year. So does it make sense to increase that substantially? There certainly are more troubling crimes at the border and across the country that require the attention and resources of the Department of Justice: human trafficking, smugglers, organized crime, gangs, drug trafficking, hate crimes, white-collar crimes, civil rights, and voting rights, just to name a few. So Senator Sessions' opposition to prosecutorial discretion caused me great concern.  Let's move on to criminal law.  During the hearing, discussing sentencing with Senator Coons, Senator Sessions revealed his view about what a Federal prosecutor should be. He said it was ``a problematic thing'' that is ``difficult to justify'' when a prosecutor uses some discretion to bring lesser charges or not to charge the maximum drug charge available.  As we know, drug prosecutions were the most common Federal charge in 2015. So Senator Sessions' view on them will have a big impact on the workload in U.attorneys' offices. If it becomes the nationwide policy of the Department, it will mean mandatory sentences of 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and even life in prison for drug charges will be imposed much more often, because depending on how prosecutors charge cases, the law will tie a judge's hands when it comes to a sentence. That is how our system works today.  The mission of a prosecutor is to do justice, not instinctively bring the maximum charge. As then-Attorney General Robert Jackson said in 1940:       The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and      reputation than any other person in His discretion      is tremendous.       Your positions are of such independence and importance that      while you are being diligent, strict, and vigorous in law      enforcement, you can also afford to be just. Although the      government technically loses its case, it has really won if      justice has been done.  For Senator Sessions to say that a prosecutor cannot exercise some judgment, based on the circumstances of a case, to seek a lesser charge or a lesser punishment, in my view, is just not correct.  We have discussed mandatory minimum sentencing in the Judiciary The Senator from Illinois, distinguished as he is, has been a leader in this cause. It has been discussed for years in the context of the sentencing reform efforts led by Senators Lee, Cornyn, Durbin, Grassley, Leahy, and Senator Lee, in particular, has been a passionate advocate against mandatory minimum sentencing.  I believe in enforcement of the drug laws. I always have. There are difficult questions about what actions the Justice Department would take in States that have legalized marijuana in some way or another under their own laws.  The bottom line is this: sensitivity and good judgment are needed in prosecutorial decisions. We want to make sure the sentence fits the crime and that resources are used wisely. Senator Sessions' comments make it clear that he generally opposes granting discretion to a prosecutor to impose a lesser charge or a lesser sentence based on the circumstances of the case before them.  One thing I found striking was that in Senator Sessions' written statement to the committee, he said the following: ``I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community.''  I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 24 years. Twenty of them have been alongside Senator I cannot recall a single time when he spoke about supporting any kind of ``justice and fairness'' for the LGBT community or made any kind of statement like this. We looked and couldn't find one in the Congressional Record either. In fact, the statement stands at odds with his record.  Let me give you a few examples. In 2011, we marked up a bill I had introduced to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, that denied married gay and lesbian couples equal protection under the law. Not only did Senator Sessions vote no--as[[Page S830]]all Republicans on the committee did--but he asked questions like, ``What about two sisters?''--as if to compare same-sex marriage to incest, a demeaning statement about hundreds of thousands of families in this country.  He voted against allowing gay and lesbian Americans to serve in the military. In 2009, he voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes He said he did not see the kind of discrimination happening against the LGBT community or women. He said the law was potentially unconstitutional, which is not an argument that, to my knowledge, has ever been accepted by a court.  In 2006, he voted to enshrine discrimination in our Constitution by supporting the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage everywhere in the country. What did he say? He said the Senate had to debate the amendment because of a ``deliberate and sustained effort by leftists in America,'' ``social activists,'' and ``activist judges.''  He talked about harm to children, ignoring the fact that same-sex couples are raising children and that denying equal recognition to their families actually hurts those children. Then he went on to criticize the 2003 decision of the Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas, which essentially said that private homosexual conduct cannot be made a crime in this  The Lawrence decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, was a victory for freedom. How did Senator Sessions describe it? He argued the decision was wrong, and ``troubling with far-reaching ramifications.'' He said it was a ``new vision of social justice, masquerading . . . as constitutional law.''  He called Justice Scalia's dissent ``brilliant.'' That dissent, by the way, accused the Supreme Court of ``sign[ing] on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.''  When he was Attorney General of Alabama, he sought to shut down a conference of LGBT students on a public university campus in This was despite a Supreme Court decision issued just a year earlier protecting a Christian student group from discrimination based on viewpoint.  The Eleventh Circuit Court--in a panel of three judges appointed by Republican Presidents--called the State's action ``blatant viewpoint discrimination'' and characterized Sessions' arguments as ``feeble.''  Does any of this sound like the actions of a person who understands the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community? My answer is no.  How will that impact the Attorney General? The Attorney General must enforce Federal hate crimes laws. The Attorney General must ensure that Federal law treats same-sex couples equally; that the right to marry and be treated equally under Federal law is recognized and protected.  Here we are, I think, at a very difficult and dangerous turning point. We have a President with little apparent regard for constitutional or legal restrictions and who is willing to take to Twitter to target and abuse individuals and groups of Americans, and even belittle and demean Federal judges and the Federal court system, just as he did during the campaign.  We have a President who has taken a ``shock and awe'' approach with cruel, un-American, and potentially illegal Executive orders even in his first 2 weeks in office, which this nominee reportedly urged be done even faster.  We have a President who wants to bring back torture, even though--thanks to Senator McCain--Congress has already stated it is clearly illegal. We have a President who is already angering long-term allies like Australia and making ridiculous threats of sending troops to  We have a nominee for Attorney General who is anything but independent. He was part and parcel of the Trump campaign apparatus, transition, agenda, and way of thinking.  As Steve Bannon wrote in the Washington Post just days ago, Sessions was ``the fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''  Do any of my colleagues--Republican or Democratic--think Steve Bannon didn't know what he was talking about in this email to the Washington Post? Do any of my colleagues believe that if Senator Sessions is confirmed, he is going to take off the political hat and be an even-handed Attorney General for all Americans who will tell this President no when it is merited on the basis of the law and the Constitution?  I don't believe it for a second. I must vote no and urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven).

8044,topic-id,357,"Mr.Speaker, one of the things I appreciate most about the job that I have to represent Hawaii's Second District is to be able to respond to and provide assistance to the hundreds of veterans from across my State that contact our office every single year. They call to ask for help with things like compensation and pension issues, health care, mileage reimbursement, especially for our veterans who live on the neighboring islands where they don't have a VA clinic on an island, education, home loan benefits, and more. This is a responsibility as a Member of Congress and as a fellow veteran that I take very seriously.  Right now, if a veteran contacts my office for assistance, we are required to go directly through the congressional liaison at the We act as the veterans advocate to try to get answers for them on things that they haven't been able to get answers on, things that they haven't heard back on.  Too often, we are faced with the bureaucratic layers within the VA and a slow turnaround that leave congressional staff, like mine and my colleagues here, jumping through hoops to access basic, but critical, information on behalf of our veterans and their families. At times, we have waited for months to get answers from the VA on behalf of a Hawaii veteran for something that should be a quick turnaround, like a status update. This is unacceptable.  I am proud to cosponsor the WINGMAN Act, legislation introduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Yoho), my friend and colleague, which allows us to cut through the red tape and ensure that our certified caseworkers within our offices can provide quicker, more efficient, and effective service to our veterans. It would help streamline the veterans claims process by allowing congressional offices on behalf of our veteran constituents to directly access the status of pending claims, rating decisions, statement of the case, and so on.  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation so that all of us working here in the people's House can better serve our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our communities and our country.

7735,topic-id,1095,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, hardworking Americans are some of the leading victims of frivolous lawsuits and the extraordinary costs that our legal system imposes.  Every day, local businessowners routinely have lawsuits filed against them based on claims that have no substantive connection to them as a means of forum shopping on the part of the lawyers filing the case. These lawsuits present a tremendous burden on small businesses and their employees.  The Innocent Party Protection Act, introduced by Judiciary Committee member Mr.Buck of Colorado, will help reduce the litigation abuse that regularly drags small businesses into court for no other reason than as part of a lawyer's forum shopping strategy.  In order to avoid the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, plaintiffs' attorneys regularly join instate defendants to the lawsuits they file in State court even if the instate defendants' connections to the controversy are minimal or nonexistent.  Typically the innocent but fraudulently joined instate defendant is a small business or the owner or employee of a small business. Even though these innocent instate defendants ultimately don't face any liability as a result of being named as a defendant, they, nevertheless, have to spend money to hire a lawyer and take valuable time away from running their businesses or spending time with their families to deal with matters related to a lawsuit to which they have no real connection.  To take just a few examples, in Bendy v. C.Fleet Company, the plaintiff brought a product liability claim against a national company for its allegedly defective medicinal drink. The plaintiff also joined a resident local defendant health clinic alleging it negligently instructed the plaintiff to ingest the drink.  The national company removed the case to Federal court and argued that[[Page H1969]]the small, local defendant was fraudulently joined because the plaintiff's claims against the clinic were time barred by the statute of limitations, showing no possibility of recovery.  Despite finding the possibility of relief against the local defendant ``remote,'' the court remanded the case after emphasizing the draconian burden on the national company to show fraudulent joinder under the current rules.  The court practically apologized publicly to the joined party stating: ``The fact that Maryland courts are likely to dismiss Bendy's claims against the local defendant is not sufficient for jurisdiction, given the Fourth Circuit's strict standard for fraudulent joinder.''  Shortly after remand, all claims against the local defendant were dismissed, of course, after its presence in the lawsuit served the trial lawyers' tactical purpose of forum shopping. When courts themselves complain about the unfairness of current court rules, Congress should take notice.  In Baumeister v. Home Depot, Home Depot removed a slip-and-fall case to Federal court. The day after removal and before conducting any discovery, the plaintiff amended the complaint to name a local business, which it alleged failed to maintain the store's parking lot.  The court found the timing of the amended complaint was ``suspect,'' noting the possibility that the sole reason for amending the complaint to add the local defendant as a defendant could have been to defeat diversity jurisdiction.                              {time}  1500  Nevertheless, the court held Home Depot had not met its ``heavy burden'' of showing fraudulent joinder under current law because the court found it was possible, even if it were just a tenth of a percent possible, that the newly added defendant could potentially be held liable and remanded the case back to State court. Once back in State court, the plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the innocent local defendant from the lawsuit, but only after it had been used successfully as a forum-shopping pawn.  Trial lawyers join these unconnected instate defendants to their lawsuits because today a case can be kept in State court by simply joining as a defendant a local party that shares the same local residence as the person bringing the lawsuit. When the primary defendant moves to remove the case to Federal court, the addition of that local defendant will generally defeat removal under a variety of approaches judges currently take to determine whether the joined defendant prevents removal to Federal court.  One approach judges take is to require a showing that there is ``no possibility of recovery'' against the local defendant before a case can be removed to Federal court or some practically equivalent standard. Others require the judge to resolve any doubts regarding removal in favor of the person bringing the lawsuit. Still others require the judge to find that the local defendant was added in bad faith before they allow the case to be removed to Federal court.  The current law is so unfairly heavy-handed against innocent local parties joined to lawsuits that Federal Appeals Court Judge Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has publicly supported congressional action to change the standards for joinder, saying: ``That's exactly the kind of approach to Federal jurisdiction reform I like because it's targeted. And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to establish that the joinder of a nondiverse defendant is totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever recovering . . . that's very hard to do,'' he says. ``So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit more realistic . . . appeals to me because it seems to me the kind of intermediate step that addresses real problems.''  The bill before us today addresses those real problems in two main ways:  First, the bill allows judges greater discretion to free an innocent local party from a case where the judge finds there is no plausible case against that party. That plausibility standard is the same standard the Supreme Court has said should be used to dismiss pleadings for failing to state a valid legal claim, and the same standard should apply to release innocent parties from lawsuits.  Second, the bill allows judges to look at evidence that the trial lawyers aren't acting in good faith in adding local defendants. This is a standard some lower courts already use to determine whether a trial lawyer really intends to pursue claims against the local defendant or is just using them as part of their forum-shopping strategy.  This bill is strongly supported by the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.Chamber of Commerce, among other legal reform advocates. Please join me in supporting this vital legislation to reduce litigation abuse and forum shopping and to protect innocent parties from costly, extended, and unnecessary litigation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1968-2.txt,446,1300,2017.0,9.0,February
7921,topic-id,3268,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the nomination of Senator Sessions to be Attorney General of the United Let me make a few comments about the process. I would expect that the Attorney General nominee know the President before they are chosen. This idea that Senator Sessions was close to President Trump during the campaign and that it is somehow a disqualifier makes absolutely zero sense to me.  The bottom line is, that is exactly the kind of people you would expect a President to pick--someone who has been on their team, someone they know, someone they believe in to carry out the duties of the office that they are nominated for.  I don't have the time to go through history, but I would assume that in past nominations--particularly for Attorney General--there has been some kind of relationship between the President who nominated him and the person who is seeking the job. If that is going to be the new standard, I suggest that nobody in this body ever endorse anybody for President because apparently you can't serve in the That would be kind of silly.  I look at this as are you qualified for the job? Our friends on the other side look at it as if you don't agree with their liberal agenda, you can't do the job. Big difference. There has been an absolute wholesale attack on everything Trump when it comes to the nominations, with a few exceptions.  The basis of the attack is that they don't share the world view of our friends on the other side. That world view was litigated pretty thoroughly and you lost. What do you expect Donald Trump to do after his campaign? I expect him to do what he said he was going to do. Some of it I agree with, some of it I don't. Where I don't agree with him, I will challenge him.  The one challenge I will not make against this President is to deny him the ability to pick somebody who is clearly, in my view, qualified, even though I may have differences with him on particular issues.  I would say this about Senator I have known him for 20 years almost. I have traveled throughout the world with Senator Sessions and his family. Most of the time I agree with Jeff Sometimes I don't, but I found him to be an incredibly honorable man worthy of the job of being U.Senator from the great State of Alabama, reflecting the values of the people of That is what he got elected to do, by the way.  I think he will be uniquely qualified to be the Attorney General of the United States at a time of great challenge. He has been a U.attorney. He has been Attorney General of his He is a man steeped in the law. His biggest crime, I think, is that he is very conservative. That, to me, is not a disqualifier any more than being very liberal is a disqualifier.  How do you think we felt when Barack Obama basically turned ObamaCare upside down with one Executive order after another every time it started stinking up in public? He would unilaterally change the law to avoid a political consequence or granting millions of people legal status with a stroke of a pen, well beyond his lane, struck down by the Court as being outside his ability as President to do.  Not once did anybody on that side raise an objection. Eric Holder is a fine man. I can't remember a time when Eric Holder stood up to this runaway train in the Obama administration. Loretta Lynch is a fine woman. I can't remember one time she expressed doubt about President Obama's agenda. When it was left up to the courts to express[[Page S831]]doubt in this election, believe it or not, that had a lot to do with the way the last 8 years rolled out.  This was a check-and-balance election, and you are not going to be able to undo the consequences of this election unfairly. I think it would be unfair to say that Senator Jeff Sessions is not qualified for the job at hand.  Most of the attacks against Senator Sessions could be levied against almost everybody on this side of the aisle. The NAACP, according to Jeff Sessions, is one of the premier civil rights organizations in the history of the country. I think that is a fair characterization. Mr.Cornell Brooks, CEO of the NAACP, said of Senator Sessions: Senator Sessions' record throughout his career, whether in the Office of the U.Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, as attorney general of the State of Alabama or, most recently, as the junior U.Senator from Alabama evinces a clear disregard, disrespect, and even disdain for the civil and human rights of racial and ethnic minorities, women, the disabled, and others who suffer from discrimination in this country--a damning indictment.  Apparently, he doesn't stay in contact with the NAACP chapter in In 2009, the NAACP gave Jeff Sessions--Civic and Human Rights Convention, April 23 to 26, 2009, NAACP Governmental Award of Excellence, Senator Jeff Sessions: For the outstanding work you do.  That is one of the awards he forgot to tell us about, so I hope he will amend. Another attack on Senator Sessions, he received an award from a David Horowitz group that was labeled by the Senator from Connecticut as being some rightwing extremist organization. All I can say is that the Annie Taylor Award is named for a lady who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel. They give it to conservatives who stood up under difficult circumstances. I actually received the award as an impeachment manager. Chris Matthews was there to moderate the dinner. So I don't know what Mr.Horowitz said after I was there, before he was there; all I can say is that I received the award, too, and I sure as hell don't consider myself a bigot.  Voting against the Violence Against Women Act authored by Senator Leahy--I won't give you a long rendition. I voted against it, too, for reasons I will be glad to explain to you at a later time.  The bottom line here is that most of the things said about Jeff Sessions and the way he acted as a Senator could be said about almost all of us on this side who consider ourselves conservative.  Back to our friends at the NAACP, I asked Mr.Brooks, ``Do you have a legislative scorecard how you rate people in the Body?'' He said, ``And Senator Sessions has been historically low rated.''  Here is what I want the body to know: that in the report card of the 113th Congress, the first half, here are the ratings. Senator Grassley--all Republicans here, 11 percent; Hatch, 25 percent; Graham, 25 percent; Cornyn, 11 percent; Lee, 11 percent; Cruz, 11 percent; Sasse, he wasn't in Congress; Blake, 29 percent; Crapo, 14 percent; Tillis and Kennedy were not rated yet. On the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee, Feinstein, 100 percent; Leahy, 100 percent; Whitehouse, 100 percent; Klobuchar, 100 percent; Franken, 100 percent; Coons, 96 percent; Blumenthal, 100 percent; Hirono, 100 percent. Not only did Jeff Sessions have a poor rating, all of us did.  So to my friends on the other side, you are making arguments that I don't think are good for the future of this body and the country as a whole. You are basically saying: You did not vote for the legislation I supported. You voted against ideas I embrace that I think make America a unique place; therefore, you cannot have this job.  Here is what I would say: Senator Sessions voted as a very conservative Senator from the State of Alabama who has conducted himself honorably his entire life. And I really regret that we have gotten to this point. All of us in here know Jeff, and I have been on this floor fighting with him tooth and nail about immigration reform. I worked with Senator Durbin, who is going to speak next, and our chief antagonist most of the time was Senator Never in my darkest day will I ever believe Jeff Sessions said one word on this floor that he did not truly believe. And he reflects the views of millions of  As to the status of the LGBT community, I think Jeff Sessions was representing the values of his And all I can say is, that is what we are sent up here to do. If we disagree, we disagree, but it is a big leap from the policy disagreement to not qualified.  I asked the NAACP chairman: Name one Republican you would recommend to be Attorney  I have yet to get a name.  So what we are talking about here, unfortunately, is an attack on conservatism more than it is Jeff Sessions because almost everything said about Jeff could be said about me and most of my colleagues over here. Why did I vote for Holder? Why did I vote for Lynch? Why did I vote for Sotomayor and Hagel? And the list goes on and on and on.  I expect that when a liberal President wins, they will pick people who are qualified, who share their view to represent their administration. When it comes to the Attorney General, you can be liberal and you can be conservative, but you also still can be fair to the public as a whole.  I don't believe for 1 second that Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General of the United States, will take any of his political positions and jam them down your throat if the law says no. I have never seen that about the man.  The minority leader of the Alabama Senate, Senator Ross, an African-American Democratic minority leader, said:       I have worked with Jeff I know him personally,      and all of my encounters with him have been for the greater      good of We have spoken about everything, from civil      rights to race relations. We agree that as Christian men, our      hearts and minds focus on doing right by all people.  That is the Jeff Sessions I know. That is why I am lending my support to his nomination.  I have some serious differences with President Trump, and those differences will materialize over time. And I hope I have the courage of my convictions to stand up for what I believe even when my party has the White That is a very hard thing to do for all of us. I intend to do it to the best of my ability, and I will get a lot of coverage for doing that because that makes for good political reporting. But what will not be covered is the fact that on the really big issues, mostly, I agree with President Trump and Jeff Sessions about what we need to do to change the dynamic regarding crime. I will work with Senator Durbin to bring about sentencing reform, but it is now time to go in on the offense against crime.  One of the things that pleases me most about this nomination of Senator Sessions is that we have been very strong allies in fighting the War on Jeff Sessions understands the difference between fighting a crime and fighting a war. It will be welcome news for me to have an Attorney General who understands that Bin Laden's son-in-law who is captured on the battlefield should be treated differently than somebody who tried to steal your car. Under Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department will look at enemy combatants for who they are--warriors in a cause to destroy our lives--and they will be held consistent with the law of war, not domestic criminal law. And the days of terrorists being read the Miranda rights as if they were common criminals will soon be over. That will make us all safer.  I look forward to voting for Senator Sessions and working with him. And if we have disagreements, the one thing I know for sure is that Jeff will at least listen to me.  This body is adrift. The country is really divided. I hope that once this confirmation process is over, we can get back to doing the business of the American people.  To the extent that Donald Trump becomes the problem, we will push back. Right now, people are pushing back against everything all the time, and you are going to hurt yourself, as well as this body, because there is no way you can ever convince me that Jeff Sessions is not qualified to be the Attorney I can understand why you wouldn't pick him, but there is no doubt in my mind that he is somebody a Republican conservative President would pick, and they did.

Tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza  Mr.Mr.President, last week I was heartbroken to learn that a dear friend and great fighter for freedom, Vladimir Kara-Murza, had been hospitalized in Those of us who know the work of this brave Russian patriot could not afford to hope or assume that he was suffering some ordinary illness. Just 2 years ago, under mysterious circumstances, Vladimir grew very ill and fell into a coma.  Many suspected he was poisoned, to intimidate him or worse. That is why last week's news signaled another shadowy strike against a brilliant voice who has defied the tyranny of Putin's  Many Americans are not familiar with the life of Vladimir Kara-Murza, but it is one that reflects the best qualities of leadership, courage, selflessness, idealism and patriotism, and it is a life dedicated to the principles we all hold dear: truth and justice, freedom and fairness, human rights and human dignity.  All his life, Vladimir has been a brave, outspoken, and relentless champion for the Russian people. He is a deputy leader of the People's Freedom Party, Russia's leading pro-democracy party. He is a leading coordinator of Open Russia, a foundation that promotes civil society and democracy in In 2011, he helped mobilize the largest anti-Kremlin demonstration since the early 1990s, leading tens of thousands of Russians to march in protest of widespread fraud and corruption in the parliamentary elections.  In the United States, Vladimir was one of the most passionate and effective advocates for passage of the Magnitsky Act, legislation that gives the Federal Government powers to punish human rights violators in Most recently he has eloquently and persuasively campaigned to expand the Act to impose sanctions on those Russians journalists who were so cowed and corrupted by the Kremlin that they become indispensable to propagating the lies and atmosphere of hate, fear, and violence the Putin regime relies on to maintain power.  Vladimir's family has a long history of heroism for years, dating back to the early 1900s. Vladimir once described the experience of visiting the KGB archives in Moscow where he reviewed the thin file on his great grandfather who was executed. It contained the scant evidence required for a death sentence in Stalin's He recalled the weight that fell upon him when he read the modest document to which the executioners affixed the date and their signatures to signify that the judgment had been carried out.  Vladimir also learned what it takes to be a revolutionary from our mutual friend Boris Vladimir and Boris struggled together for years in the cause of freedom and democracy. Vladimir once called Boris the best President Russia never had.  Boris was one of the first to warn of the incoming Putin dictatorship, even when many of his fellow liberals could not see it. He told the truth about Putin's reign of terror, rampant corruption, and his illegal invasion of For the crime of telling the truth in Putin's Russia, Boris Nemtsov was murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin in 2015.  He died a martyr. He died a martyr for the rights of people who were taught to hate him but who will one day mourn his death, revere his memory, and despise his murderers. After Boris's assassination, many urged Vladimir not to return to He had every reason not to. He knew his own family's history with tyranny. He knew what happened to Boris Nemtsov, and he knew all too well about the culture of impunity that Putin has created in Russia, where individuals are routinely persecuted and attacked for their beliefs, including by the Russian Government, and no one is ever held responsible.  He knew about Sergei Yushenkov, who was investigating the Kremlin's potential role in the 1999 apartment bombings in Russia when he was shot and killed at the entrance of his apartment. He knew about American journalist Paul Klebnikov, who was investigating Russian Government connections to organized crime when he was shot to death in Moscow in 2004.  He knew about Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist, human rights activist, and fierce critic of Putin's brutal war in Chechnya, who was murdered in the stairwell of her apartment building on Putin's birthday in 2006.  He knew about former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who exposed the Putin regime's massive corruption tied to organized crime and involving assassination and murder. He was poisoned to death in 2006 with a radioactive isotype in a brazen act of nuclear terrorism.

7919,topic-id,1514,"Mr.President, first of all, I rise to speak in favor of the Senate confirming Senator Sessions to the position of Attorney General, chief law enforcement officer of our country, but I do want to say thank you to the Democratic minority of my committee because they did not boycott the meetings. They debated. They debated too long, from my point of view, but they debated, and we were able to do our work in a businesslike way. So I want to thank all of them for their participation.  Now I will take a few minutes to speak in strong support of my friend and our colleague Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as the 84th Attorney  Last week, the Judiciary Committee spent over 6 hours debating the nomination. Every single Democrat opposed the nomination, but this wasn't, of course, much of a surprise. During our committee debate, Senator Graham correctly pointed out that, based on the standard the Democrats established, it appears no Republican could ever earn their support.  It is no secret that our Democratic colleagues don't like the new They are doing what they can do to undermine the new administration.  With respect to Senator Sessions, my Democratic colleagues disagree with a number of policy positions he has taken over the years, but this year seems to be unlike previous administrations, where Senators supported Cabinet nominees even if they disagreed with the nominee on policy grounds. That is what happened in 2009, when Senator Sessions and I both supported Eric Holder for Attorney General, even though we disagreed with him on many policies.  So after listening to all the reasons they are opposing this nomination, I can boil their objections down to these points:  Even though many of my colleagues have known this good man for years, even though many of my colleagues have worked closely with him to pass important bipartisan legislation, even though many of them have praised him in the past for his integrity and for being a man of his word, even though Senator Sessions has pledged to support and defend all laws passed by Congress, even those he disagrees with, when it comes time to stand up in support of this good man, they are unwilling to take him at his word.  This is very troubling because all of us in the Senate know Jeff Some of us have known him for decades. Regardless of what my colleagues are willing to admit publicly, we all know him to be a man of deep integrity, a man of his word, and a man committed to fairness, to justice, and, most importantly, to the rule of law.  We all know that when Senator Sessions served as an assistant U.attorney, as a U.attorney, and as attorney general for his home State of Alabama, he worked hard to promote the rule of law and to bring justice to both victims and perpetrators. We know he has a deep commitment to the rule of law, something an Attorney General must possess or he could not be the chief law enforcement officer of the United In other words, that law or that position is all about carrying out and having a commitment to the rule of law. As I said, much of Senator Sessions' hearing focused on his record as a legislator.  Now, it is true Senator Sessions has voted on legislation in ways that the left doesn't like, and of course I have even disagreed with him from time to time, but we all understand that every time we cast a vote, we are voting the way we see as the best for our country. I think we all also understand that very rarely is any bill a so-called perfect piece of legislation.  At one time or another, every single Member of this body has opposed legislation based upon a principle objection to a particular provision.  So, of course, Senator Sessions has voted differently than his Democratic colleagues. Now, that is common sense. That is to be expected. This is the We are all about debating policy and for long periods of time. That is how the Senate works.  We all know the role of an Senator and the role of Attorney General are very, very different. A legislator debates policy and votes on legislation. The Attorney General enforces the laws, as enacted. All of us in the Senate understand that difference. Senator Sessions understands the difference better than most.  In addition to serving as a Senator for 20 years, he served in the Department of Justice for 15 years, a Department dedicated to law enforcement and to the rule of law and following what Congress directs law to be.  I am disappointed in my colleagues who have suggested Senator Sessions will not be able to put aside his policy differences that he established here in the United States and enforce the law, even if he voted against that law.  This is especially troubling after he specifically committed to us during this confirmation hearing that if he is confirmed, he will follow the law, regardless of whether he supported that statute as a policy matter.  The criteria for this nomination is, will this man, whose integrity is beyond reproach, enforce the law as he said he will?  Senator Sessions answered that question directly during his hearing. He stated this:       The Justice Department must remain ever faithful to the      Constitution's promise that our government is one of laws and      not of men. It will be my unyielding commitment to you, if      confirmed, to see that the laws are enforced faithfully,      effectively, and impartially.  He goes on to say:       The Attorney General must hold everyone, no matter how      powerful, accountable. No one is above the law, and no      American will be beneath its protection.  Now, whether he said those things one time or dozens of times--and it is more apt to be dozens of times during the day and a half of hearings that we had on him, plus the speeches that were given--it can't be much clearer than what he just said.  But even after he made this promise, Members asked Senator Sessions if he would defend the laws that he had voted against, and he answered in the affirmative, stating:       I would defend the statute if it is reasonably defensible.      It is passed by Congress, it would be the duty of the      Attorney General, whether they voted for it or support it, to      defend it.  He was questioned about a host of hot-button policy issues. Time and again, his answer was the same. He will enforce the law. This will actually be quite different from the Obama administration, which refused to enforce laws it didn't like. They did this while the people who are now in the minority--the Democrats--turned a blind eye when they didn't enforce the law.  Senator Sessions also made clear that he possesses the independence necessary for the Attorney I have often heard Senator Sessions ask Executive nominees, including nominees for Attorney General, whether they will have the fortitude to stand up to the President who appointed them. So I asked him the same question during my time of questioning in the committee. I asked if he will be able to say no to President Trump, and he said:       I understand the importance of your question, I understand      the responsibility of the Attorney General, and I will do so.      You simply have to help the President do things that he might      desire in a lawful way and have to be able to say, ``No,''      both for the country, for the legal system, and for the      President to avoid situations that are not acceptable. I      understand that duty. I have observed it through my years      here, and I will fulfill that responsibility.  Senator Sessions' commitment to be independent from the President when it is necessary and his promise to enforce the law is exactly what this Nation needs right now. We haven't seen much of this over the past 8 years.  The Department has been politicized over the past 8 years, and that has caused great harm. The leadership of the Department of Justice has undermined our confidence in the rule of law by picking and choosing which laws it will enforce. I am looking forward to turning a new page at the Department under our friend's leadership as Attorney It is desperately needed, particularly at this time.[[Page S826]]  Last weekend, in particular, it showed us how critical it is to have someone leading the Department who is committed to following the law. Last week, then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates announced that she wouldn't present arguments in defense of the President's recent Executive order, even though she admitted there was a defense to be made. As soon as she did this, Democrats ran to her defense and sang her praises, but after Senator Sessions' hearing, I would have expected Democrats to come to the opposite conclusion. During his hearing, they asked Senator Sessions whether he would enforce a law that he didn't like over and over and over.

This resolution does not cut a dime from family planning funding available to It simply enables States to direct the funding towards nonabortion ``whole women'' healthcare providers, such as rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers.  It is important to remember that, for every Planned Parenthood clinic, there are 20 federally qualified health centers. Each year, these centers serve over 21 million American women. This is almost eight times the impact of Planned Parenthood clinics.  We know that Federal law requires that federally qualified health centers provide mammograms, prenatal services, and emergency medical services, none of which are offered by Planned Parenthood clinics.  The States were wise to prioritize such quality health care for women with title X funds. Prior to this new, heavy-handed, agenda-driven policy, the States maintained the flexibility to determine grant recipients. This last-minute Obama administration rule effectively nullifies the policy of 13 States that want to prioritize women's health over abortion.  This Obama-era rule could also impair funding for another 10 States that have chosen comprehensive care over abortion-focused clinics like Planned But it gets worse. Of the 13 States impacted by this rule, five States--Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Ohio--could lose almost $16 million in title X funding for failing to abide by the rule. This regulation forces these States to forego their title X funding for all of the women in their  Today's resolution resolves this encroachment on the States, rolls back this last-minute rule, and restores flexibility to the States so that women can receive the health care they deserve.

In August of 2013, as the chairman and the ranking member mentioned, the southern portion of my district experienced a major disaster involving heavy flooding which devastated infrastructure, and it caused significant hardship for many of my constituents.  Unfortunately, the Federal recovery efforts to this devastated region added insult to injury. Local officials dealt with multiple uncoordinated teams conducting duplicative site visits due to lost paperwork, inconsistent messages between various survey and evaluation teams, and unnecessarily long[[Page H2449]]delays in recovery and reimbursement. Such a response to any disaster is unacceptable, and change is necessary.  As I work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have learned that these issues are not unique to central I have worked diligently with Chairman Barletta in crafting this bill to call attention to and to rectify FEMA's shortcomings.  This legislation is designed to address the deficiencies of the FEMA response to the 2013 flooding in my district to ensure future disaster recoveries in Missouri and elsewhere are as painless and efficient as possible.  Specifically, this bill requires FEMA to create an action plan to address inconsistent guidance, to establish appropriate recordkeeping procedures, and to improve overall assistance to local officials.  Additionally, this simple bill directs FEMA to issue a forward-looking report to identify new technologies that could further aid the disaster workforce in partnering with private nonprofits as well as State and local governments in the wake of a disaster or an emergency.  FEMA processes need to be streamlined and consistent in order to help those recovering from a disaster feel supported and assured relief will come in a timely, efficient manner.

Many of her remarks were criticizing a fellow colleague in the I don't know about the other side, but I find it offensive for either side to be criticizing, as was done here tonight, a sitting Member of the  I am absolutely astounded that the Democrats, my friends on the other side, have taken to the war tables a desire to defeat Jeff I have been here a long time, and I have to say that I knew Jeff Sessions even before he came here, and I have known him since he has been here. And, yes, I differ with him on a number of issues, but I would never say things about him as have been said by my colleagues on the other side. I think that we all ought to take some stock in what we are doing here.  Jeff Sessions is a very fine person. Think of his wife. She is a really fine person. Jeff has been here 20 years. He has interchanged with almost all of us. Sometimes you agree with him, and sometimes you disagree with him, but he has always been a gentleman. He has always been kind and considerate of his colleagues. I can't name one time when he wasn't. Yet we are treating him like he is some terrible person who doesn't deserve to be chosen by the current President of the United States to be Attorney General of the United  I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves--I really do--on both sides. And frankly, we have to get to where everything is not an issue here. I know some of my friends on the other side and I have chatted, and they are not happy with the way this body is going with good reason.  Everything doesn't have to lead to a gun fight on the floor, but that is where we are going. And frankly, sometimes there is an awful lot of politics being played here on both sides.  Look, I happen to like the senior Senator from I think she is an intelligent, lovely woman in many ways. But I have to tell you, I listened to her for quite a while, and she didn't have a good thing to say about a fellow Frankly, I don't think that is right. If we don't respect each other, we are going down a very steep path to oblivion.  I would hope that both sides would take stock of these debates. We can differ. We understand that the Democrats are not happy with the current We are happy with him. We can differ on that, and we can fight over various issues and so forth. But to attack a fellow Senator without reservation seems to me the wrong thing to do.  It may not have risen to the level of a violation of the rules, but I think it comes close, and I have sat here and listened to most of it and, frankly, I don't believe that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was right in any respect. I have been here a long time and I have seen some pretty rough talk, but never like we have had this first couple of months here. We have gone so far on both sides that we are almost dysfunctional.  I admit it was tough for the Democrats to lose the Presidential election. Most people thought that Hillary Clinton would win. I was not one of them. I thought there was a real chance because I knew a lot of people would not say for whom they were going to vote. I think, correctly, I interpreted that meant that they were going to vote for Donald Trump, and the reason they were is that they are tired of what is going on. They are tired of what is hurting this country. They are tired of the picayune little fights that we have around here.  I think we have to grow up. I suggest that all of us take stock of ourselves and see if we can treat each other with greater respect. I have to say, I resented--as much as I like the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, I resent the constant diatribe against a fellow Even if everything she said was true, it wasn't the right thing to do. I don't think any of us should do that to them, either. We can differ, we can argue, we can fight over certain words and so forth, but I have been appalled at the way the Democrats have treated Jeff I have found Jeff Sessions--having worked with him for 20 years and having disagreed with him on a number of things--to be a gentleman in every respect and to present his viewpoints in a reasonable and decent way.  I would hope that my colleagues on the other side would consider voting[[Page S859]]for Jeff Sessions or at least treating him with respect.  I admit that I think some of this comes from the fact that they are very upset at Donald Trump, and it is easy to see why. He won a very tough, contested election against one of their principal people. That is hard to take, maybe. That doesn't justify what has been going on against Jeff  We ought to be proud that Jeff has a chance to become the Attorney General of the United States, and he is going to be. That is the thing that really bothers me. Everybody on the other side knows that we have the votes to finally do this. Yet, they are treating it as though this is something that they have to try and win--which they are not going to win--and, in the process, treating a fellow Senator with disdain. It is wrong.  We should all take stock of ourselves. I am not accusing my colleagues of not being sincere, but they have been sincerely wrong. I am personally fed up with it. If we want to fight every day and just go after each other like people who just don't care about etiquette and courtesy, I guess we can do that, but I think it is the wrong thing to do.  I hope all of us will stop, take note of what has been going on, and on both sides start trying to work together. I know it was tough for my Democrat friends to lose the Presidential election. I know that was tough. And they didn't think they were going to, and, frankly, a lot of us didn't think they were going to. I did think that. But, then again, I was one of two Senators who supported Donald Trump, in my opinion, with very, very good reason. I am sure that doesn't convince any Democrats on the other side.  The fact is that we have to treat each other with respect or this place is going to devolve into nothing but a jungle, and that would truly be a very, very bad thing.  I am not perfect, so I don't mean to act like I am, but I have to say that all of us need to take stock. We need to start thinking about the people on the other side. We need to start thinking about how we might bring each other together in the best interests of our country and how we might literally elevate the Senate to the position that we all hope it will be.  I love all of my colleagues. There is not one person in this body that I don't care for a lot.

7927,topic-id,877,"Mr.President, I come to the floor with a labor of love before the U.We are talking about confirmations of people for Secretary positions on the Cabinet of the new We are talking about all kinds of things. We are in a budget period of time. We are talking about this year having two budgets--one we are going to use early and one we are going to use late.  The truth is, since 1980, we haven't passed all 12 appropriations bills in the year but twice. In other words, in the last 37 years, we have only twice done our job that we ought to do every year. So 2 years out of 37 we did it; 35 years we did not do it.  I am joining with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, a great Governor of that State and now a great Member of the U.Senate, to propound for the third Congress in a row an idea that is so simple and so great that it works and it works for all the American people. It is called a biennial budget process. What it does is it embraces a discipline for how you budget to bring about the right solutions in terms of what you do budget.  What the biennial budget process does is it says this. We would be far better off if we had more oversight of spending, more authorization projects, and more discipline in the way we spend money we are already spending before we start appropriating more.  Therefore, in every even-numbered year, we ought to do oversight of our spending, we ought to do accountability in our spending processes, we ought to do accountability in our spending process, and we ought to do no appropriations.  In our odd-numbered years, the nonelection years, is when you appropriate. Every other year you are spending, and then every other year you are doing accountability. What that causes is the cream to rise to the top. All of a sudden in 1 year, instead of departments coming to say we don't have time to oversight, we have to authorize more, they come to you and say: Here is how we spent our money, here are the savings we have found, and here is how we want to move forward in a more efficient way.  It is a little bit like my kitchen table and my family. All the way through my 49 years of marriage, my wife and I and our kids have sat around the kitchen table, decided what our family priorities are, from our vacations to our jobs, and then we budget our money for that year so we can pay our bills, enjoy the time we had together, and end up not being broke at the of the year.  What happens when you don't do that and you are a government is you end up owing $19 trillion and don't know how to pay for it. We cannot continue to spend at the escalated rate that we are spending without more accountability on the process so I think the biennial process is the right way to go.  There is some documentation for that. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire was a Governor of her State who had a biennial budget, but 19 of the 50 States have biennial budgets already. They work, and they work fine. They give them the luxury of doing what we don't do in Washington, they give them the luxury of having the time to study their appropriations, find savings in existing taxation before they start raising anybody's taxes or appropriating anymore.  It is a simple, disciplined way to go about the business of spending the people's money in the same way they make their determination.  I ran a pretty large company for 19 years and was in business for 35 years before I came to I know that running a business is hard, but it is not hard because it is complex; it is hard because it is tough. Prioritizing your appropriations is tough business.[[Page S842]]Somebody has to do it, and the people who are elected to the Congress of the United States are elected to do that job.  I am proud to join Senator Shaheen on the floor today and urge all Members to vote for a biennial budget process in the Congress of the United I remind everyone in the room that we had this vote a few years ago as a test vote on an all-night vote-arama on the budget, and we got 72 votes, if I remember correctly, in favor of the biennial budget.

For many people, particularly women, title X funding literally means the difference between receiving reproductive health care or being forced to go without birth control, critical cancer screenings, and other preventive care.  For the 4 in 10 women who access health care at title X-funded providers, cutting this funding would mean cutting their access to health care altogether. For people of color, rural communities, and those who struggle to make ends meet, cutting title X funds will certainly have a disproportionate impact.  Let's be very clear that these funds are not controversial, but the Republican majority in Congress and anti-choice groups are doing their best to create a false narrative in order to demonize this funding, which has done nothing but improve the lives of millions of people.

7947,topic-id,1813,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleagues and make remarks on Senator Sessions' nomination to serve as Attorney I will be coming back later this evening to focus on voting rights and some of the other issues at hand--freedom of the press, antitrust. I am actually the ranking member on that subcommittee, and while Senator Sessions has assured me that if confirmed, he will keep the independence of that part of the Justice Department away from outside influence from the White House, I am very focused on that because I think we have seen a wave of mergers, and I want to address that more in depth later.  I worked successfully with Senator Sessions on a number of UC's over the years such as adoption and human trafficking. We have worked together well, and if he is confirmed, I am sure we will find some areas of common agreement. I am not supporting him, however, and I have told him this in person and I have talked about it at the Judiciary Committee because of my concerns relating to some of his views on some of the core functions of the Justice Department, and that is enforcing voting rights, the handling of immigration issues, the freedom of the press, and the Violence Against Women  Now, he has assured me that he will keep the Office on Violence Against Women funded--which I appreciate--in the Justice Department, but I was very concerned that he had actually voted against the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization recently. It was something that the majority of Republican Senators voted for and every single woman Senator, Democrat or Republican, voted in favor of.  As a prosecutor and a U.Senator, one of my main criminal justice priorities has been enforcing and reauthorizing VAWA or the Violence Against Women It is a bill that took roots in my State, thanks to the efforts on the initial bill of former Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Both of them tragically died in a plane crash, and we miss them very much. But Paul and Sheila's legacy lives on in the work of the Violence Against Women  It has a long history, as the President knows, of bipartisan support. Since it was first passed in 1994, we have made great strides in raising awareness that these are serious crimes, not shameful secrets. Since the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, annual domestic violence rates have fallen by 50 percent, but the statistics make clear that domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault are still a major problem in According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for every minute, 20 people in the United States are victims of physical violence by an intimate partner. That is about 10 million people every year.  Millions more individuals are the victims of stalking crimes each year, with approximately 15 percent of women at some point during their lifetime experiencing stalking, during which they feel very fearful or believe that they or someone close to them could be harmed or killed.  I would like to note briefly that I am pleased that the Senate recently passed the resolution that Senator Perdue and I introduced on stalking to raise awareness. I have been confronted by these issues of domestic violence and stalking since before I became a In fact, that is when I was Hennepin County attorney. That is the largest prosecutor's office in our I managed an office of about 400 people. With that big office handling everything from representing our State's biggest public hospital to violent murder cases, the poster that you saw when you walked into our office and down the hallway so that everyone could see it was a picture of a woman who was beaten up. She had a Band-Aid over her nose, and she was holding a little baby boy. The words read: Beat your wife, and it is your son that goes to jail. Why? That poster reminds everyone that domestic violence and sexual assault just don't hurt the immediate victims. They hurt children, families, and entire communities. We know that kids who see violence happen are twice as likely to commit it themselves and to continue the cycle. That is why I worked with Senator Leahy along with Senator Crapo to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized.  What does this legislation do? The legislation ensures that law enforcement has the tools to prosecute domestic and sexual violence and ensures that victims have the support they need to get back on their feet. But we also made some important updates on the law, including addressing the problem of above average levels of domestic violence in tribal areas, by allowing tribal courts to prosecute and to handle cases with people who are tribal members and in very specific cases when violence is committed on the reservation.  Providing a uniform nondiscrimination provision was also included to ensure services are available to everyone who needs them, including victims in same-sex relationships. The new bill included stronger housing protections for victims and increased accountability for grant recipients. It also strengthened and updated anti-stalking laws to better address the new technologies that predators are using to harass their victims. This was a bipartisan provision that I authored with Republican former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of  As I said, all 20 women Senators supported this critical legislation, and it passed with bipartisan support on a vote of 78 to 22, with support from a majority of Senators in Senator Sessions' own party, not to mention men and women across the country.  The reason Senator Sessions had for not voting for the bill was that it was the tribal provisions that he didn't like because of the dual jurisdiction. That just doesn't hold up for me, given what I have seen in my  Now, what does this really mean to people? Let me end this portion of my remarks with two stories. The first is about a case that our office handled, and a prosecutor in our office who was very well thought of handled it in our office, involving two immigrants. This was a case where this man was from Russia, and he beat up his wife repeatedly over the years. They had a little daughter. One day he killed his wife, and then he went to Home Depot and he bought a saw. And then he basically dismembered her and put her in a garbage bag and brought her to another State and dumped her in a river. He left the head in his trunk, and he brought it back to the Twin He eventually confessed to his crime.  The family gathered--and they were a very small family. The mom and dad came from Russia, and then there was the little girl who had been left behind with really no parent to take care of[[Page S848]]her anymore. I went to meet with the family before the funeral with our prosecutor and our victim witness advocate. I heard the story then that at the airport--the little girl had never met her deceased mother's twin sister. They were identical twins. And as they got off the airplane and her grandparents and that aunt got off the airplane, the little girl ran up to that aunt and grabbed her and said ``Mommy, Mommy'' because she thought that it was her mother and that her mother was still alive.  Those are the victims of domestic violence. It is not just the immediate victim; it is everyone around them.  Or, the case in Lake City, MN, of Officer Shawn Schneider, an incredibly brave police officer who was called one day to a domestic violence case. It was a man who was clearly affected by mental illness, who was threatening his 17-year-old girlfriend, and the cop went up to the door, and there he was. He had his bullet proof vest on, but the man shot the police officer in the head, and he died. I attended that funeral.  When I was there, I saw their young family, the two young little boys and this little girl. I heard the story about the last time they were in their church for the nativity play, and the dad was sitting there--the police officer--in the pew, watching his family and his children perform. The next time they were in the church was when that little girl with the blue dress covered in stars was walking down the aisle for her dad's funeral.  That is domestic violence. It does concern me that we did not get support from the nominee. I do appreciate that he said he would continue to fund the Office on Violence Against Women, and I believe that that is very important to the functioning of the Justice  Since its inception in 1995, the Office on Violence Against Women has provided financial and technical assistance to communities nationwide--very important to the Department of  The last thing I want to mention--and I will come back again to some of these other priorities that I think are important, if Senator Sessions is confirmed, to continue to be a focus in the Justice Department, as well as other concerns that I have--is the funding of the COPS program. Republican Senator Murkowski and I are leading that effort. We have always had, especially in the House of Representatives, bipartisan support for the COPS program.  During Senator Sessions' hearing, I made a special note to discuss that issue with Chuck Canterbury, who is the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, and we had a good discussion about that. He stated that he shared my view that this is a very important program, particularly with the sharp decrease in staffing levels we have seen for law enforcement around the country in recent years, including training funding--something that is really important.  The Community Oriented Policing Services, or the COPS program, was established many years ago. It helped to place more than 129,000 police officers on the beat in more than 13,000 State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. In fiscal year 2015, the COPS office was able to award grants to just 209 of the over 1,000 law enforcement agencies that applied. It translated into about 915 officers, which is still a lot, but, in fact, there were requests for over 3,000 officers.  I think we can all agree, and hope the administration agrees, that this is a very important program. I will continue to work with Senator Sessions, if he is confirmed, to make sure we have the support from the administration for this program, which, again, is one of the top priorities of the Fraternal Order of Police and other police organizations across the country.  I look forward to discussing other issues when I return, but for now, I yield the floor. Thank you.

7997,topic-id,3854,"Madam President, I first want to say a few words about the Senator from Massachusetts and her passion and what she has brought to this While I know she has not been allowed to complete her remarks today, I know that will not silence her, and we look forward to hearing from her tomorrow and many days in the future on so many topics.  I also wanted to say something about my friend from We have worked together on so many bills. I have seen firsthand that he means what he says about treating this Chamber with the dignity that we all deserve and that the American people deserve.  Also, I was especially impressed by the words from the Senator from When I see the majority leader and the Democratic leader over there talking in the corner now, I think that is a good sign, because I have never seen a time where the Senate is more important, as the Senator from Florida was mentioning.  This is a moment in time where the Senate will not just be a check and balance, but it is also a place for compromise. The one issue where I would differ slightly with my friend and colleague from Utah is that this isn't just about Democrats responding with surprise or anger to the election of a new There have been a lot of things said in the last few months, including calling judges ``so-called judges'' and some of the discussions and comparisons to foreign leaders, and things that we have heard from the White House in the last few weeks, including the order that was issued that some of our Republican colleagues expressed a lot of concern about and that the Senate wasn't involved in and that a lot of law enforcement people weren't involved in.  There have been reasons that people's passions are high, and there are reasons that are good ones because we care about this country. So I hope people will see that in perspective for why people are reacting the way they do.  As for the Senator from Alabama, as I would call him for the purpose of these remarks, I am someone who has worked well with him. We have done bills together on adoption, and we have worked together on trafficking, and I am proud of the work I have done with him. We have also gone to the State of the Union together every single year, and I value his friendship.  I came to the conclusion that I couldn't support him not for personal reasons, but because of some of the views he has expressed in the past and his record on the Violence Against Women Act, his views on immigration, and his views relating to voting rights.  I think many of our colleagues, especially those who serve on the Judiciary Committee, feel the same way--that this wasn't personal, but we simply had a deep disagreement with some of his views on certain issues.  Today I thought I would focus on the voting rights issue. I spoke earlier about the Violence Against Women Act, and I think that is a good place to start as we work together going forward. We have seen an attack on America's election system; we have had 17 intelligence agencies talking about the fact that a foreign country tried to influence our election. It is the core of our democracy. I know the Senator from Florida himself has said that this time it happened to one candidate, one party, and the next time it could be another party, another candidate. So this idea of voting--this idea of the freedom to vote--is the core of our democracy.  One of the most important duties of the Justice Department--and that is the office for which the Attorney General would run--is safeguarding voters' access to the ballot box. This issue is important in my We had the highest voter turnout of any State in the country in this past election, and part of the reason we had such a good turnout is that we have good laws that allow for people to vote. It allows for same-day registration. We make it easy for people to vote; we don't make it hard. For me, that is one of the major duties of the Justice Department, and that is to enforce our voting rights.  I will never forget when I traveled to Alabama in the last few years with one of the leaders, Congressman John Lewis, who was one of the 13 original Freedom In 1964 he coordinated the efforts for the Mississippi Freedom Summit, recruiting college students from around the country to join the movement, to register African-American voters across the People from my State went, and people from every State in this Chamber went there for that  On March 7, 1965, Congressman Lewis and 600 other peaceful protestors attempted to march from Selma to Birmingham to protest violence against civil rights workers. As they reached the crest of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they saw a line of troopers blocking their way. At the end of the bridge, those peaceful marchers were attacked, just for calling for the right to vote. John Lewis's skull was fractured, and he still bears that scar to this day.  The weekend that I went back there, 48 years after that bloody Sunday, was the weekend that the police chief of Montgomery actually handed Congressman Lewis a badge and publicly apologized for what happened to him that day, 48 years later. But as moving as that apology was, we still have a duty to make sure that those sacrifices were not in vain. We also need to make it easier for people to actually vote, and that is a promise still unmet in America over 50 years later, whether it is lines at voting booths or whether it is laws in place that make it harder to vote.  I just look at this differently, having come from a high voter turnout State, a State where we have same-day registration, and when we look at the other high voter States that have that same-day registration station--Iowa, the Presiding Officer's State is one of them; that is not really a Democratic State, yet they have a high voter turnout and people participate and feel a part of that process. New Hampshire, Vermont, these States are truly split, but what we want to see is that kind of participation.[[Page S860]]  A couple of months after I was in Selma, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in the case of Shelby County v. In this decision, the Justices found that a formula in section 4 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. This formula was used to decide which States and localities needed to have Federal approval for any changes made to their voting rights laws, endangering the progress made over the past 50 years.  According to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice, following the Shelby County decision, 14 States put new voting restrictions in place that impacted the 2016 Presidential election. Three other States also passed restrictive voting measures, but those laws were blocked by the courts. So the harm is very real and very serious, and we can't sit by and just let this happen.  Specifically, we need a Department of Justice that will vigorously enforce the remaining sections of the Voting Rights Act as well as the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Currently, a majority of the States are not complying with the National Voter Registration Act, leaving voting rolls outdated and preventing eligible voters from casting their ballots. Without a Department of Justice that makes the enforcement of these laws a priority, the rights of voters will continue to be infringed.  Congress also needs to take action through legislation to make right what came out of that Supreme Court decision. Effectively throwing out the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act just doesn't make sense. As Justice Ginsberg put so well in her dissent, ``Ending preclearance now is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''  Those marchers in Selma sacrificed too much for us not to fight back. That is why I cosponsored legislation last Congress that would amend the Voting Rights  I am under no illusion that amending the Voting Rights Act in Congress will be easy. It won't be. We have seen some bipartisan support. In fact, Congressman Sensenbrenner, from my neighboring State of Wisconsin, who sponsored the reauthorization in 2006, called for Congress to restore the Voting Rights As he put it, ``the Voting Rights Act is vital to America's commitment to never again permit racial prejudices in the electoral process.''  Another issue I want to focus on this evening that I raised in Senator Sessions' hearing is the fundamental importance of freedom of the press. My dad was a newspaper reporter, and up until a few years ago, he was still writing a blog. So I am especially sensitive to, and concerned about, maintaining the press's role as a watchdog.  On a larger note, the role of journalists is critical to our Nation's democracy. That is why our Founders enshrined freedom of the press in the First When we look at what we are seeing in the last few years in our country, what concerns me is this assault on democracy. We have voting rights issues with people unable to vote, with lines, with restrictive voting laws passed as opposed to finding ways to allow more people to vote. We have outside money in politics. Recently, we have some of the things being said about judges, and now we have some assault on this notion of the freedom of the press.  Thomas Jefferson said that our first objective should be to leave open ``all avenues to truth,'' and the most effective way of doing that is through ``the freedom of press.'' This is still true today. Freedom of the press is the best avenue to truth. In fact, these values are more important now than ever, at a time when people are not exactly valuing the freedom of the press.  I believe there are two distinct roles journalists will hold that Congress must preserve and strengthen in the coming years. The first is providing the people with information about their government. Sometimes this is as simple as covering the passage of a new law in a public forum. This work doesn't just lead to a better, informed public. It can also lead to important actions.  Thanks to excellent reporting from across the country, Americans have been energized in the past. For instance, just a few weeks ago there was an attempt to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics over in the That came out, people were outraged, it was reported on, and they backed down.  The second role we must preserve is journalists' responsibility to be fact-checkers. They research, they provide context, and, when they need to, they correct. We need newspapers and media to stand up for what is true and what is factual. Unlike what was recently said--not in this Chamber--the press cannot simply keep its mouth shut. The American people deserve the truth, and we are all relying on journalists to keep digging for it. I take this personally and seriously.  In Senator Sessions' hearing I asked him whether he would follow the standards now in place at the Justice Department, which address when Federal prosecutors can subpoena journalists or their records and serve to protect reporters engaged in news-gathering activities. The previous two Attorneys General both pledged not to put reporters in jail if they were simply doing their job under the law.  The Senator from Alabama did not make that commitment. When I asked him about this in his hearing, he said he had not yet studied those rules. He also did not make a commitment when I later asked him to do that on the record.  The Senator from Alabama has also raised concerns in the past about protecting journalists from revealing their sources, including opposing the Free Flow of Information Act when it was considered by the Judiciary Committee in 2007, 2009, and 2013. So at this time, when our freedom of the press has been under attack at the highest levels of government, I believe it is critically important that our Justice Department continues to function as an independent voice that will protect the ability of journalists to do their job.  Lastly, I want to take a moment to focus on the importance of the Antitrust Division at the Department of As ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I am concerned about the state of competition in the marketplace. I wish to take a few minutes on this issue.  I did ask Senator Sessions about this at his hearing, and he said he was committed to an independent division in the Justice Department and to continue that work without outside influence. I continue to believe that this issue will be important because of the massive amount of mergers we are seeing. The legal technicalities behind our antitrust laws will not be familiar to most Americans, but effective antitrust enforcement provides benefits we can all understand. When companies vigorously compete, they can offer consumers the lowest prices and the highest quality goods and services.  Senator Sessions has stated that he will support the independence of that division, and I want to make clear how critical this is. It is absolutely essential that our next Attorney General enforces our antitrust laws fairly and vigorously, and that this person protects the integrity of the Antitrust Division's prosecutorial function from inappropriate influence. This is because vigilant antitrust enforcement means more money in the pockets of American consumers. The Attorney General can do this by identifying and preventing competition problems before they occur, like stopping a merger that would allow a few dominant players to raise prices, or, when a merger is allowed to move forward, putting conditions in place to protect competition.  The next Attorney General will also be able to stop price-fixing cartels that hurt consumers by artificially inflating prices for goods such as auto parts, TVs, and tablet computers. Last year alone, the Justice Department obtained more than $1 billion in criminal antitrust fines. Anticompetitive practices have serious impacts on consumers; for example, pay-for-delay settlements that keep cheaper generic drugs from coming onto the markets. Estimates suggest that eliminating those sweetheart deals would generate over $2.9 billion in budget savings over 10 years and save American consumers billions on their prescription drug costs. That is why Senator Grassley and I worked on bipartisan legislation to give the Federal Trade Commission greater ability to block those anticompetitive agreements. Our Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act would increase consumers' access to cost-saving generic drugs.[[Page S861]]  The bottom line is this. Antitrust enforcement is needed now more than ever. We are experiencing a wave of concentration across industries. Just last year, then-Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Division Bill Baer, a lifelong antitrust practitioner, said his agency was reviewing deals with such antitrust concerns that they should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom.  Not only will antitrust violations mean higher prices for Americans and less innovation, but the indirect effects are equally troubling. There is concern that undue concentration of economic power would exacerbate income inequality. There is also concern that concentration can hurt new businesses, stifling innovation. Why would you innovate if there is just one or two firms? Only effective antitrust enforcement by the Attorney General will prevent those harms, and effective enforcement can occur only if the Department of Justice makes enforcement decisions based on the merits of the individual case, rather than politics.  Traditionally, the White House has not interfered with antitrust enforcement decisions, but recent reports indicate that the President has discussed pending mergers with CEOs during ongoing antitrust reviews. Some companies have also publicly reported their conversations with and their commitments to the In both Senator Sessions' hearing and in a follow up letter, I raised this issue with him. The Senator from Alabama said: ``It would be improper to consider any political, personal, or other non-legal basis in reaching an enforcement decision.''  That is the correct answer. I plan to rigorously protect the Antitrust Division's prosecutorial integrity to make sure it is principled and is done right. Antitrust and competition policy are not Republican or Democratic issues. A merger in the ag industry could have an effect on farmers in Iowa, as the Presiding Officer knows. These are consumer issues, and these issues could not be more important to all We can all agree that robust competition is essential to our free-market economy and critical to ensuring that consumers pay the best prices for what they need.  I want to switch gears and conclude today by speaking about the President's Executive order regarding refugees, especially those from Muslim countries, which has caused so much chaos across our country over the past several weeks.  While I know Senator Sessions was not involved in writing the Executive order, it is very important that going forward, obviously, the Attorney General and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel have a responsibility to review Presidential Executive orders and assure they are legal and done right.  I sent a letter, with Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Franken, Coons, and Blumenthal, and we asked Senator Sessions what he would have done if the President's Executive order came across his desk. As a former prosecutor, I have long advocated for thorough vetting and supported strong national security measures.  I believe that the 1 priority should be making people safe. While working to strengthen biometrics and other security measures is a good goal, this is not the way our government should work--that an order should be put out there without properly vetting it and figuring out the effect it would have on a four-year-old girl who is in a refugee camp in That happened.  In my State, there was a mom who had two children, a Somali mother in a refugee camp. She got permission to come over to our State and to our country as a refugee. But she was pregnant, and when she had that baby, that baby did not have permission to come with her. So she had a Sophie's choice: Does she leave the baby in the refugee camp with friends and go to America with her two other daughters, or do all of them stay in the refugee camp in Uganda? She made a decision that she would go with her two older girls, that that would be the safest thing for them.  For 4 years, she worked to get the child that was left behind in the refugee camp to America to be reunited with her sisters. The baby, who is now 4 years old, was to get on a plane on the Monday after the President's Executive order was issued. The 4-year-old could not get on that plane.  Senator Franken and I got involved. We talked to General He was more than generous with his time. They made an exception, and the 4-year-old is now in But it should not take a Senator's intervention--as many of my colleagues know that have worked on these cases--to get a 4-year-old who is supposed to be reunited with their family, something that our government had worked on for 4 years and Lutheran Social Services in Minnesota had worked on for 4 years.  If Senator Sessions is in fact confirmed as the next Attorney General, these are actual issues he is going to have to work on, and beyond that, we have the issue of how people in our country are afraid.  We have 100,000 Somalis in We have the biggest Somali population in the country. A man who works for me started with my office 10 years ago and has been our outreach to the Somali community. He was just elected to the school board.  We have Somalis elected to our city council. They are part of the fabric of life in our Congressman Emmer, who actually took the seat held by Michele Bachmann, is the cochair, along with Congressman Ellison, of the Somali caucus in the House of We have not seen this as a Democratic issue or a Republican issue in our We have welcomed these refugees.  We have the second biggest population of Hmong in the United States of We have the biggest Liberian population. We have one of the biggest populations of people from We have 17 Fortune 500 companies in our When these refugees come over, they are legal workers, and they are a major part of our economy. So it is no surprise that during the last year, when we heard the kind of rhetoric that we have heard, people have been concerned--not just the refugees themselves, not just their friends and family, but a lot of people in our The churches have gotten involved--all kinds and every denomination in our State--to stand up for our Muslim population. Why? Because they have all heard the story. One of my most memorable stories was from a family whom I heard about when I was visiting with some of our Muslim population in This was a story of two adults who actually had been in our State during 9/11. And during 9/11, George Bush stood up and he said: This isn't about a religion. This is about evil people who did evil things, but it is not to indict a religion.  His U.attorney at the time, the Republican U.attorney, went around with me--the elected prosecutor for the biggest county in our State--and we met with the Muslim population and assured them they were safe and told them to report hate crimes. The family, these two adults, they were there then. Nothing bad happened to them. No one called them a name.  Fast-forward to this summer. They are at a restaurant with their two little children. They are just sitting there having dinner.  A guy walks by and says: You four go home. You go home to where you came from.  The little girl looked up at her mom, and she said: Mom, I don't want to go home and eat tonight. You said we could eat out tonight.  The words of an innocent child. She didn't even know what that man was talking about because she only knows one home. That home is our State, and that home is the United States of  If Senator Sessions is confirmed for this position, he is going to have an obligation to that little girl who was in that restaurant and to all of the people in our country because this is the Justice Department of the United States of  As a former prosecutor, I know a big part of that job is prosecuting cases and doing all we can to keep America safe from evildoers, but it is also about keeping our Constitution and our rights safe.

Under the Affordable Care Act, 1 million people in Illinois gained health insurance. Under this plan, over 1 million would lose it. Millions more across our country currently receiving coverage through their jobs would lose their health care as well.  State and local budgets would face cuts in Federal aid, forcing a choice between cutting coverage and raising taxes. My home State of Illinois alone would lose $40 billion over the next decade.  And this bill would wreak havoc on the American economy.

7799,topic-id,330,"Mr.Speaker, as the House considers this legislation, I stand in support of expanding Internet access around the globe. In this fast growing and ever changing world, the gap between those who have and have not will be made even more dramatic for those without internet access. Internet access is a valuable commodity that helps millions of lives, and everyone should have access to it.  In the 21st century, one thing is crystal clear: Access to the internet is critical. 4.2 billion people worldwide don't have access to the internet. This includes children starting school, young women starting businesses, and communities looking for ways to compete in the global market.  Women are particularly impacted and left behind, something that shouldn't go unnoticed by this body. UNICEF reports that nearly 90% of the income women bring in is reinvested into their family, more than double what men reinvest. Women build up their communities, and we must do whatever we can to ensure they have the resources necessary to succeed.  Not only will this bill reach those women who live in the dark without web services, it will promote the rights and values that make America exceptional. The freedoms of expression and assembly are fundamental rights, and the Internet can be a critical medium for promoting democracy. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute put it best when it said ``The Internet has fundamentally empowered the consumer [. . .] It saves the consumer time and gives customers access to products.'' In this great body, I hope we continue to stand for democracy, its values, and support those who wish to stand up for their rights.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr.Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.600.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

Most recently, two families from war-torn Syria were placed in  Vermonters understand the meaning of community, of supporting one another through tough times and celebrating together in seasons of joy. Over the last three decades, the meaning of community has expanded to include numerous nationalities as Vermonters have welcomed new neighbors from countries including Somalia, Sudan, and Bhutan, among others. Over the last 25 years, Vermont's growing diversity has infused vitality and a diversity of culture into our rural State as locals open their arms--and their hearts--to new cultures and ways of life. New Vermonters hail from the world over[[Page S965]]and are greeted in the Green Mountains by support groups and refugee associations. Some organizations aid new arrivals by offering workforce developments and translation services, while others host furniture and clothing drives. Many refugees are able to find jobs in Vermont's bustling tourism industry, as they work to save for future endeavors.  These support networks expand as the same individuals who once relied on refugee organizations begin to offer guidance to others. For some, this means years of saving before opening restaurants or stores with food and products that feature their home countries. Others focus on engaging recently arrived refugees in the very communities that they were welcomed into. As their roots grow deeper and their communities wider, Vermont's cultural vibrancy increases.  At the end of the day, however, these refugees have become part of the fabric of our communities. Vermont has become a home, if not their first home. In an article featured in POLITICO in November 2016, one refugee, Ramadan Bahic, a Bosnian Muslim who fled their Serb-controlled town during the Bosnian civil war said, ``My language is my language, my accent will stay, but if you ask me, I'm a Vermonter.''  To Mr.Bahic and to those refugees recently settled in Vermont--or hope to do so in the future--I say welcome home.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a November 2016 POLITICO article, ``My Language is My language, But I'm a Vermonter,'' be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From POLITICO, 17, 2016]           `My Language Is My Language, But I'm a Vermonter'       Vermont has accepted thousands of refugees over the years,      boosting the population and the economy. A debate over      accepting Syrians put the state to the test.                           (By Erick Trickey)       Burlington--Eight years ago, Som Timsina's family left a      refugee camp in Nepal and became one of the first Bhutanese      families to seek sanctuary in Timsina drove the      Holiday Inn's shuttle on night shifts for three years as he      saved to open his own Asian grocery. Five years later,      Central Market has become a gathering place for the state's      growing population of ethnic Nepali from Bhutan, and its      kitchen dishes out Himalayan cuisine that gets raves from      locals on Yelp--tikka masala and biryani, plus Nepali momo      dumplings.       Timsina, 38, works long, fast-paced days. In a 20 minute      chat in his store, he never takes off his black jacket or      takes the Bluetooth from his ear. Though business isn't as      strong as he'd like, and housing costs in Burlington are      high, Vermonters, he says, have offered a welcoming refuge      for him and his family--including his father, who was      tortured by authorities in       ``They react good so far,'' he says of ``They      are helping us.''       For decades now, Vermont has welcomed refugees from around      the world: more than 8,000 since 1989, just over 1 percent of      the small state's population. Vermonters have been almost      Canadian in their big-hearted welcome of the displaced and      persecuted, primarily from Somalia, Sudan, Central Africa,      Bhutan and They're generous donors of furniture and      household goods for new arrivals. They've taken Somali      refugees into their homes to help them adjust to American      life. And their schools have stepped up with English-language      classes for kids from abroad. In Vermont, refugee      resettlement has enjoyed near-unanimous support from state      and local political leaders, who see it as a way to add youth      and vigor to the largely rural state's declining population.      And for the most part their constituents have agreed. Until      this year.       On April 26--the same day Donald Trump swept through seven      Republican primaries in the northeast--the mayor of Rutland,      southern Vermont's largest town, announced a plan to accept      up to 100 war refugees a year, beginning with Syrian      families. The reaction was swift. A volunteer group, Rutland      Welcomes, organized to prepare for the Syrians' arrival, and      at the same time a vocal group bent on halting the      resettlement, Rutland First, flooded meetings in the town of      16,000. The ensuing debate, which dragged on through the      summer, was a miniature version of the emotionally charged      argument that dominated so much of the presidential cycle.      But the way Rutland residents responded was quintessentially      Vermont: generous and pragmatic. In the end, most residents      saw that this was about more than the refugees' well-being.      It was about their own as well.       A six-foot-tall teddy bear with a red bowtie rests on a      shelf in Vermont Bosna Cutting, Ramadan Bahic's fabric shop.      It's a photo op for every kid who visits the business, and a      symbol of how Bahic and his wife rebuilt their lives in the      Green Mountain State after fleeing Bosnia in 1993. Fashion      designers before the war, the Bahics now cut fabric for      clients that include the Vermont Teddy Bear       ``I can say I'm born here,'' says Bahic, 56, burly and      upbeat. ``My language is my language, my accent will stay,      but if you ask me, I'm a Vermonter.''       Bahic and his family, all of them Bosnian Muslims, fled      their Serb-controlled town during the Bosnian civil war. ``My      father was beaten by Serbs,'' Bahic says. ``Both my parents,      they were almost killed. We were witnesses, so we were      supposed to be killed.'' The Red Cross evacuated them to a      refugee camp in Croatia, and after four months, they were      resettled in       Though Vermont isn't known for its diversity--whites make      up 94 percent of its population of 625,000--that's changing.      Bahic's new life is a testament to the major role refugees      have played in bringing new cultures to His      parents' funeral services were presided over by an imam from      the Islamic Center of Vermont, one of the state's two      mosques. Though Bahic leads a mostly secular life--he likes      to gamble and drink--he's visited Burlington-area churches to      explain The 15 employees at his business in suburban      Winooski include many Vietnamese-immigrant seamstresses. His      Bhutanese neighbors in his Colchester apartment complex are      working hard, hunting for new work, moving up. ``In five      years, they're looking to buy a house, some looking to buy a      new car,'' he says.       Immigrants in Vermont have organized to help newer      arrivals. The Association of Africans Living in Vermont,      founded as a social circle, now offers workforce development      and translation services to new refugees. Tuipate Mubiay, a      Congolese immigrant who co-founded the group in 1999, also      runs an orientation and a conversation partners program for      refugee students at the Community College of       ``I feel Vermont has more open doors than other states,''      says Immigrants in the state tend to find jobs,      apartments and health insurance faster than elsewhere, he      says.       At the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program in Colchester,      the state's only refugee placement agency, flyers on a lobby      bulletin board offer refugees tips on jobs, health care and      transportation: ``UPS is now hiring,'' ``Vermont Health      Connect,'' ``Get a bike--Bike Recycle Vermont,'' ``And      Remember, Please Give 15 Days Notice If You Are Quitting A      Job.'' The Children's Book of America, edited by William      Bennett, the Reagan administration secretary of education,      rests on a coffee table, its cover illustration a bunch of      kids from a kaleidoscope of ethnicities waving American      flags.       Amila Merdzanovic, VRRP's director, came to Vermont in 1995      as a Bosnian refugee. She makes the case for resettlement's      contributions to Vermont: It brings about 200 working adults      a year to a state with a stagnant, aging population. ``We      have employers calling us on a daily basis, saying, `We need      workers,' she says. Many refugees get jobs at hotels and      restaurants. Landlords call, too, despite Burlington's low      housing vacancy rate. ``Refugees are hyper-aware of the      importance of good credit,'' she says. ``[They] take care of      their apartments and their neighborhoods.''       It's hard to measure refugees' assimilation or happiness.      Instead, agencies like VRRP look at self-sufficiency to      measure success. Refugees get a one-time payment of $925 to      $1,125 to start anew in the U.After that, the goal is to      help them find a job that pays enough to make them ineligible      for state aid. In 2015, Merdzanovic says, 75 percent of      employable adults resettled in Vermont were self-sufficient      within three months of arriving. By eight months, the figure      rose to 88 percent.       ``[If] we don't hear from them, we know they're working,      their kids are in school, they're driving, they have a car      and driver's license. That's a success,'' she says.       In Burlington, refugees' biggest challenge is affordable      housing. Timsina, the Bhutanese grocer, says some refugees      have moved to Ohio or Pennsylvania because of Burlington's      high rents--at least $1,500 a month for a three-bedroom      apartment. That's one reason Rutland appealed to       But accepting Rutland's application to become a      resettlement site for Syrians has exposed VRRP to something      it hasn't dealt with elsewhere: angry opposition. ``It's very      different,'' says ``It's new waters for all of      us.''       As Rutland Mayor Chris Louras crosses a downtown street      corner, an SUV pulls up. ``Hey, Louras!'' shouts the      passenger.       ``Mr.Congressman!'' says the mayor.       Peter Welch, Vermont's lone member of the House of      Representatives, is the passenger, and he's not at all      surprised to find the mayor giving an interview about his      support for refugees. Welch is quick to say that he and      Vermont's senators back Louras' effort.       ``All three of us support accepting refugees in the      country--America needs to do its share--but the real hard      work is in the communities where people are going to land and      live,'' Welch says.       It hasn't been easy, but Louras, an Army veteran who still      sports a soldier's buzz cut, has a history of charging ahead.      That's what Louras did last November, when Vermont Governor      Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, announced that he, unlike several      Republican governors, would continue to welcome Syrian      refugees to his state.[[Page S966]]       ``I saw that as an opportunity,'' Louras says, ``not just      to do the right thing--to open our doors to a people who are      fleeing for their lives--but also to do the right thing for      the community.'' Louras says Syrian refugees could give      Rutland a population boost and more cultural and ethnic      diversity, which in turn could help the town attract and      retain millennials.       ``Our population is crashing,'' Louras says. Though Rutland      is one of Vermont's largest cities, that doesn't mean it's      very big. About 16,000 people live there, down from 19,000 in      1970. Louras, mayor for nine years, has worked to turn it      around. He says downtown occupancy is at 95 percent, up from      75 percent when he started. But Rutland has been hit hard by      the opioid epidemic and the subprime mortgage crisis.      Absentee landlords have neglected their properties, leaving      the city to step in with garbage pickup and grass-mowing.      Refugees, he says, could revitalize the city's hardest-hit      neighborhoods.       ``In Burlington and Winooski, new Americans really take      pride in where they live and become very engaged community      members.'' Besides, he says, the town's economy needs      workers: Unemployment is below 4 percent in Rutland County,      and the region's top employers, Rutland Regional Medical      Center and a GE aviation plant, have trouble finding new      employees.       So, after talking with State Department and Homeland      Security officials, VRRP, the local school district and major      regional employers, Louras announced in April that Rutland      would apply to welcome 100 refugees a year, starting with 100      A supportive group, Rutland Welcomes, organized      almost immediately to prepare for the Syrians' arrival. So      did opposition.       ``These are the same people or many of the same who danced      in the street celebrating 9/11, the same people who hate      us,'' read a change.org petition against the resettlement,      with more than 400 supporters. Another group, Rutland First,      also launched fierce criticisms of the refugee resettlement      plan and hosted national anti-immigration speakers Philip      Haney and James Simpson in       Some critics complained that Louras had acted secretly by      not informing the city's board of aldermen. ``To keep it a      big, fat, frickin' secret until it's too late obviously      breeds mistrust,'' says Rutland City Treasurer Wendy       In a July meeting, the aldermen narrowly rejected a      petition to hold a nonbinding citywide referendum on refugee      resettlement. Instead, they voted to send a letter to the      State Department saying they weren't ready to endorse the      idea.       ``The last thing I wanted was for Rutland to be tarred [as]      the community that voted on whether or not Muslims could be      our neighbors,'' says Will Notte, president of the aldermen,      who supports resettlement. ``We never voted on Italians      coming. We didn't vote on the This is not something      that is meant to be decided at the ballot box.''       Rutland alderman Scott Tommola, who voted to send the      question to the ballot, says he's not opposed to taking in      refugees. ``I've met very few who are adamantly opposed to      this,'' Tommola says. ``The majority of people I talk to are      cautiously optimistic.'' But he isn't convinced that the city      has the jobs, housing and education capacity to take in 100      refugees a year. ``Show me these jobs and the housing that's      adequate,'' he says.       In August, at a Rutland First meeting, Wilton claimed that      taking in refugees will cause Rutland's property taxes to      rise. She predicts they'll drive up English-language learning      costs in local schools, and their housing needs will require      the city to spend more on community development. ``It could      be much more difficult than we think to help these folks,''      she says. Louras and others have disputed Wilton's figures.      The mayor says taking in refugees won't cost City Hall a      thing, and the schools superintendent says the district has      excess capacity for teaching       Wilton, like Rutland First, says she isn't completely      opposed to taking in refugees--maybe 25 a year would be OK,      she says. But she's concerned that they'll take jobs from      native Vermonters and that there aren't enough middle-class      jobs in town to offer economic mobility. She also has      security concerns about admitting Syrians to the U.S., citing      intelligence concerns that ISIS can generate fake passports      and may try to infiltrate the West through refugee flows.      ``We're more than likely to end up, out of 10,000, 20,000      people, to have some folks here that don't have our best      interests at heart,'' she says.       Louras says he's confident that the federal vetting process      is solid: ``Individuals who want to do us harm are not going      to come through refugee resettlement.''       In late September, the State Department approved Rutland as      a new home for refugees. Louras says 75 Syrians from either      the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan or camps in Lebanon, plus      25 Iraqis, should arrive in December or       Notte says he's confident that most Rutland residents      support the refugees' arrival. He says meetings of Rutland      Welcomes attract much larger audiences than resettlement's      vocal opponents. The refugees' supporters have organized a      furniture donation drive and begun holding free weekly Arabic      lessons at the Unitarian Universalist       ``Vermont is desperately in need of young working people,''      Notte says. ``It's a match made in heaven.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS964-3.txt,1383,REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY,2017.0,6.0,February

7999,topic-id,1458,"Mr.President, I will be speaking later tonight, perhaps about 2 o'clock, possibly on through 4 o'clock, but I wanted to take a few moments now and share some of the letter that was discussed earlier and share it in a fashion that is appropriate under our rules. I would like to thank very much my colleague from New Jersey for yielding a few minutes in order to do so.  I think it is important for us to understand the context of what this letter was all about. This letter was a statement of Coretta Scott King, and it was dated Thursday, March 13, 1986. She noted: ``My longstanding commitment which I shared with my husband Martin''--of course that is Martin Luther King--``to protect and enhance the rights of black Americans, rights which include equal access to the Democratic process, tells me to testify today.'' Then in her letter she goes on to essentially present an essay about the essential role of voting rights in our country, and so I will continue to read in that regard. She says:       The Voting Rights Act was and still is vitally important to      the future of democracy in the United I was      privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to      Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was      particularly impressed by the determination to get the      franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry As      he wrote--  Now she is quoting Martin Luther King--       ``Certainly no community in the history of the negro      struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and her      neighboring[[Page S865]]     town of Where Birmingham depended largely upon      students and unemployed adults to participate in nonviolent      protests of the denial of the franchise, Selma has involved      fully 10 percent of the negro population in active      demonstrations and at least half the negro population of      Marion was arrested on 1 day.''  That was the end of the quote from her husband. She continued writing:       Martin was referring, of course, to a group that included      the defendants recently prosecuted for assisting elderly and      illiterate blacks to exercise that franchise.  Each time she refers to franchise, she is referring to this fundamental right to vote under our  And she continued:       In fact, Martin anticipated from the depth of their      commitment 20 years ago, that a united political organization      would remain in Perry County long after the other marchers      had left. This organization, the Perry County Civic League,      started by Mr.Turner, Mr.Hogue, and others, as Martin      predicted, continued ``to direct the drive for votes and      other rights.''  That is a quote from her husband. And then she continued. In this letter, she says:       In the years since the Voting Rights Act was passed, Black      Americans in Marion, Selma, and elsewhere have made important      strides in their struggle to participate actively in the      electoral process. The number of Blacks registered to vote in      key Southern states has doubled [she said] since 1965. This      would not have been possible without the Voting Rights  She continues in her essay. She says:       However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal      participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the      South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to      the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the      voters. It has been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the      vital legislation that protects the most fundamental right to      vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the      enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those      rights by Black people should not be elevated to the federal      bench.  She continues in her letter to note:       Twenty years ago, when we marched from Selma to Montgomery,      the fear of voting was real, as the broken bones and bloody      heads in Selma and Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote      at the time, ``it was not just a sick imagination that      conjured up the vision of a public official sworn to uphold      the law, who forced an inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro      children; who ordered the James Bevel to be chained to      his sickbed; who clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who      callously inflicted repeated brutalities and indignities upon      nonviolent Negroes peacefully petitioning for their      constitutional right to vote.  This is what Martin Luther King is referring to was the specific actions of sheriffs in the South who were representing the law. And then Coretta Scott King continued:       Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to      American democracy that we cannot tolerate any form of      infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been      disenfranchised in our nation's history, none has struggled      longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than      Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box      denied so persistently and intently.       Over the past century, a broad array of schemes have been      used in attempts to block the Black vote. The range of      techniques developed with the purpose of repressing black      voting rights run the gamut from the straightforward      application of brutality against black citizens who tried to      vote, to such legalized frauds as ``grandfather clause''      exclusions and rigged literacy tests.  Now she proceeds to note that other techniques were used to intimidate Black voters and that included investigations into the absentee voting process, and this concerned her a great deal. And she notes that Whites have been using the absentee process to their advantage for years without incident. Then, when Blacks, realizing its strength, began to use it with success, criminal investigations were begun.  Then she proceeds to address that there were occasions where individuals with legal authority chose to initiate cases specifically against African Americans while ignoring allegations of similar behavior by Whites, ``choosing instead to chill the exercise of the franchise by Blacks by his misguided investigation.''  Let me continue later in the letter. She addresses her concern over the prosecution illegally withholding from the defense critical statements made by witnesses and that witnesses who did testify were pressured and intimidated into submitting the ``correct'' testimony. That is incorrect testimony.       Many elderly Blacks were visited multiple times by the FBI      who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand jury in      Mobile when they could have more easily testified at a grand      jury twenty miles away in These voters, and others,      have announced they are now never going to vote again.  She obviously is addressing issue after issue that affected the Black franchise, the franchise of African Americans, the ability to vote, and then she returns to her essay about how important this is.       The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by      which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will      be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil      right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately      results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it is      only when the poor and disadvantaged are empowered that they      are able to participate actively in the solutions to their      own problems.  Coretta Scott King continues:       We still have a long way to go before we can say that      minorities no longer need to be concerned about      discrimination at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native      Americans and Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented at      every level of government in If we are going to make      our timeless dream of justice through democracy a reality, we      must take every possible step to ensure that the spirit and      intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fifteenth      Amendment of the Constitution is honored.       The federal courts hold a unique position in our      constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other      citizens without political power have a forum in which to      vindicate their rights. Because of this unique role, it is      essential that the people selected to be federal judges      respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for      individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all.       The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they      protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel confident      that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge      with fairness others holding differing views.  And she concludes her letter having examined a number of incidents in the historical record with this conclusion:       I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite      judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights      guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for      appointment to the federal district court.  And that is the context of her letter; that voting rights matter a tremendous amount. I applaud the efforts of my colleague from Massachusetts to make this point and share this essay with the body of the Senate earlier this evening.

7739,topic-id,577,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.725, the misnamed Innocent Party Protection The main purpose of this bill is to make it easier to remove State cases to Federal courts, where large corporate defendants have numerous advantages over consumers and injured workers.                              {time}  1515  Let's not talk about the emotional devastation. We are talking about large, corporate defendants. We are not worried about their emotions. Their litigation departments are quite capable of handling the emotions.  This bill will clog the Federal courts, drain judicial resources, upset well-established law, and delay justice for plaintiffs seeking to hold businesses accountable for the injuries they cause. It is yet another attempt by the Republican majority to stack the deck in favor of large corporations.  This bill is the opening salvo of this week's series of bills by the Republicans to close off access to the courts to ordinary With every step they take, whether it be to remove more State cases to Federal courts, to make class action suits more difficult to bring, or to reclassify more lawsuits as frivolous and subject to mandatory sanctions, they are limiting access to court help for ordinary  The so-called Innocent Party Protection Act would upend the century-old doctrine of fraudulent joinder, in which a defendant from the same State as the plaintiff is improperly added to a case in order to defeat diversity jurisdiction in Federal court, and, therefore, keep the case in a State court. Under current law, a defendant claiming fraudulent rejoinder has the burden of showing that there is ``no reasonable basis'' for a claim against the instate defendant, and, therefore, the case should remain in Federal court.  This bill would turn that process on its head by placing the burden on the plaintiff to show that there is a ``plausible'' claim against the instate defendant and that the plaintiff has a ``good faith intention'' to pursue a claim against that defendant. Both standards are undefined in the bill, but it is likely that many plaintiffs would find these hurdles impossible to overcome at the initial stages of litigation before discovery.[[Page H1971]]  Furthermore, defendants will use this forum shopping bill to delay justice by routinely challenging jurisdiction. It will drain court time and allow corporate defendants to force plaintiffs to expend their limited resources on what should be a simple procedural matter. Under this bill, the preliminary determination of jurisdiction would become a baseless, time-consuming mini-trial before a second time-consuming trial on the merits. While large corporations could easily accommodate such costs, injured workers, consumers, and patients cannot.  The practical effect of this bill is to force cases based on State law, which should properly be heard in State courts, to be considered in our overburdened Federal courts instead. Large corporations generally believe that Federal courts are a friendlier forum, especially since they are overburdened and they can afford to wait whereas the plaintiffs cannot, and they believe that they have a better chance of escaping liability for their actions in the Federal court.  There is no evidence of a systemic crisis of fraudulent joinder, nor is there evidence that the courts cannot properly handle whatever issues may arise under current law. There is certainly no evidence that what wealthy corporations need are greater advantages in the courts. Yet, this bill hands them yet another gift from the Republican majority, and it is ordinary consumers and injured workers who will suffer.  Mr.Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.

7854,topic-id,306,"Madam Speaker, Republicans are continuing their crusade to cut off access to comprehensive family planning services. Last year they tried to zero out title X in their budget. This year they intend to repeal ACA's cost-free contraception coverage for women with private insurance. Today Republicans are attempting to stop the flow of title X grants to health centers around the country.  Title X grants ensure that low-income families have access to birth control and can plan their pregnancies so that moms and kids stay healthy. Research has shown that without these vital services, the unintended pregnancy rate would be 33 percent higher and the number of abortions would also be higher. My anti-choice Republican colleagues should cheer this program, but instead not only are Republicans trying to defund Planned Parenthood so they won't be able to provide contraception help, but now we are hypocritically rolling back a rule that allows title X funds to flow to reproductive health centers, which are the most effective providers of title X services and which we were told would provide the contraception and other health services that Planned Parenthood no longer would be able to.                              {time}  1445  Women are watching us today.

Annual provisions, including the Hyde amendment, have been passed repeatedly and have saved an estimated 2 million innocent lives.  Today, we rise again to stop the taxpayer funding of abortion providers. I want to be clear. Nothing we do today will take a penny from women's health. Instead, we are empowering States to redirect these funds to community health centers and hospitals that offer more comprehensive coverage to women.  In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood performed more than 300,000 abortions while failing to provide even the most basic services, like prenatal care, at many of their facilities.  Hospitals and federally qualified health centers not only offer a broader range of services, but also greater accessibility in many cases. While there is only one Planned Parenthood center in South Dakota, we have six federally qualified health centers that operate in 45 service sites and serve more than 54,000 individuals per year. These care centers offer low-income families health services, but they don't perform abortions. We can support women's health--and, specifically, health care for low-income women--without supporting abortion providers.  Simply put, H.43 does not restrict access or funding to health care for low-income women. What it does do is help protect taxpayers from funding abortion providers. It empowers the States to direct healthcare funding to organizations that truly do support women's health, and it makes strides toward protecting the most vulnerable among us, the unborn.

This resolution is simply another attack on women's health and another attempt by Republicans to limit women's access to high-quality, essential care.  For decades, title X family planning program has funded grants that provide millions of Americans each year with access to a broad range of preventive health services, including contraception care and cancer screenings. Title X is a critical safety net for low-income women and teens; and for many patients, this program is their only source of health care.[[Page H1270]]  But the Republicans want to limit access to these services and allow States to discriminate against certain providers, all as part of their ongoing ideological crusade against abortion.  I stress, this resolution would permit States to prohibit reproductive healthcare providers from participating in the title X program, and would allow States to block access to care if the provider separately performs abortions or is affiliated with health centers that do.  Now, we already have seen what happens when States take actions to discriminate against providers in the title X program. Access goes down, the unintended pregnancy rate goes up, and the spread of sexually transmitted infections increases.  So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution because Republicans should not be entitled to pick and choose providers in the title X program and play politics with women's health.

Congressional oversight is a power granted by the Constitution in public law and in House rules.  Mr.Speaker, just 2 days ago, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that there was an investigation of Donald Trump's campaign's ties to the Russian agents.  We know that, following six bankruptcies, Donald Trump had trouble getting loans and financing for his real estate businesses. We know that German Bank Deutsche stepped in when Wall Street stopped lending, giving at least $300 million in loans for those properties and, more personally, to his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law.  We know that Deutsche Bank has been fined for criminally transferring $10 billion out of We also know that Donald Trump, said that the Trump organization saw money ``pouring in from Russia'' and that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.''  We know that Donald Trump repeatedly attempted to secure trademarks in Russia--the record is the record--to develop real estate in Russia--the record is the record--and to sell products in Russia--the record is the record. We have seen how just two pages summarizing the President's 2005 tax returns, which many laughed off, showed that he paid a low rate of 25 percent.

8062,topic-id,192,"Mr.Speaker, last night President Trump delivered a speech that was long on campaign themes but short on specifics. It seems the President is more interested in political theater than leadership, and it showed. He was very vague on every topic he discussed, from health care to trade, to tax reform.  The campaign is over, but it is clear President Trump hasn't moved on. Where is his interest in governing and in leading this Nation? I don't see it. Just the day before, in his speech, he discovered that health care is unbelievably complex.  Every day since the inauguration President Trump has shown that he is ill-prepared, ill-tempered, and ill-informed, and he does not understand what governing is about. His speech did not change that.  It is time for President Trump to stop talking about bringing this country together and actually make an effort to do so. He needs to engage Congress, including the Congressional Black He needs to move from platitudes to plans, and he also needs to act on the priorities of the American people.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under this plan, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, and millions of other families will pay more for worse coverage. At the same time, the Republicans' bill rolls back Medicaid expansion and allows insurers to charge older enrollees more.  We always knew that the House Republican plan would harm the most vulnerable Americans, but we still do not know how much this bill will cost and how many Americans it will cover.  Now, House Republicans prefer it this way. They know that their bill will cover far fewer people than the Affordable Care Act does. They want to hide this fact from the American people and rush this bill through committee.

The resolution we are debating today threatens access to these critical services.  Every year, Maine's network of title X providers serves more than 22,000 individuals in nearly every county, including some of the most rural and underserved communities in our Sixty-five percent of last year's patients had outcomes that qualified them for free or reduced-cost services.  Family planning health centers often end up being their patients' primary source of health care. Providers are trusted members of the community. The care they deliver is high quality, and often they are the only affordable local option. Without title X funds, thousands of women and men throughout Maine would struggle to access and afford alternative primary care.

The Clerk read as follows:  Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first;  Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public;  Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate can be influenced by foreign entities and reveal any conflicts of interest;  Whereas, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution states that no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of Congress, accept any present, emolument, Office or Title, of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or foreign State;[[Page H2309]]  Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns is important towards investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election, understanding the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing agreements with Russia or Russian nationals, formally or informally associated with Vladmir Putin;  Whereas, The New York Times has reported that President Trump's close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation;  Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016, that ``there were contacts'' with Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump's inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign;  Whereas, General Michael Flynn, former national security adviser of President Trump, received almost $68,000 in fees and expenses from Russian entities in 2015, including by an entity recognized by U.intelligence agencies as an arm of the Russian Government;  Whereas, FBI Director Comey stated in the Select Intelligence Committee hearing on the Russian interference with the November 2016 election that ``there is no information to support those tweets,'' relating to President Trump's allegations that President Obama illegally wiretapped the Trump campaign;  Whereas, distracting investigators with dead-end leads and outrageous statements is a common tactic from those with a guilty conscience or in a deliberate effort to throw off investigators;  Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world;  Whereas, according to The Washington Post, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, has hired a ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations;  Whereas, the chairman on the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the tax code;  Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise:  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives shall:  One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives;  Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns.

7736,topic-id,1092,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, we have seen a number of bills this session which are designed to shut the door on victims of corporate misfeasance and negligence and to nail the door shut. H.725 is part of this wave of legislation.  Like most other bills we have seen this session with brazenly Orwellian titles, the so-called Innocent Party Protection Act of 2017 has nothing to do with protecting innocent parties. Rather, it is just the latest attempt to tilt the civil justice system dramatically in favor of big corporate defendants by making it much more difficult for plaintiffs to pursue State law claims in State courts under the system of federalism designed by our  Again, this is a familiar experience because the bill addresses a completely nonexistent problem. If there had been a real problem, the Judiciary Committee might have held a hearing in which we could have invited groups to come forward who support tort victims. They could have come and testified about why it was so important for the interests of civil justice for us to pass this legislation.  But there was no hearing at all. We didn't hear any witnesses, much less the testimony of those groups that represent victims of mass toxic torts, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, sex discrimination lawsuits--none of it.  In fact, the groups that we would have called, if we were interested in the testimony of victims and people seeking civil justice, oppose this legislation overwhelmingly: the Alliance for Justice opposes it; the Center for Justice and Democracy opposes it; the Consumer Federation of America opposes it; the National Association of Consumer Advocates opposes it; the National Consumer Law Center opposes it; the Natural Resources Defense Council opposes it; Public Citizen opposes it; the Sierra Club opposes it.  Under current law, a defendant may remove a case, alleging State law claims, to a Federal court only if there is complete diversity of citizenship between all plaintiffs and all defendants. If the plaintiff adds an instate defendant to the case solely for the purpose of defeating jurisdiction, this constitutes fraudulent joinder today; and in such circumstances, the case may be removed directly to Federal court.  In determining whether a joinder was fraudulent, the court considers only whether there was any basis for a claim against the nondiverse defendant. The defendant must show that there was no possibility of recovery or no reasonable basis for adding the nondiverse defendant to the suit.  This very high standard has guided our Federal courts for more than a century and it has functioned well, and the bill's proponents offer no objective evidence to the contrary. And again, we have had no hearing. For a new Member of Congress like me, who comes from the Maryland State Senate, I am absolutely astonished and amazed that we would think of overturning a standard fixture in our civil justice system without so much as a hearing as to what the problem is.  H.725 would replace a time-honored standard with an ambiguous one that would dramatically increase the costs and burdens of litigation on plaintiffs in Federal courts. It would try to strip our State courts of their basic powers to hear cases relating to their citizens. This is an assault on federalism.  The measure would require a court to deny a motion remanding to the State[[Page H1970]]courts unless the court finds, one, that it is ``plausible to conclude that applicable State law would impose liability'' on an instate defendant; two, that the plaintiff had a ``good faith intention to prosecute the action against each'' instate defendant or to seek a joint judgment; and three, that there was no ``actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts.''  This gauntlet of hurdles suddenly shifts the burden and creates a presumption that a Federal court should hear the case, making it far more expensive and difficult for plaintiffs to have their cases heard in State court.  H.725 would effectively overturn the local defendant exception, which prohibits removal to Federal court even if complete diversity of citizenship exists when the defendant is a citizen of the State where the suit was filed.  The bill's radical changes to longstanding jurisdictional practice reveal the authentic purpose behind the measure. It is simply intended to stifle the ability of plaintiffs to have their choice of forum and, possibly, even their day in court.  In addition, H.725 would sharply increase the cost of litigation for plaintiffs and further burden the Federal court system. For example, the meanings of terms like ``plausible'' and ``good faith intention'' are ambiguous and will spawn substantial litigation over their proper interpretation and application, further postponing decisions and justice.  Additionally, these standards would require a court to engage in a mini-trial during the early procedural stages of the case without any opportunity for the full development of evidence. Again, this would sharply increase the burdens and costs of litigation for ordinary citizens, for plaintiffs, which appears to be, to my mind, the only possible contemplated result of this legislation.  Finally, we need to focus on the fact that this bill offered by the majority raises profound federalism concerns, which I would have hoped they would be attentive to. Matters of State law should be decided by State courts, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the  It was our constitutional design that matters of civil dispute and conflict go to State courts, State judges, and State juries, all of them closer to the people themselves, unless you have a Federal question, a matter of Federal statutory law, a matter of Federal constitutional law, or you have got diversity jurisdiction.  H.725 bulldozes this key federalism constraint and casts a shadow, unnecessarily and improperly, over State courts, the courts of the people. By applying sweeping and vaguely worded new standards to the determination of when a State case must be remanded to State court, the bill denies State courts the ability to decide and, ultimately, to shape the unfolding of State law. This is completely contrary to the design of the Founders, many of them Virginians, like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and George Mason, who wanted the State courts to be the central arena for the resolution of civil conflicts and tort disputes.  Simply put, H.725 tramples State sovereignty and our basic constitutional structure. For these reasons and for the fact that nobody has demonstrated there is a real problem, I urge the House to resist this unnecessary and flawed legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

7743,topic-id,569,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I think that we are actually progressing in our discussion of the issue because we presently have a law against fraudulent joinder. They simply want to make it far more difficult for plaintiffs to get justice in State courts. The law already makes it impossible to fraudulently join someone.  So in the case offered by the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, I could very much see an out-of-State corporate behemoth that owns nursing homes across the country saying that all of this should be in Federal court because the person who actually committed the sexual assault instate is judgment-proof because they don't have any money and that is not really a plausible opportunity to recover, and, therefore, it should stay in Federal court.  The grand irony here, Mr.Chairman, is that the party which sings lullabies about federalism and states' rights is in the business of stripping our State courts and our people of the opportunity to get into State court. All of this is about forcing everybody into Federal court. I remember a President who recently said in his inaugural address that the whole sum and substance of his administration is to give power back to the States and back to the people, but this legislation is designed to wreck federalism and to force everybody into Federal court where the big corporate defendants and the fancy lawyers have every conceivable advantage over people who are just trying to get justice when they have been injured in their  Mr.Chairman, the substantive issues at stake here are obviously complex, and I would invite all Americans to try to research what is going on. But if you don't have the time to actually study the more than a century in which we have had current fraudulent joinder rules and you don't have time to go and examine the bill as submitted by the majority, then just consider the procedure that has gotten us to this point.  There has been no hearing on this bill, there has been no call for this bill by anybody who has been injured in a civil tort case, and all of the groups that try to stand up for citizens against the largest corporations who are bankrolled by billions of dollars and are trying to force everybody these days into arbitration and to shut the courthouse door, all of those groups are opposed to the legislation because they understand what it is going to do.  It is going to make it far more difficult for people to prosecute civil[[Page H1972]]claims when they have been injured in something like a sexual harassment case, a sexual violence case, a discrimination case, an asbestos poisoning case, or a mass toxic tort. It is going to be far more difficult for people to get justice in their State courts.  Apparently, the interests of the large corporate polluters and inflictors of injuries--tortfeasors--are so important that we are willing to trample the basic principles of our constitutional design which is that these kinds of cases go into State court for State resolution, we reserve the Federal courts for complicated questions of Federal law and real cases of diversity jurisdiction, not phony cases of diversity jurisdiction where they try to eliminate the instate defendant, but real cases of diversity jurisdiction where nobody else is involved.

7830,topic-id,324,"Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.43. Congress must use its authority to strike this rule and stop the Federal Government from forcing States to funnel taxpayer money to abortion providers.  This rule is wrong on process and it is wrong on policy. First of all, States have every right to put in place reasonable guidelines for how their Federal dollars are spent. For Washington to attempt to coerce States in this way would be bad enough, but for unelected bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human Services to go around Congress at the eleventh hour of the Obama administration is just outrageous.  Madam Speaker, I think we all agree that low-income women should have access to essential title X services, but why is it necessary for those services to be funded at the Nation's largest provider of abortion? It isn't, of course, but the abortion industry and its supporters want us to believe that it is.  When it comes to funding, they like to pretend that abortion doesn't exist and that Planned Parenthood is the only place where women can get health care, but that is not true. The truth is that there are more than 13,000 federally qualified and rural health centers that offer low-cost health care to women. These centers outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1; they just don't preform abortions.  Understanding this, some States have rightly enacted laws and policies redirecting title X dollars away from abortion providers and toward these noncontroversial clinics. If the true goal here were to ensure women's health care, no one should have a problem with that. But that wasn't the goal, and everybody knows it.  There is a reason people call this rule President Obama's parting gift to Planned It was a blatant, transparent attempt to preserve the[[Page H1271]]pipeline of funding to the Nation's largest abortion business.

After these clinics were called and asked, Do you provide prenatal services, not one had any such services to offer, but they did offer terminations. Planned Parenthood has since removed[[Page H1274]]the word ``prenatal'' from their booking appointments website.

7994,topic-id,1638,"The reason I ask that is the following--but I think we all feel very passionate about the issues before us. I have not been here as long as Senator Leahy, whose service has been quite distinguished over a long period of time. I truly do understand the passions people bring to this body. I like to think that I, too, am passionate about the issues before us.  I think this is an important moment. It is late. Not many people are paying attention. I wish they would though because I think the question here is one of the reasons I ran for this body to begin with. Maybe it is because of my background; I am surrounded by people who have lost freedoms in places where they are not allowed to speak. One of the great traditions of our Nation is the ability to come forward and have debates.  But the Founders and the Framers and those who established this institution and guided us over two centuries understood that that debate was impossible if, in fact, the matter became of a personal nature. I don't believe that was necessarily the intention here, although perhaps that was the way it turned out. But I think it is important for us to understand why that matters so much.  I want people to think about our politics here in America because I am telling you guys, I don't know of a single Nation in the history of the world that has been able to solve its problems when half the people in the country absolutely hate the other half of the people in that country. This is the most important country in the world, and this body cannot function if people are offending one another, and that is why those rules are in place.  I was not here when Secretary Clinton was nominated as a Member of this body at the time, but I can tell you that I am just barely old enough to know that some very nasty things have been written and said about Senator And I think the Senate should be very proud that during her nomination to be Secretary of State--despite the fact that I imagine many people were not excited about the fact that she would be Secretary of State--to my recollection, and perhaps I am incorrect, not a single one of those horrible things that have been written or said about her, some of which actually did accuse her of wrongdoing, was uttered on the floor of the  I happen to remember in 2004 when then-Senator Kerry ran for Some pretty strong things were written and said about him. I was here for that when he was nominated and confirmed to be Secretary of And I don't recall a single statement being read into the Record about the things that have been said about him.  Now, I want everybody to understand that at the end of the night, this is not a partisan issue. It really is not. I can tell you this with full confidence that if one of my colleagues on this side of the aisle had done that, I would also like to think that I would have been one of those people objecting, and here is why.  Turn on the news and watch these parliaments around the world where people throw chairs at each other and throw punches, and ask yourself: How does that make you feel about those countries? It doesn't give you a lot of confidence about those countries. I am not arguing that we are anywhere near that tonight, but we are flirting with it. We are flirting with it in this body, and we are flirting with it in this country. We are becoming a society incapable of having debates anymore.  In this country, if you watch the big policy debates that are going on in America, no one ever stops to say: I think you are wrong. I understand your point of view. I get it. You have some valid points, but let me tell you why I think my view is better. I don't hear that anymore.  Here is what I hear almost automatically--and let me be fair--from both sides of these debates. Immediately, immediately, as soon as you offer an idea, the other side jumps and says that the reason you say that is because you don't care about poor people, because you only care about rich people, because you are this or you are that or you are the other. And I am just telling you guys, we are reaching a point in this Republic where we are not going to be able to solve the simplest of issues because everyone is putting themselves in the corner where everyone hates everybody.  Now I don't pretend to say that I am not myself from time to time in heated debates outside of this forum. I have been guilty of perhaps hyperbole, and for those--I am not proud of it.  But I have to tell you, I think what is at stake here tonight and as we debate moving forward is not simply some rule but the ability of the most important Nation on Earth to debate in a productive and respectful way the pressing issues before us. I just hope we understand that because I have tremendous respect for the other Chamber, and I understand that it was designed to be different. But one of the reasons I chose to run for the Senate and, quite frankly, to run for reelection is that I believed I served with 99 other men and women who deeply love their country, who have different points of view, who represent men and women who have different views from the men and women whom I may represent on a given issue and who are here to advocate for their points of view, never impugning their motives.  One of the things I take great pride in--and I tell this to people all the time--is that the one thing you learn about the Senate is, whether you agree with them or not, you understand why every single one of those other 99 people are here. They are intelligent people, they are smart people, they are[[Page S858]]hard-working people. They believe in what they are saying, and they articulate it in a very passionate and effective way.  When I see my colleague stand up and say something I don't agree with, I try to tell myself: Look, I don't understand why they stand for that, but I know why they are doing it. It is because they represent people who believe that.  I am so grateful that God has allowed me to be born, to live, and to raise my family in a nation where people with such different points of view are able to debate those things in a way that doesn't lead to war, that doesn't lead to overthrows, that doesn't lead to violence. And you may take that for granted.  All around the world tonight, there are people who, if they stood up here and said the things that we say about the President or others in authority, they would go to jail. I am not saying that is where we are headed as a nation; I am just saying, don't ever take that for granted.  The linchpin of that is this institution. The linchpin of that debate is the ability of this institution through unlimited debate and the decorum necessary for that debate to be able to conduct itself in that manner.  I know that tonight was probably a made-for-TV moment for some people. This has nothing to do with censuring the words of some great heroes. I have extraordinary admiration for the men and women who led the civil rights effort in this country, and I am self-conscious or understanding enough to know that many of the things that have been possible for so many people in this country in the 21st century were made possible by the sacrifices and the work of those who came before us.  This has to do with a fundamental reality, and that is that this body cannot carry out its work if it is not able to conduct debates in a way that is respectful of one another, especially those of us who are in this Chamber together.  I also understand this: If the Senate ceases to work, if we reach a point where this institution--given everything else that is going on in politics today, where you are basically allowed to say just about anything, for I have seen over the last year and a half things said about people, about issues, about institutions in our republic that I never thought I would see ever--ever. If we lose this body's ability to conduct debate in a dignified manner--and I mean this with no disrespect to anyone else. I don't believe anyone came on the floor here tonight saying: I am going to be disrespectful on purpose and turn this into a circus. But I am just telling you that if this body loses the ability to have those sorts of debates, then where in this country is that going to happen? In what other forum in this Nation is that going to be possible?  So I would just hope everybody would stop and think about that. I know I have been here only for 6 years, so I don't have a deep reservoir of Senate history to rely on. But I know this: If this body isn't capable of having those debates, there will be no place in this country where those debates can occur. I think every single one of us, to our great shame, will live to regret it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Democratic leader.

7856,topic-id,260,"Madam Speaker, well, here we are again, considering legislation that would harm women and families.  Let's be clear: House Republicans do not support family planning title For years, Republicans have tried to completely eliminate funding for title X through the appropriations process. So think about that. We are debating contraception in 2017--astonishing.  Title X provides millions of low- and middle-income men and women with access to reproductive healthcare services. The joint resolution we are voting on today would allow States to discriminate against title X providers who perform abortion with non-Federal funds by removing them from the program, leaving patients with few options for the care they need.  Again, let's be clear. If you want to reduce the number of abortions, you need to ensure everyone has access to family planning. Teen pregnancy and the rate of abortion are at historic lows because we have worked to make contraception more affordable and accessible.  For over 60 percent of title X patients, the clinics they visit for family planning services are their only regular source of care, and yet we are considering legislation that would result in clinic closures and would prevent men and women from seeing trusted providers in their own communities.  Do Republicans oppose cancer screening for cervical breast cancer? Do they oppose STI testing? Do they oppose contraception?

8057,topic-id,664,"Mr.Speaker, it was 7 years ago today that the Affordable Care Act passed and changed the lives of so many millions of Americans who previously couldn't get health care. But I think we knew even at the time that a big bill like this, a transformative piece of legislation like this, over time would require some changes, just as Social Security and Medicare have done.  The truth of the matter is, for 7 years, as we heard Republicans complaining about what was happening, we said: Let's sit down together, as Members of Congress, representatives of the people, and fix what we have got and build on the things that have made it possible for all these millions of people to have not only health care, but better health care.  Instead, what we heard over and over again is: Repeal ObamaCare; repeal And I kind of feel like today what we have is, because they said that, then they feel like they have to fulfill a promise. But if you look at what they are offering, it really hurts so many  What I hope the American people will understand is that the so-called repeal-and-replace bill raises the cost of premiums and out-of-pocket costs. People are going to pay more and get less.  Twenty-four million people--that is just a start; it ends up being some 50 million people after some years--will lose their coverage altogether.  It represents the single largest transfer of wealth to the top richest Americans and corporations. We are talking about $600 billion in tax relief. There is not a lot of talk about that. In many ways, this is a tax cut for the richest being masked as a healthcare bill.  Finally, I want to really focus in on what we call the age tax. Well, before I was a senior citizen myself, I have worked with older Americans in the State of Illinois, where I am from, and here in Congress as well.  So what is this age tax? This bill says that people who are between the age of 50--not very old--and 64, in other words, pre-Medicare, will be allowed to be charged five times more than young people for their health care. Actually, it allows the States even to go more than five times more for their health care. It will lower the subsidies.  As has been said many times, here is just an example. If you are 64 years old with an income of around $26,500--which, by the way, is the median income for people that age, certainly not a wealthy person--you would pay, under this bill, the Republican bill, $14,600 for premiums--think of that--as compared to $1,700 today, an increase of $12,900. So it is not surprising that the Congressional Budget Office predicts that many of those people will simply have to give up their health care.  The reason they want to charge them more is to entice younger people, who will then pay lower premiums, to actually get on the program. We are all for that. We want to make sure that young people get on. But people who are 50 to 64 are very likely, or more likely than young people, to have healthcare issues.  It is absolutely no wonder that so many organizations and forces are lining up in the United States to oppose this bill:  The American Medical Association, the doctors, and all the different subgroups of doctors, have written letters saying no to this repeal-and-replace.  The American Hospital Association, not only urban hospitals and hospitals in medically underserved areas, rural hospitals could go under.  The AARP, 35 million members strong, is absolutely dead set--they are running ads; some people may have seen them on television--against this legislation.  The American Nurses Association, conservative think tanks are against it, and many Members of Congress are against it--and for good reason.

7928,topic-id,671,"Mr.President, I am really pleased to be able to join my colleague Senator Isakson from Georgia as we have introduced our bipartisan legislation, the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations I think this is a welcomed piece of bipartisan legislation at this point in the year.  I want to start by thanking the Senator from Georgia for his very good work on this legislation. He has been leading this effort since he first came to the Senate in 2005, and I have been fortunate enough to partner with him on the legislation in the past two  I think that by working together, we could pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that could change the way we do business in Washington for the better. As Senator Isakson said, there is no question that our budget process is broken.  Since 1980, we have only finished two budgets on time. In that timeframe, Congress has resorted to nearly 170 short-term funding bills or continuing resolutions. We also experienced a costly and dangerous government shutdown in October of 2013 that cost our economy $24 billion.  It hurt small businesses. It hurt the people across this country.  That is no way to govern. I understand, as Senator Isakson said, that biennial budgeting will not fix everything, but it is a reform that will encourage us to work across the aisle to become better stewards of taxpayer dollars. I can attest to this personally because, as Governor of New Hampshire, I saw how you make a biennial budget work.  In each biennium, I worked with a Republican legislature, and we put together a balanced budget in the first year of the legislative session. In the second year, we had the opportunity to do oversight. That is exactly what this bill would allow us to do here in It is a reform that has worked in New Hampshire, and it has worked in 18 other So as Senator Isakson said, 19 States in all have biennial budgeting, and it really gives us a better opportunity to review the budget to see what is working, what is effective, and what is not.  One example that I think shows how we can do this better is looking at several reports that have been issued by the Government Accountability They have found areas of waste, fraud, and duplicative programs. And they have identified ways to reform things, like our farm program, to cut down inefficiencies in defense, and to reduce fraud in health programs. But today, Congress hasn't really taken the time and effort to go through those recommendations. Under biennial budgeting, we would be able to look at those kinds of recommendations and implement savings in the second year of the budget process.  Biennial budgeting also reduces the number of opportunities for manufactured crises, like a government shutdown. As Senator Isakson said, we have gotten real momentum in the last couple of years. We had a great vote in 2013 in the Senate, where we had an overwhelming bipartisan group endorse the concept. We saw a vote in the House Budget Committee, where legislation on a biennial budget passed with a bipartisan vote. It not only passed the House but had over half of the House Members as cosponsors. And we saw a favorable hearing in the Senate Budget Committee on the legislation, so I think momentum is growing for this idea. It is a real way for us to take action to reform the budget process and make it work better.  The bill that we are introducing has 13 bipartisan cosponsors. We are going to keep working to get more bipartisan cosponsors, and I hope that all of our colleagues will join us in this effort.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Isakson and with Senators Enzi and Sanders on the Budget Committee to get this important reform through the  I yield the floor.

7933,topic-id,1380,"Mr.President, I came to the floor this afternoon to address the nominee for Attorney General of the United States, Mr.The U.Constitution provides that the Senate will advise and consent on all nominees put forward by the This fundamental check on Executive power continues to give confidence to the public that the individuals charged with the immense responsibilities and authorities of our Federal Government are of the highest ethical and professional character, are highly qualified, and are committed to exercising those powers in a manner that is consistent with our founding principles.  Any person seeking to serve in such high positions of public trust ought to be able to explain his or her record of personal and professional conduct, not only to close colleagues and friends but also to the public they seek to serve.  I have great respect for Senator Jeff Sessions for his commitment to public service, but I don't believe that he is the right choice to serve as our Nation's chief law enforcement officer. Time and again in the course of his career, his actions have demonstrated disinterest or even hostility to many of the civil rights that we rely on the Attorney General to protect and defend, from voting rights to civil rights, to equality for women, minorities, the LGBTQ community, and people with disabilities.  Senator Sessions' record in the Senate provides little evidence that his views have evolved since the last time the Senate evaluated his fitness to serve in high Federal office, when President Reagan nominated him to serve as a Federal judge in 1986. Three decades ago, the Senate voted against his confirmation to serve as Federal judge. Today, I believe the Senate should not confirm him to serve as U.Attorney  At this time in our history, with the growing concern about this administration's commitment to basic democratic principles, such as equality before the law, separation of powers, freedom of the press, and protection of minority views, I cannot support a nominee who has failed to demonstrate appreciation for these ideals, regardless of our personal relationship. We need an Attorney General who will fight for justice and equal protection for all Americans, regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.  One of my principal objections to this nominee is his record of making it harder for certain groups of people to vote. In 2013, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, also[[Page S843]]known as the preclearance provision. And while the overwhelming majority of civil rights organizations considered this ruling, which invalidated a landmark achievement of the civil rights movement--a devastating defeat--Senator Sessions was quoted as saying that it was a ``good thing for the South.'' He has been quoted as saying that he views the Voting Rights Act as an intrusive piece of legislation. We often refer to the shorthand name for this case, calling it simply Shelby But I believe the full title is instructive: Shelby County v. Holder, of course, was Attorney General Eric And in this case, the Supreme Court ruled against the Department of Justice and against the views of this Congress, which voted in 2006 to extend section 5 for another 25 years.  It also demonstrated the awesome responsibility and discretion of the Attorney Eric Holder was fighting to protect minorities in States with a history of racial discrimination from future voter suppression efforts. In contrast, as U.Attorney General, Jeff Sessions prosecuted several members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the great civil rights organization formerly led by Martin Luther King, He indicted these people for allegedly attempting to fraudulently register people in minority communities to vote. All of those counts were dismissed in that case. However, the chilling effect of this type of use of government authority on our civil society should not be underestimated. This illustrated the awesome power of the prosecutor in our judicial system. That power is exponentially greater in the Office of the U.Attorney  As I said, Senator Sessions is also an outspoken advocate for voter ID laws, including at the Federal level. In State after State, including my home State of New Hampshire, unnecessarily stringent voter ID laws have been passed by Republicans with the clear intent to deny access to the ballot box on the part of minorities, the young, and the poor. Striking down the laws passed by Republicans in North Carolina, a unanimous Federal court ruled that they ``target African Americans with almost surgical precision''--that is a direct quote--and ``impose cures for problems that did not exist.''  Invalidating similar laws in Wisconsin, U.District Court Judge James Peterson wrote: ``The Wisconsin experience demonstrates that a preoccupation with mostly phantom election fraud leads to real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in the elections, particularly in minority communities.''  President Trump has falsely claimed on numerous occasions that 3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants voted in the election in We have even heard that claim in New Hampshire, where our deputy secretary of State, a Republican, has said those claims are not accurate.  Throughout our history, these arguments, not grounded in fact and data, have been used as a pretext for advancing new voter ID laws, including at the national level. Yet, as Attorney General, Senator Sessions would enthusiastically support this agenda. I believe that to be disqualifying for any nominee to serve as Attorney  When I was Governor of New Hampshire, I had the honor of being able to appoint the attorney general in our My qualification was that the attorney general should be the people's attorney. I think that is no less true of the Attorney General of the United  I am also deeply concerned by the nominee's record on issues associated with women's health and autonomy. For example, as Senator Blumenthal said so eloquently earlier this afternoon: Senator Sessions voted against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women This law has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis each time it has been brought up since 1994.  The 2013 reauthorization expanded the scope of domestic violence programs, yet Senator Sessions was one of only 22 who voted no. This is of particular concern when we see the framework for what is suggested will be the Trump administration's budget, which would eliminate the Office on Violence Against Women at a time when one in five women is a victim of rape, either completed or attempted.  Senator Sessions has also been a fierce opponent of a woman's right to choose. He voted against a resolution supporting the Roe v. Wade decision, which affirmed the constitutional right of women to control our own reproductive choices. He has cosponsored legislation to prohibit Federal funding for health insurance plans that include coverage of abortion. He even opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which removed barriers to women who bring charges of discriminatory wage practices.  Senator Sessions voted against it in 2008 and again in 2009, when it became law over his opposition. Senator Sessions has consistently argued for ``color blind'' enforcement of our Nation's civil rights laws. He contends that racism in the United States has been effectively addressed, and, therefore, diversity programs unfairly discriminate against White  For the same reason, he has voted against legislation to protect the rights and safety of the LGBT community. In 2009, he vehemently opposed the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act, which protects LGBT Americans from hate crimes. In debate on that proposed law, Senator Sessions said:       Today I am not sure women or people with different sexual      orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don't      see it.  Well, Senator Sessions, if you talked to the members of the gay and lesbian community, as I have, if you would talk to women across this country who have faced discrimination in employment practices, who have faced discrimination before the Affordable Care Act, in terms of our health insurance, who have faced discrimination in terms of getting justice in cases of violence against women, you would understand that we need to make sure that the laws protect women and minorities.  In 2013, Senator Sessions voted against a measure to prohibit discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation or gender identity. He also voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt2-PgS825.txt,1901,1300,2017.0,6.0,March

7935,topic-id,457,"So in 2013, as I was saying, Senator Sessions voted against a measure to prohibit discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And similarly, he voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Finally, Senator Sessions' views on immigration are just outside the mainstream. Most Americans want fair, humane treatment for would-be immigrants to the United States, as well as for undocumented immigrants who are already here.  Senator Sessions has amply demonstrated that he does not agree with this view. Since he came to the Senate, he has been a leading opponent of bipartisan immigration reform efforts. In 2007 and again in 2013, he was instrumental in defeating immigration reform proposals that had widespread support in Congress and the country.  More recently, he has been a key adviser to Candidate Trump and now President Trump on immigration policies, encouraging extreme positions such as a ban on Muslim immigration and harsh treatment of DREAMers, those undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as young children.  I have also had the opportunity to work with Senator Sessions in trying to renew and extend the special immigrant visa program for those Afghans and Iraqis who helped our men and women in the military as we were fighting conflicts in Iraq and We have heard from multiple members of our military who served that these interpreters and these people from Iraq and Afghanistan who worked with them to make sure that they could help keep them safe have saved lives and have made a difference in that military conflict because of the[[Page S844]]help they provided to our fighting men and women.  Yet Senator Sessions, as we were trying to extend that program, was unwilling to allow us to make sure that we could bring them to the United States, with all of the vetting that goes on to make sure that the people who come here are actually people who helped us. He opposed extending that program to allow all of those folks to come here.  I believe we need an Attorney General who will not only insist on equal enforcement of the laws but who has a passion for pursuing justice and fairness for all Americans, as well as for those who want to visit or who want to immigrate to the United In my view, Senator Sessions has failed to demonstrate that commitment.  Indeed, I worry that as Attorney General, Senator Sessions would affirm and encourage Trump's most troubling tendencies, especially with regard to minorities, to women, to immigrants, and to the LGBTQ community. I believe Senator Sessions is the wrong person for the critically important post of U.Attorney I intend to vote against his confirmation.

I know we have several people waiting to speak, but I wanted to respond to my colleague from South Dakota because I think for Senator Thune to come to the floor and castigate Democrats for holding up Judge Gorsuch, who has just been nominated, and for suggesting we are going to filibuster, the fact is, throughout most of last year, we saw the Republican majority in this body hold up the nominee Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee.  For the first time in history, this body refused to hold a hearing on a nominee for the Supreme Court, refused to give an up-or-down vote, and to suggest that we should not get a fair hearing on the nominee to the Supreme Court--Judge Gorsuch--I think is just not someone who is going to be good for the American people.  Unlike the Republican majority, I haven't heard any Democrats saying: We don't think that Judge Gorsuch should get a hearing or that he should get an up-or-down vote. Everybody I have talked to agrees he should get a hearing and an up-or-down vote.  As for the time that it is taking us to review the nominees of this administration, the fact is, the Trump administration was delayed in putting forward nominees. They were much later than the previous two We are still waiting for many of those nominees to provide the background information that is required for those positions to have the background checks done, to have the questions that have been put forward to them in hearings answered. So I think we should all work together to move these nominees. That is what I have done on the Small Business Committee as the ranking member, and we have worked very well because that nominee provided all the required information. She had the FBI background check done, and we were able to hold a hearing on her. Well, that is what we expect from every nominee.  So I am disappointed to hear my colleague come down and say that we are not going to give Judge Gorsuch a fair hearing. I think we are going to do that, but we are going to do it in a way that provides information to the American people so we all know where this judge stands and what he thinks about the role on the Supreme  I think rather than name-calling, it would be more effective for us to work together to get this done.

7746,topic-id,474,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would create an exception to this bill for instances of public health risks, including byproducts of hydraulic fracturing, well stimulation, or any water contamination. Fracking, especially in my home State of Florida, is dangerous, and its effects can be far-reaching. Just last week, a State senate committee voted unanimously to ban the practice in our State, and the bill continues to move through.  Pollution can reach our aquifers that provide drinking water to millions. Sometimes concerned citizens must go to court to stop this. Access to justice is a fundamental American right, and we must protect it. Sometimes in Washington, up is down and right is wrong. This, unfortunately, is the case with the so-called Innocent Party Protection                              {time}  1530  This bill is incredibly harmful to those injured by corporate wrongdoers. If someone drinks poisoned water as a result of fracking, well stimulation, or general water contamination, this bill will make it harder for them to get justice for their injuries. By restricting access to State courts, the courts that are closest to the people, this bill would deny justice.  The bill will deny plaintiffs their right to choose a State court forum for their claims and will instead allow defendant companies that negligently pollute water to drag a case out, which will drive up costs and increase burdens for plaintiffs by removing it to Federal court.  Then, once a case is in Federal court, instead of litigating over the merits of the case, the courts will argue over the various requirements that this bill establishes. Placing a higher threshold that a plaintiff must satisfy to get the case sent back to State court is unnecessary and unduly burdensome.  The amendment I am offering would restore access to justice. It would allow people whose water has been contaminated by fracking and related activities to seek damages from corporate wrongdoers.  This amendment isn't just a hypothetical exercise. Here in my hand I hold 18 cases involving fracking. They are 18 cases where fracking led to injury. In 10 of these cases, plaintiffs sued in State court, raising State claims, yet defendants removed the case to Federal court, only to have the Federal court remand the cases back to the State due to lack of diversity jurisdiction.  Thus, I hold here 10 cases where a remand back to State court would be denied under this bill. If this bill had been enacted, I hold here 10 cases that would have been denied justice. Four of these 18 hydraulic fracturing cases are still pending. Will we deny justice for these four cases?

Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Last week, President Trump announced his nomination for the Supreme He made an outstanding choice. Judge Neil Gorsuch has a distinguished resume. He graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and went on to receive a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall scholar.  He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices, Byron White and Anthony He worked in both private practice and at the Justice Department before being nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals where he served with distinction for 10 years. He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist and a gifted writer whose opinions are known for their clarity.  Above all--above all--he is known for his impartiality, for his commitment to following the law wherever it leads, whether he likes the results or not. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, Judge Gorsuch has said more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law. That is a problem.  The job of a judge is to interpret the law, not to write it; to call balls and strikes, not to design the rules of the game. Everyone's rights are put in jeopardy when judges step outside their appointed role and start changing the meaning of the law to suit their personal opinions.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination has been greeted with praise by liberals as well as conservatives. I think one of the biggest reasons for that is that both groups know that Judge Gorsuch can be relied on to judge impartially. Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have seen him up close and in action, both in court and      on the Federal Appellate Rules Committee (where both of us      serve); he brings a sense of fairness and decency to the job      and a temperament that suits the Nation's highest I,      for one, wish it were a Democrat choosing the next justice,      but since that is not to be, one basic criterion should be      paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up for the      rule of law and say no to a President or Congress that strays      beyond the Constitution and law?  I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.       His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial      independence, a record that should give the American people      confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the      President who appointed him.  Again, those are the words of Neal Katyal, formerly an Acting Solicitor General for President  When Judge Gorsuch was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, his nomination sailed through the Both of his home State Senators--one a Republican and one a Democrat--supported his nomination, and he was confirmed by a unanimous vote.  Then-Senator Obama could have objected to the nomination. He didn't. Senator Schumer could have objected to the nomination. He didn't. Then-Senators Biden or Clinton or Kennedy could have objected to the nomination, but they didn't. Why? Presumably because they saw what almost everybody sees today; that Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of judge we want on the bench--supremely qualified, thoughtful, fair, and impartial.  Unfortunately, this time around, some Senate Democrats are being less public-spirited. They are upset that their party didn't win the Presidential election so they are threatening to filibuster an eminently qualified nominee, an eminently qualified nominee that a number of them had previously supported.  The Democratic leader recently said:       Now more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is      independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our      democracy, protect fundamental rights, and will stand up to a      President who has already shown a willingness to bend the       That, of course, is precisely the kind of judge that Judge Gorsuch is, as pretty much everyone who knows him--both liberal and conservative--can attest, but leaving that aside, if the Democratic leader really has these concerns about Judge Gorsuch, why did he allow him to receive a unanimous confirmation to the Tenth Circuit?[[Page S845]]Surely, if he had these concerns, it was his obligation to speak up.  No one likes to lose an election, but that is what happens in a democracy, and throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to play ball after you lose is not the most enlightened response. Democrats are not really concerned that Judge Gorsuch is a raving rightwing ideologue. When liberal after liberal attests to his fairness and impartiality, it is pretty hard to pretend that he is anything but an excellent pick for the Supreme Democrats just don't want to confirm him because they are mad that President Trump is the one who nominated him.  Well, it is time for them to get over that. It is one thing to oppose the President when he does something they believe truly endangers our country; it is another thing entirely for them to oppose this outstandingly well-qualified nominee because they are still upset about the election.  Republicans lost the Presidential elections in 2008 and 2012, but we allowed up-or-down votes when President Obama nominated Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Had this election gone the other way, we were prepared to consider a Hillary Clinton nominee.  It is time for Democrats to stop threatening obstruction and to get down to the business of considering Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Republicans, in cahoots with the gun lobby and with trophy hunters, want to eliminate a rule that currently prohibits hunters from using brutal means to kill our majestic animals in Alaska's 16 wildlife refuges.  This rule prevents snaring and trapping bears, including cubs, hunting wolves in their dens, and shooting bears from helicopters, among other methods.  Now, those opposed to the rule say that it hurts Alaska's economy, but there is no evidence of that. In fact, big game hunting represents only 2 percent of wildlife-related recreation on our national wildlife refuges.

Many States have exercised their discretion to direct title X funding to community health centers and family health clinics that do not provide abortions and withhold funding from abortion providers like Planned  It is just common sense that States know the needs of their people and their communities better than Washington bureaucrats do. The States should be able to decide how these Federal funds are distributed.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration disagreed, so they issued a last-minute regulation in their final days in office that would force States to distribute funding to abortion providers. Their rule would take away States' abilities to direct title X funds to providers that offer comprehensive care but do not participate in abortion. It would force States to enable the flow of funds to Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion industry. I think it is reprehensible.  Now Congress has the opportunity to right this wrong and undo the massive overreach. We are taking action to defend taxpayers and defend life by using the Congressional Review Act to overturn this rule. Overturning this rule won't reduce funding for women's health care.

This legislation gives certain designated congressional office caseworkers access to veterans' electronic disability claim records at the Veterans Benefits Administration, or It has broad support in this House, both Democrat and  This bill would allow designated congressional employees to have read-only access to the Veterans Benefits Administration database to look at veterans' records. Congressional staff would not be able to add or remove anything from a record, but simply check on the status of a veteran's claim and check that evidence and documentation are submitted. The reason this is so important is that a veteran will, at times, wait months, only to be told a piece of document has been missing that could have been added months before. It makes sense. It tracks the system. It ensures that the veteran is getting the fastest, best possible claim adjudication.  The purpose is to provide that faster status and let them know. There are privacy safeguards in the bill, which reinforce the necessity for getting prior consent from the veteran. Also, the bill clearly requires that congressional employees designated for this access must be full-time employees who provide constituent services.  Veterans service organizations have suggested that the VA should put a tracking system in place to ensure that these employees are only assisting constituents from their congressional district, and that congressional staff be held accountable if found to abuse any aspect of this new and unprecedented authority. I support that suggestion.  In my district, county veterans service organizations have also asked to have read-only access to veterans' records so they can assist veterans. I wish to work with Chairman Roe to examine whether that might be something that could be included down the road.  There is broad bipartisan support for giving congressional staff access to veterans' records so they can help veterans navigate a complex claims system.

I hope there are at least enough Senators here who understand that America is careening over a constitutional cliff and that all of us, regardless of political party, need an Attorney General who can be relied on to enforce the laws fairly and fight back against lawless overreach by an out-of-control  On January 27, the world turned upside down for tens of thousands of people directly affected by President Trump's Executive order turning America's back on refugees around the world and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.  Last week, I recalled many of their stories. I spoke about students and professors, about mothers and children, about friends and neighbors, real people who were turned away, detained, or deported based solely on their religion or the simple fact that they were fleeing war. We all breathed a sigh of relief when a court temporarily halted that order, but we know the fight continues to permanently overturn this unlawful, unconstitutional, and deeply immoral Executive order.  That isn't all that happened last week. Last week, the Acting Attorney General of the United States refused to[[Page S851]]defend President Trump's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive order so President Trump fired her. That is right, the President of the United States fired the Nation's top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an unlawful, unconstitutional, and deeply immoral order.  Last week, after days of slow-walking or ignoring judicial decisions, President Trump went on the attack. He raged against the judge who temporarily halted his order, calling him a so-called judge and questioning his authority to act. That is right. The President of the United States attacked the legal authority of an individual district court judge, lawfully appointed by George Bush and confirmed unanimously by the Senate, to pass judgment on Trump's Executive orders.  These are dangerous times. At times like this, it is more important than ever that the Attorney General of the United States has the guts, the independence, and the good moral judgment to stand up to the President when he seeks to violate the Constitution and ignore the law.  At his confirmation hearing last month, Senator Sessions claimed to be that person. I have to say, I wish it were true. I really do. I wish the President's campaign had been different. I wish his actions now were different. I wish we could give his nominees the benefit of the doubt, but I will not ignore the real world, as unpleasant as it is, and neither can anyone in this  In the real world, Senator Sessions obviously isn't going to stand up to the President's campaign of bigotry. How could he? In the real world, Senator Sessions is one of the principal architects of that campaign.  Senator Sessions made a special name for himself for being a particularly vitriolic opponent of commonsense immigration policies. He railed against legal immigrants. He attacked cities and States that focus on keeping their communities safe instead of serving as a national deportation force. He called Islam a toxic ideology and a threat to our Despite the plain language of the Constitution, Senator Sessions doesn't think that children born in the United States should automatically become citizens. He wants to round up and deport DREAMers, who were brought to the United States as kids. Does that all sound familiar? Well, it should because Senator Sessions was an early and energetic supporter of then-candidate Donald Trump, and the Senator played a key role in shaping what has become the most extreme, most divisive, and most dangerous immigration policies of any President in decades.  Senator Sessions' radical views are not limited to immigration. On issue after issue, Senator Sessions has displayed open hostility to the rights of all  He has made derogatory and racist comments that should have no place in our justice system.  As a Federal prosecutor, he got involved in a voting rights case against those who were trying to help American citizens who were lawfully registered to vote. Yes, that is right--he brought a case against civil rights workers who helped African-American voters submit absentee ballots.  While serving as Alabama's attorney general, he reportedly made numerous racist comments, including saying he thought the KKK was OK until he learned that they smoked weed.  He called a White attorney representing Black clients in a civil rights case a disgrace to his race.  He claimed that the NAACP and the ACLU were un- In a speech in 2006, he said: ``Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming here because they have a provable skill that would benefit us and that would indicate their likely success in our society.'' According to Sessions, Dominicans come to the United States by engaging in fraud.  Senator Sessions is also extraordinarily hostile to any effort to root out discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. According to Senator Sessions, marriage equality is a threat to the American culture.  Roe v. Wade is constitutionally unsound.  Employers should be able to fire you because they don't like whom you love.  He voted against equal pay for equal work.  He even voted against the Violence Against Women  It doesn't stop there. On crime, Senator Sessions' solution is to lock up people for even minor, low-level offenses; throw away the key. He has advocated for expanding prisons for youth, aggressively prosecuting marijuana offenses, and eliminating parole or reduced prison time for good behavior.  During the 2016 Presidential campaign, he heaped praise on then-candidate Donald Trump for having once taken out a racially tinged full-page newspaper ad advocating for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, the Black and Latino teenagers who were falsely accused and convicted of raping a young woman in New York's Central  Senator Sessions is not a plain-old conservative Senator Sessions occupies a place way out at the radical fringe of his party, regularly taking positions that are far more extreme than his other Republican colleagues. For example, when Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a commonsense, bipartisan immigration bill, Senator Sessions worked overtime to make sure the bill did not make it through the When Republicans and Democrats came together to propose legislation to reform our broken Federal criminal sentencing laws, Senator Sessions was part of the handful of Senators who ensured that the bill would not get a vote here in the  Senator Sessions has been a public figure for decades. None of this--none of this is secret, and much of it is completely indefensible, but President Trump wants this man. So the same Republican Senators who once fought Senator Sessions tooth and nail have now launched a massive PR campaign to try to repair his public image.  That case against the civil rights workers helping Blacks in Alabama to vote? Hey, you go it all wrong. He was just trying to help out other African Americans who were concerned about voting irregularities.  His vote against the Violence Against Women Act? His position on LGBTQ rights? His opposition to a woman's right to choose? Hey, don't worry about it. He says he will vigorously enforce the law once he becomes Attorney Give me a break.  The law enforcement power of the United States of America is an awesome thing. In the right hands, in steady and impartial hands, it can be used to defend all of us, to defend our laws, to defend our In the wrong hands, it can be used to bully and intimidate the defenseless, to destroy lives, to undermine American democracy itself.  Senator Sessions is not misunderstood. Senator Sessions has never been misunderstood. For decades, it has been absolutely clear where he stands. Now the time is here for every Senator to make absolutely clear where they stand as well.  Let's be clear. Winning a seat in the U.Senate does not exempt a Cabinet nominee from the close scrutiny that all nominees to lead our government deserve. It does not change the Senate's constitutional responsibility to examine a nominee to make certain that nominee will faithfully and fairly enforce the laws of the United States of It does not relieve the Senate of its duty to reject nominees whose records demonstrate that they will not stand up for American values and constitutional principles.  When it comes to the Senate confirming someone to be Attorney General--the highest law enforcement officer in this country--we are all personally responsible for that choice. To put Senator Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is an insult to African To put Senator Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is a direct threat to immigrants. To put Senator Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is a deliberate affront to every LGBTQ person. To put Senator Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is an affront to women.  I ask again, where are the Senators who will say no to Senator Sessions as Attorney General of the United States? Thirty years ago, a Republican-controlled Senate took the extraordinary step of rejecting Senator Sessions' nomination to serve as a Federal judge.[[Page S852]]They had the courage to stand up for the principles that transcend party affiliation--fairness, equality, justice for all. Their rejection sent a message that that kind of dangerous, toxic hatred has no place in our courts. I urge them again today to exert that moral leadership and to send a message that this kind of dangerous, toxic hatred has no place in our Justice I urge them to set aside politics and do what they know is right.  I wish to read two statements that really stood out to me as I was reviewing Senator Sessions' record on civil rights. One is the powerful speech that the late Senator from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy, gave in 1986, and the other is a very moving letter from Coretta Scott King, a letter she wrote to the Judiciary Committee that same year.  I want to start with what Senator Kennedy said. He said:       The confirmation of nominees for lifetime appointments to      the Federal judiciary is one of the most important      responsibilities of the Senate mandated by the U.     Constitution, and the examination by the Senate of a      nominee's fitness to serve as a Federal judge is the last      opportunity to determine whether the candidate possesses the      education, experience, skills, integrity, and, most      importantly, the commitment to equal justice under law, which      are essential attributes of a Federal judge.       Once confirmed, a Federal judge literally has life and      death authority over citizens that appear before him, with      limited review of his decisions. Our Federal judiciary is the      guardian of the rights and liberties guaranteed to all of us      by the U.Constitution, and the decisions of fellow judges      are constantly shaping and reshaping those rights and      liberties.       This committee has a duty to our citizens to carefully      examine the qualifications of nominees for the Federal bench      and to give our approval only to those who have demonstrated      a personal commitment to the principle of equality for all      Americans and a sensitivity to the long history of inequality      which we are still struggling to overcome.  Mr.Sessions, as a U.attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, comes to this committee with a record which regrettably includes presiding over the now-infamous so-called Perry County voting fraud prosecutions. In the Perry County case, the government indicted three well-known and highly respected Black civil rights activists on charges of voter fraud and assisting elderly Black voters to vote by absentee ballot. But for the efforts of the defendants 20 years ago, these Black citizens would not have been allowed to vote. All three of the defendants were acquitted on all charges in the indictments, and some of the elderly Blacks have responded to their experiences during the prosecution, vowing never to vote again. Mr.Sessions' role in that case alone should bar him from serving on the Federal bench.  There is more--much more. We just received a sworn statement from a Justice Department attorney I know--which will be the subject of a good deal of questioning during the course of this hearing--who has worked on civil rights cases with Mr.Sessions over the period Sessions was U.attorney. Mr.Huber has stated to the committee investigators that Mr.Sessions on more than one occasion has characterized the NAACP and the ACLU as un-American, Communist-inspired organizations. Mr.Huber reports that Mr.Sessions said that these organizations did more harm than good when they were trying to force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them. Mr.Huber also stated that Mr.Sessions suggested that a prominent White civil rights lawyer who litigated voting rights cases was a disgrace to his race for doing it. Mr.Sessions is a throwback to a shameful era which I know both Black and White Americans thought was in our past.  It is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.attorney, let alone a U.Federal judge.  ``He is, I believe, a disgrace to the Justice Department, and he should withdraw his nomination and resign his position.'' Those were the words of Senator Ted Kennedy, and I will stand with Senator Kennedy, and, like he did, I will cast my vote against the nomination of Senator  Coretta Scott King also wrote to the Judiciary Committee about the Sessions nomination in 1986. This is what she wrote:       Mr.Chairman and members of the Committee:       Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to express my      strong opposition to the nomination of Jefferson Sessions for      a federal district judgeship for the Southern District of      My longstanding commitment, which I shared with my      husband, Martin, to protect and enhance the rights of Black      Americans, rights which include equal access to the      democratic process, compels me to testify today.       Civil rights leaders, including my husband and Albert      Turner, have fought long and hard to achieve free and      unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr.Sessions has used      the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of      the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to      serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to      happen. Mr.Sessions' conduct as U.Attorney, from his      politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his      indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws,      indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and      judgment to be a federal judge.       The Voting Rights Act was, and still is, vitally important      to the future of democracy in the United I was      privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to      Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965.

7998,topic-id,3870,"Madam President, the Attorney General of the United States holds a vital and also somewhat unique position in the Federal The Attorney General of the United States is tasked with[[Page S862]]significant responsibilities that must be executed independently, sometimes even in defiance of the White House's wishes and interests.  The Attorney General of the United States is tasked with enforcing our laws fairly, justly, and evenhandedly, as well as with protecting the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans of all persuasions, of all backgrounds. The Attorney General of the United States does not work for the President so much as for the people and does not serve the administration so much as the law.  I have served in the U.Department of I have felt its esprit de corps, its pride. That pride is founded on a firm sense of the Department's willingness to stand on what is right, even against the wishes of the White One fine example of this was Attorney General Ashcroft challenging and refusing to accede to the wishes of the White House on the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping of The Department of Justice is well aware of the importance of its independence.  A successful Attorney General must be stalwart in protecting the Department from political meddling by the administration or by We need only look back to Attorney General Gonzales's resignation to recall how badly things turn out when an Attorney General yields to political pressure.  An Attorney General also makes policy decisions about where and how to direct the Department's $27 billion budget and when and how to advise Congress to recommend new laws and modify existing policies. These are policy choices an Attorney General makes. It is no answer to questions about those policy choices to say: I will follow the law. That doesn't apply in this arena of funding decisions and legislative recommendations that are policy choices not dictated by law. Those policy choices can have a profound effect on individuals, on communities, and on the fabric of our  Americans should be able to trust that their Attorney General will not only enforce the laws with integrity and impartiality but stand up for Americans of all stripes and fight on behalf of their rights. That is the prism through which I evaluate Senator Sessions' nomination.  I have known Senator Sessions for a decade and have enjoyed working with him on a number of pieces of legislation. However, the standard by which I evaluate an Attorney General nominee is whether Rhode Islanders will trust that in the tough clinches, he will always be independent and always fair.  I have reviewed Senator Sessions' career as an attorney and as a Senator, as well as his testimony before the Judiciary I have reflected on my own duties and experience as my State's attorney general and as the U.attorney in Rhode I have also served as an attorney in our State attorney general's office.  By the way, the attorney general in Rhode Island has full prosecutive authority. Many States have a division in which the attorney general has a narrow ambit of authority and district attorneys do the bulk of the criminal prosecution--not so in Rhode  I have also had the occasion to listen closely to very strong and honest, serious concerns from Rhode Islanders who have made it plain to me that they fear what Senator Sessions would do as head of the Justice For every constituent of mine who has expressed support of his nomination, 15 have expressed opposition.  Senator Sessions has fought against fixing our immigration system, opposing as the leading opponent of bipartisan legislation which, had it passed, would have spared us much of the current debate over walls      and immigration.  Senator Sessions fought against our bipartisan criminal justice and sentencing reform bill.  Senator Sessions opposed reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act--a bill which is vitally important to the Rhode Island Department of Attorney General and to the anti-domestic violence groups around Rhode  Senator Sessions' record on support of gay and lesbian Americans has alarmed many Rhode Public statements and confirmation testimony by Senator Sessions suggest that he brings a religious preference to the Department and that what he calls secular attorneys would be, to him, suspect compared to Christian attorneys. That distinction between a secular attorney and a religious attorney is one that runs counter to very solid principles upon which my State was founded. Roger Williams brought to us freedom of conscience.  Senator Sessions has called Breitbart News a bright spot. I must disagree. Breitbart News is not, to me, a bright spot. Breitbart has published baseless and inflammatory articles with titles like ``Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.''  In fairness, I should disclose that Senator Sessions' nomination carries an additional burden with me as the nominee of this President and this White The need for an independent Attorney General has rarely, if ever, been greater.  On the campaign trail, the American people witnessed Donald Trump glorify sexual misconduct, mock a disabled reporter, and make disparaging remarks about immigrants and minorities. We all witnessed chants at Trump rallies of ``lock her up.'' At his confirmation hearings, Senator Sessions excused these as ``humorously done.'' In mass rallies that also featured people getting beaten and the press caged and vilified, this didn't seem very humorous to many I think Americans know that the good guys in the movie are not the ones in the mob; the good guy is the lawman who stands on the jailhouse porch and sends the mob home. To me, that ``lock her up'' chant was un-I believe that across the country it made honest prosecutors' stomachs turn.  Not surprisingly, many Americans are fearful of what the Trump administration will mean for them, for their families, and for their country.  The problems with this President did not end with the campaign. President Trump and his family have brought more conflicts of interest to the White House than all other modern Presidents and families combined. The proposed Trump domestic Cabinet is an unprecedented swamp of conflicts of interest, failures of disclosure and divestment, and dark money secrets. We have not even been permitted, in the course of our nomination advice-and-consent process, to explore the full depth of that unprecedented swamp because the dark money operations of nominees have been kept from us. In one case, thousands of emails are still covered up. The Trump White House traffics in alternative facts, operates vindictively, and is a haven for special interest influence. None of this is good. All of this suggests that there will be more or less constant occasion for investigation and even prosecution of this administration.  Independence is at a premium. Nothing could have made this more clear than the first disagreement between the Trump White House and the Department of Justice, whose outcome was that the Acting Attorney General--a woman with 30 years' experience in the Department, a career prosecutor, former assistant U.attorney, former U.attorney, and someone recognized for her leadership throughout the Department--was summarily fired.  This is also not a good sign. In recent history, Attorneys General Gonzales, Meese, and Mitchell were politically close to their Presidents, and the Gonzales, Meese, and Mitchell tenures did not end well.  Attorney General Mitchell worked for President They met when their New York law firms merged in the early 1970s, and they became law partners. John Mitchell was the campaign manager for Nixon's 1968 Presidential campaign. There were signs that things weren't quite right because when Nixon nominated Mitchell to be his Attorney General, he appealed directly to FBI Director Hoover not to conduct the usual background check. Mitchell ultimately resigned as Attorney General in order to run President Nixon's reelection campaign. So the political link between Mitchell and Nixon was very close, and sure enough, scandal ensued. Attorney General Mitchell turned out to be a central figure of the Watergate scandal. As the chairman of the reelection committee, the famous CREEP, Mitchell was responsible for appointing Gordon Liddy and approving the dirty tricks program while still Attorney  That dirty tricks program ultimately included breaking into national Democratic headquarters in the Watergate.[[Page S863]]The upshot of this was that Mitchell was charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and three counts of perjury. He was convicted on all counts, and he served 19 months in prison.  Attorney General Edwin Meese was also very close to President Meese joined the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign as Chief of He ran the day-to-day campaign operations and was the senior issues adviser. After the election, Edwin Meese was given the job of leading the Reagan transition, and once in office, Reagan appointed Meese as Counselor to the According to press accounts at the time, Meese was known as someone who ``has known the President so long and so well, he has become almost an alter ego of Ronald Reagan.'' That was the political background between Meese and President  Again, it did not end well. Meese came under scrutiny for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. The congressional committee that reported on the Iran-Contra scandal in November 1987 determined that Meese had failed to take appropriate steps to prevent members of the administration from destroying critical evidence. An independent counsel named Lawrence Walsh finished a report in 1993 that stated that Meese had made a false statement when he said Reagan had not known about the 1985 Iran-Contra deal. Iran-Contra was not the only controversy that plagued Attorney General A company called Wedtech Corporation was seeking Department of Defense contracts in the early 1980s. The company hired Meese's former law school classmate and his personal attorney, a lawyer named Robert Wallach, to lobby the Reagan administration on its behalf. Attorney General Meese helped Wedtech at Wallach's urging get a special hearing on a $32 million Army engine contract, although the Army considered the company unqualified. Well, the contract was awarded to Wedtech, and then one of Meese's top deputies went to work for  The Federal criminal investigation that resulted led to the conviction of Robert Wallach, the former law school classmate and personal attorney of Meese, for whom he had set up the meetings with the government.  Independent counsel James McKay investigated the Wedtech contract, including investigating allegations of misconduct by While Meese was never convicted, he resigned following the issuance of the independent counsel's 800-page report.  Third is Attorney General Attorney General Gonzales was close to then-Governor Bush in He was his general counsel. When Governor Bush became President Bush, Gonzales came to Washington to serve as White House He was appointed Attorney General in 2005. During his tenure at the Department of Justice, there were multiple investigations, many of which played out before the Senate Judiciary Committee, involving the Warrantless Wiretapping Program, the U.attorney's scandal, and inquiries into the Department's management of the torture program legal opinions.  Ultimately, Members of both Houses of Congress called for Attorney General Gonzales's resignation--or demanded that he be fired by the President--and Attorney General Gonzales resigned.  There is a track record here of Attorneys General who are politically close to a President coming into harm's way and doing poorly in the One particular office that is vulnerable to this kind of undue proximity, and failure of independence, is a body in the Department of Justice called the Office of Legal Jack Goldsmith, a former head of the Office of Legal Counsel--and a Republican, by the way--testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that ``more than any other institution inside the executive branch, OLC is supposed to provide detached, apolitical legal advice.'' And it has an honorable tradition of providing such advice to a remarkable degree, but under the Bush administration, the OLC departed from that tradition. It came up in a number of ways. The first was during our investigation into President Bush's Warrantless Wiretapping  When Office of Legal Counsel memos supporting the program came to light, I plowed through a fat stack of those classified opinions that were held in secret over at the White House and pressed to have some of the statements declassified. Here are some of the statements that were declassified found in those OLC opinions:       An Executive order cannot limit a There is no      constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new      Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms      of a previous Executive order.  So this means a President could issue an Executive order, have it published in the Federal Register, put it forward as the policy of the administration--a direction to all the attorneys in the administration--and then secretly depart from it without ever changing what the public is told about the policy. A theory like this allows the Federal Register, where these Executive orders are assembled, to become a screen of falsehood, behind which illegal programs can operate in violation of the very Executive order that purports to control the executive branch. That was just one.  Another one I will quote: ``The President exercising his constitutional authority under Article II, can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President's authority under Article II.''  If that sounds a little bit like pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, well, it sounds that way to me, too, and it runs contrary to a fairly basic constitutional principle announced in the famous case of Marbury v. Madison--which every law student knows--which says: ``It is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is.''  A third example--and this is another quote from an OLC opinion: ``The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal [opinions.]''  Well, if that is true, what is the point of a President sending matters over to the Department of Justice for legal review? If the President did it, and it is therefore automatically legal, there would be no function to the Department of Justice accomplishing that legal review.  So in this area of warrantless wiretapping, the Office of Legal Counsel within the Department of Justice came up with what seemed to be quite remarkable theories in the privacy and secrecy of that office, in those classified opinions that are really hard to justify in the broad light of day. That is why independence matters so much. Obviously, the White House wanted those opinions to say what they said, but in the clear light of day, they don't hold up.  Let us move on from the warrantless wiretapping opinions of the Bush Department of Justice to the OLC opinions that the Bush administration used to authorize waterboarding of detainees. Again, I was one of the first Senators to review the OLC opinions, and when I read them, I will say I was quite surprised. I was surprised not just by what they said but by what they didn't say. One thing that was entirely omitted was the history of waterboarding. Waterboarding was used by the Spanish Inquisition, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, by the French-suppressing revolts in Algeria, by the Japanese in World War II, and by military dictatorships in Latin The technique, as we know, ordinarily involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, heels overhead, putting a cloth over his face, and pouring water over the cloth to create the impression of drowning. Senator John McCain, held captive for more than 5 years by the North Vietnamese, said this of waterboarding:       It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture.  American prosecutors and American judges in military tribunals after World War II prosecuted Japanese soldiers for war crimes for torture on the evidence of their waterboarding American prisoners of war. None of that history appeared in the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.  The other major thing the Office of Legal Counsel overlooked was a case involving a Texas sheriff who was prosecuted as a criminal for waterboarding prisoners in 1984. Let's start with the fact that this was a case that was brought by the Department of It was the U.attorney for that district who prosecuted the sheriff. The Department of Justice won the case at trial.  The case went up on appeal to the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the court one level below the U.Supreme In its appellate decision, the U.Court of Appeals for the[[Page S864]]Fifth Circuit described the technique as ``water torture.''  All a legal researcher had to do was to type the words ``water'' and ``torture'' into the legal search engines Lexis or Westlaw, and this case would come up: United States v. You can find it at 744 F2d 1124.  Over and over in that published appellate opinion by the second highest level of court in the Federal judiciary, they described the technique as torture. Yet the Office of Legal Counsel never mentioned this case in their decision.  Ordinarily, what a proper lawyer is supposed to do, if they find adverse precedent--i.e., decisions that appear to come down a different way than the argument the lawyer is making--is they report the decision to the court, and then they try to distinguish it, they try to convince the judge they are before why that case was either wrongly decided or does not apply on the facts of their case. But the Office of Legal Counsel did not offer any effort to distinguish the Fifth Circuit decision; it simply pretended it did not exist or it never found it. It is hard to know which is worse.  At sentencing in the Lee case, the district judge admonished the former sheriff who had been found guilty of waterboarding: ``The operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country.''  Well, it is also pretty embarrassing when what is supposed to be the institution inside the executive branch that is supposed to provide detached, apolitical legal advice in an honorable tradition of providing such advice, to a remarkable degree, to quote Professor Goldsmith, misses a case so clearly on point.  That was not the only OLC error. In addition to the warrantless wiretapping statements, in addition to the Office of Legal Counsel opinions on waterboarding, they undertook a review of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is something called an exclusivity provision. It says this: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ``shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and the interception of domestic wire, oral and electronic communications may be conducted.'' Shall be the exclusive means. Seems pretty clear. But the Office of Legal Counsel said about that language--I quote them here: Unless Congress made a clear statement in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that it sought to restrict Presidential authority to conduct wireless searches in the national security area, which it has not, then the statute must be construed to avoid such a reading--which it has not.  Congress said that this shall be the exclusive means. If the OLC was not happy reading the language of the statute, they could go to a court where this language had already been construed. The decision was called United States v. Andonian, and the judge in that case ruled that this language, the exclusivity clause--I am quoting the court's decision--``reveals that Congress intended to sew up the perceived loopholes through which the President had been able to avoid the warrant requirement.''  The exclusivity clause makes it impossible for the President to opt out of the legislative scheme by retreating to his inherent executive sovereignty over foreign affairs. The exclusivity clause assures that the President cannot avoid Congress's limitations by resorting to inherent powers.  In the face of that case law, the Office of Legal Counsel held that Congress had not said what it said and this was not exclusive language, even though a court had said so.  The reason I share those three stories is because it really matters in important issues when the Department of Justice has the capability and the courage to stand up to the It really matters when they get it wrong. It really matters when they say things that simply are not correct or legally sound in order to support a warrantless wiretapping program. It really matters when they don't find the case on point to evaluate whether waterboarding is torture. It really matters when they go around a clear congressional statute which a judge has said closes the door to going around that statute by simply saying privately: Well, that door is not actually closed. It matters.  I have insufficient confidence that as Attorney General, Senator Sessions will be able to stand up to the kind of pressure we can expect this White House to bring. We know that this White House operates vindictively and likes to push people around.  We found out recently that Mr.Bannon went running over to see General Kelly to tell him to undo the green card waiver of the Muslim ban. Thankfully General Kelly refused and stuck by his duty. But this is the kind of White House we have, where they try to push people around to do the wrong thing.  They are so contemptuous of authority outside their own that they are willing to attack a Federal judge who disagrees with them, calling him a ``so-called judge.'' They are willing to fire an Acting Attorney General who disagrees with them, firing her summarily and accusing her of betrayal. The pressure this White House can be expected to bring on the Department of Justice to conform itself not to the law but to the political demands of the President is going to be intense.  Moreover, the conflicts of interest that crawl through this White House and that crawl over this swamp Cabinet offer every reasonable cause to believe that there will have to be investigations and prosecutions into this administration.  That combination of a target-rich environment in this administration for investigation and prosecution with a vindictive White House that does not hesitate to try to bully officials into conformity calls for the highest degree of independence. I do not feel Senator Sessions makes that standard. He was too close to the President during the political race. He has not stood up against any of those excesses I have mentioned since then. It is with regret that I must say I will not be able to vote to confirm him.  One of the reasons I became a lawyer was because of ``To Kill a Mocking Bird.'' As a kid, I just loved Atticus He is great in the movie. He is even better in the book. Some of the things that Atticus Finch says about the law and about human nature are so brave and so profound that from the first time I read that book, boy, I would love to have been Atticus I would love to have had the chance to stand in the breach when everyone was against you and stick up for doing something that was right. Gosh, that felt so great.  Like the scene in many movies, the hero is not a part of the mob, not carrying a torch toward the jailhouse; the hero is the lonely lawman who sits on the porch and won't let the mob in. That is what I think we are going to need in our next Attorney  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

With access to the system files, our office would have had a clearer picture of the timeline of events and been able to direct and streamline our inquiry.
