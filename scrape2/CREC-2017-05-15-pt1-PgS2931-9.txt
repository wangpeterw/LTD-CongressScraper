                       TRIBUTE TO COLYER WOOLSTON

 Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Colyer Woolston for his hard 
work as an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize his efforts 
and contributions to my office as well as to the State of Wyoming.

[[Page S2932]]

  Colyer is a native of Sheridan, WY, and a graduate of Hamilton 
College. He studied environmental studies and geosciences, as well as 
comparative literature. He has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which 
has made him an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of his work 
is reflected in his great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Colyer for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
