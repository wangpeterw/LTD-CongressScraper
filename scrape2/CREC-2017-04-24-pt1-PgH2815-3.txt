                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Vincent DeRosa, Francis Xavier, Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  God and Lord of all, we acknowledge You to be the shepherd of our 
national good. Exercise over our people all Your benign sovereignty.
  We renew our dedication to the rights and justice with which You have 
endowed us and recommit ourselves in leading truly virtuous lives. In a 
particular manner, we undertake to bring about the triumph of the 
common good, especially for the neediest among us, so far as we are 
able.
  Divine Lord, we offer You our humble actions to obtain the peace and 
prosperity of all our fellow citizens. In this way, may the reign of 
Your peace be firmly established in all hearts.
  Amen.
