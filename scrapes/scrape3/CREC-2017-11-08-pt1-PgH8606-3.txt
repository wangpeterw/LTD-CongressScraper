                      OPPOSING REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
Republican tax plan. As I have said many times before, this plan gives 
tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations, over the needs of American 
families, while adding a predicted $2.1 trillion to the national debt 
over the next decade.
  Particularly devastating for New Jersey is the partial elimination of 
the State and local tax deduction. More than 25 percent of New 
Jerseyans would face a tax hike over the next decade due to this 
change.
  Per person, New Jersey taxpayers paid $3,478 more in Federal taxes in 
2015 than they received from the government, more than any other State. 
Not only would the bill aggravate this disparity in New Jersey, it 
would also eliminate vital deductions that give relief to those 
burdened with high medical costs, student debt, and unexpected losses 
due to natural disasters.
  Mr. Speaker, I will not support a one-sided plan that harms New 
Jersey and those who are most in need of tax relief.
