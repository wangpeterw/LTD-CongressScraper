                        TRIBUTE TO ADELE GRIFFIN

  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I want to recognize Adele Griffin, a 
longtime Senate staffer in my Jacksonville office, for her years of 
hard work; for me, my staff, and the people of the State of Florida.
  A fifth-generation Floridian, Adele previously worked under Senator 
Mel Martinez and Senator George LeMieux before her time in my office. 
Adele has been a dedicated and diligent leader who took special pride 
in addressing the many issues facing northeast Florida over the years.
  I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Adele 
for all the great work she has done and wish her a happy retirement.
