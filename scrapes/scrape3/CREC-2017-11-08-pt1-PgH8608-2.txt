                  AMERICANS DESERVE A BETTER TAX DEAL

  (Mr. SARBANES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Republican tax 
plan, a tax plan that is of, by, and for the wealthy and well 
connected.
  How do we know this?
  Yesterday, a Republican Congressman told a Capitol Hill reporter: 
``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me 
again.' ''
  There you have it, a window into the true motivation for this bill. 
It is a massive giveaway to the big donor class. It slashes the 
corporate tax rate, guts the estate tax to benefit millionaires and 
billionaires, and creates a new loophole so the superwealthy can 
disguise their income.
  What is worse, this Republican tax bill would be devastating for 
millions of middle- and lower-income Americans. It attacks the State 
and local tax deduction and the mortgage interest deduction. It 
eliminates tax deductions for medical expenses and student debt. It 
increases the deficit by approximately $1.5 trillion.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve a better deal.
