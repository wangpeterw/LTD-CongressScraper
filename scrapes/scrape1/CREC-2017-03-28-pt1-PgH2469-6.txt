                    KEEP THE CLEAN POWER PLAN INTACT

  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, President Trump today plans to unravel the 
Clean Power Plan that, once implemented, would reduce carbon emissions 
by 870 million tons, the equivalent of 166 million cars.
  Why? False science, false economics.
  Some of the best minds of the 18th century apparently are advising 
President Trump on science matters. This planet is melting. We have had 
the worst wild weather in centuries; the three hottest years on record. 
Let's not deny what is before our very eyes, false economics.
  President Trump apparently believes we have to make a choice: either 
jobs or a clean environment. The exact opposite is true; 8.1 million 
people worldwide work in clean energy. It will be 24 million in 2030. 
Solar jobs in Vermont grew at the fastest pace of any jobs.

[[Page H2470]]

President Trump believes we either have jobs or a clean environment. He 
has it exactly wrong. We have both or we have neither.
  A confident nation faces its problems. It doesn't deny them. Keep the 
Clean Power Plan intact.
