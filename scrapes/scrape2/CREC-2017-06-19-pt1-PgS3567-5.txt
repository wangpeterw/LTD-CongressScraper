                             LONDON ATTACK

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today we are learning about new 
attacks in Europe. I would like to start by offering the Senate's 
condolences to the victims and their families in London. As our allies 
in the United Kingdom develop a better understanding of the nature of 
that attack, let me again reiterate that our commitment to our friends 
in Europe remains very strong. We will continue to stand by you.
