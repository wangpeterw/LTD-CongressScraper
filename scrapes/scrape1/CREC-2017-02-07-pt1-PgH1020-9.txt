                   BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE ACA

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to 
efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act without offering at least an 
equal solution for American families.
  Take, for example, the story of a woman I will call Anne, a 
constituent who contacted my office. At 62 years old, Anne's husband 
lost his job of nearly 30 years. Along with a good portion of their 
income, her family lost the source of their health insurance. Because 
Anne works 29 hours per week, she does not receive healthcare benefits 
through her employer.
  On the ACA marketplace, Anne's family was able to find affordable 
coverage. She says that when the bottom dropped out of her health care, 
the ACA was there.
  She writes: ``My husband, myself, and our daughter in college all 
work and pay taxes. I cannot fathom why our Federal Government wants to 
penalize us by undoing a program that is working. Work to improve the 
ACA. Don't throw the baby out with the bath water.''
  I could not agree more.
  Repeal and run is irresponsible and will hurt real people like Anne. 
We need to build on the foundation of the ACA so more of our families 
have access to quality, affordable health care.
