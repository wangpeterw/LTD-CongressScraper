              200TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLONEL SYLVANUS THAYER

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th 
anniversary of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer entering West Point as the fifth 
superintendent of the United States Military Academy.
  Colonel Thayer served 16 years as superintendent and is remembered as 
the ``Father of the Military Academy.'' He is responsible for 
innovations that evolved the Academy into the world's premier leader 
development institution. His character-based leadership education 
system set new standards that are still expected of all cadets today.
  The current superintendent is General Bob Caslen, who carries on 
Colonel Thayer's traditions and instills the ideals of duty, honor, and 
country in our future leaders.
  To that end, the West Point Class of 2017 just graduated, and I 
congratulate the 936 commissioned 2nd lieutenants of the United States 
Army as they take their place in the long gray line. The class of 2017 
has just begun with 1,230 members beginning their West Point 
experience.
  I thank Colonel Thayer and those who follow him for exhibiting 
courage and developing leaders of character in the defense of our 
country. With that, I say: Beat Navy.
