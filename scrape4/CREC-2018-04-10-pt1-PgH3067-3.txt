                     WELCOMING REVEREND SAM SMUCKER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to welcome 
the guest chaplain to the House floor. He is a leader in our community 
in Pennsylvania's 16th District, as well as my oldest brother.
  Mr. Speaker, five other brothers of ours are in the gallery with us 
here today on what I learned was a very appropriate day, as this is 
National Siblings Day. I am so very pleased to host my brothers, who 
are enjoying the sites here in Washington, D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, we have five sisters as well, but I guess that will be 
another day.
  My oldest brother, Sam, was born into an Amish home and was really 
used by God. Sam leads a congregation called the Worship Center in 
Lancaster County. They have 4,000 members. He also leads a ministers' 
fellowship impacting 100 other fellowships, and has traveled to 40 
countries in missionary endeavors across the world.
  Mr. Speaker, we are proud of Sam. He has had an impact not only on 
our community, but across the world as well, and certainly is a 
spiritual leader for our family, and we welcome him here today.
