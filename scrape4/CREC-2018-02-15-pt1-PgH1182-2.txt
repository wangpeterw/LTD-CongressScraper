    CONGRESS SHOULD REJECT THE DIRTY BUDGET AND INFRASTRUCTURE SCAM

  (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we have a responsibility to 
protect our environment and our public lands for today and for 
tomorrow, and that is why we, Congress, passed clean air and clean 
water laws. That is why we protected our public lands and treasured 
spaces.
  President Trump has a different set of priorities. With his dirty 
budget and his infrastructure scam, President Trump is attacking basic 
environmental safeguards. The Trump budget cuts environmental 
protections and makes it impossible for the EPA to keep American 
families safe and healthy.
  The Trump budget stops essential research on climate change, slashes 
clean energy development, and threatens endangered species. The Trump 
infrastructure scam repeals basic environmental safeguards and sells 
off our public lands to Big Oil. Once again, President Trump is putting 
polluters and their profits first at the expense of America's families 
being healthy.
  Our air, water, and our land should never be partisan issues. 
Congress must reject this dirty budget and infrastructure scam and work 
to protect our environment and not destroy it.
