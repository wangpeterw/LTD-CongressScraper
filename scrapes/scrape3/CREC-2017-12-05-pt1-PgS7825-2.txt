                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we praise You for Your goodness; Your faithful love 
endures forever. You are the protector of Your people.
  Today, recapture the minds of our lawmakers and galvanize their 
wills. May they live blameless lives, doing what is right and speaking 
the truth from sincere hearts. Lord, infuse them with the spirit of 
humility so that they will seek to be guided by Your wisdom. May they 
keep their priorities straight, remembering that You are the only 
constituent they absolutely must please. Help them to make it their 
primary goal to please You in what they think, say, and accomplish.
  We praise You and pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
