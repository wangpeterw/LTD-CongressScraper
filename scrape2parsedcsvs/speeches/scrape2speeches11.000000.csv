8431,topic-id,516,"Mr.Speaker, as a Representative of the great State of Texas, I want to first acknowledge and preface my remarks with the fact that most people that are entering these United States illegally are doing so because they want a better life for their families. That said, it doesn't make it right. As has been said, and I have said it before, we are a nation of immigrants for sure, all of us, but we are also a nation of laws.  When the Federal Government abdicates its responsibility to secure our border and enforce our immigration laws, we not only fail in our sacred duty to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, but we put American lives at risk. 121, that is the number of lives that have been lost from 2010 to 2014, lives that could have been saved if we had the political courage to enforce our immigration laws regarding criminal aliens.  Here is something even more outrageous. Of the over 36,000 criminal aliens released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody over the course of a year, 1,000 of them were reconvicted of another crime.  These avoidable, tragic deaths from violent crimes continue to happen across the country, and many of the criminal aliens who have committed them have found refuge in our Nation's sanctuary cities. These are lawless cities, let's be clear, cities whose actions undermine the basic American tenet that we are a nation of laws, not of men.  Fortunately, we have the opportunity to stop this madness and do the job the American people expect their government to do, their first job, and that is to keep Americans safe.  Passing the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would impose significant penalties on States and cities that refuse to follow Federal immigration laws and cooperate with authorities. Additionally, it would allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to prohibit law-breaking immigrants in DHS custody from being transferred to sanctuary cities.  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act only addresses one part of the problem in this area, a problem that we all know will require further reform; but, nonetheless, this is a good, commonsense law, and it will move our country in the right direction towards safer, stronger communities.  In addition to supporting the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, I have cosponsored the Davis-Oliver Act, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. In addition to holding these cities accountable for harboring criminal aliens, we need to ensure that our State and local law enforcement officials have the authority to actually do their job, and that is enforce all of our Nation's laws.  Together, I believe the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and the Davis-Oliver Act will have a major impact on stopping illegal immigration and deterring lawlessness at the hands of criminal aliens who have repeatedly proven that they will break our laws, harm our citizens, and disrespect this great  Mr.Speaker, let's empower the President and local law enforcement agencies to do their job.

8422,topic-id,378,"Mr.President, in the spirit of the ``Decade of Vision,'' I am pleased to recognize July as Dry Eye Awareness In 2009, while serving in the House of Representatives, I was proud to sponsor the successfully passed 366, which recognized the 40th anniversary of the National Eye Institute and designated 2010-2020 as the ``Decade of Vision.'' This resolution sought to bring awareness to our Nation's challenges in vision health, especially as our population ages and the incidence of chronic diseases that may cause vision impairment grows.  Dry eye is one of these growing vision health challenges that affects more than 30 million people in the United It occurs when the eye does not produce tears properly or they are not of the correct consistency and evaporate too quickly. It can range from discomfort to a painful chronic and progressive condition that leads to blurred vision or even vision loss. Dry eye is one of the most frequent causes of patient visits to eyecare providers. It is a particularly burdensome issue for our brave soldiers who were engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi The Veterans Administration reports that upwards of 70 percent of traumatic brain injury-exposed veterans have dry eye symptoms.  Research supported by the National Institutes of Health and its National Eye Institute has improved our understanding of this condition. Dry eye can have many causes, including environmental exposure, side-effects from medications, eye surgery, eyelid disorders, immune system disorders, contact lens wear, cosmetic use, aesthetic procedures, and an increasingly common cause: staring at computer or video screens for too long without blinking, which may have a disproportionate impact on our younger generations.  I want to recognize an important educational opportunity during Dry Eye Awareness Month this year. The Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society's ``Dry Eye Workshop II Report'' will be published in ``The Ocular Surface Journal,'' updating the definition of dry eye and addressing its greater impact on vision health--the first such reexamination since 2007. Report highlights were presented at a July 12, 2017, congressional briefing, accompanied by a ``Test Your Tears'' screening and presentation of research posters.  The vision community and its coalition partners are uniting to recognize this growing vision health problem, and I stand in support of these awareness and educational efforts.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgS4022.txt,1558,IMPROVING FUSION CENTERS' ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT,2017.0,17.0,July

8245,topic-id,165,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.653, the Federal Intern Protection In fact, it is hard to believe we need this legislation at this point in the 21st century, but we do.  Under current law, Federal employees are protected from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, age, and sex. Unfortunately, interns don't qualify. They have no such protections.  I appreciate the wonderful work of our distinguished ranking member, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, on this important measure. I am not surprised, and neither are my colleagues, that he would pick up on this and see the need for this protection to be extended to young men and women who want maybe to pursue a career or part of their career in the Federal They need these protections like the employees they are working with side by side.

8247,topic-id,259,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, again, I want to laud my friend from Maryland (Mr.Cummings) for his perspicacity in ferreting out this issue. It is a very important one.  The use of internships in the Federal Government is a very underutilized tool when compared to the private sector. Many private sector companies will use internships for recruiting the talent it needs for the future. In many cases, 70 to 80 percent of those who intern for private sector corporations end up being hired because they have a carefully monitored program from orientation and recruitment to the tasks at hand during the pendency of the internship. The Federal Government does no such thing systematically.  At the very beginning, if we are going to use internships as creatively as the private sector to recruit the next generation of Federal employees, since one-third of the current workforce is eligible for retirement over the next several years, we have to follow the lead my friends, Mr.Cummings of Maryland and Mr.Russell of Oklahoma, have just given us, and that is to make sure it is a safe workplace. Otherwise, who would be attracted to it?  This piece of legislation is critical to our making Federal internships a meaningful tool in their recruitment and retention, so long as that workforce is protected by the same norms and same regulations as any Federal employee.  I thank my friend, Mr.Cummings, for bringing this to our attention, and I thank Mr.Russell for his leadership.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

8246,topic-id,415,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his kind words. I thank Mr.Russell also for his very kind words.  The bill before us, the Federal Intern Protection Act, would close a loophole in Federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment with no legal recourse. It is interesting. As I listened to Mr.Connolly, he is absolutely right: it is surprising that they don't already have this protection.  Last year, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing at which we heard testimony about sexual harassment and retaliation in an EPA regional office. During the hearing, both Chairman Chaffetz and I expressed our disgust at the exploitation of these young women and demanded action to prevent this abuse in the future.  Unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or, in this case, sex is not prohibited by Federal law. Under current law, victims rely on the discretion of managers to prevent this behavior, which is something that doesn't always occur.  As one witness testified before our committee: ``Even after finding out about the numerous harassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the harasser a steady diet of young women.''  That is a very sad commentary. As I have often said, we are better than that.  We saw at our hearing that allowing this kind of behavior to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service. What we want to do is encourage young people to come into government service. We want them to come in and do what will feed their souls by making life better for the general population. The last thing we want to do is anything that would cause them to say this is something they don't want to do.  Many interns are willing to work for the Federal Government without receiving any pay. That is the other piece: so many of these young people come looking for experience, looking for opportunity. They simply want a chance to get their foot in the door. We must protect them from this kind of despicable behavior. Our bill will afford Federal interns protections in the same manner and to the same extent as Federal employees.  I want to take this moment to thank the chairman for moving this bill expeditiously through our committee, where it was adopted unanimously, and for bringing it to the floor today.

8224,topic-id,344,"Mr.Speaker, H.2781 is a commonsense solution to a complicated problem. I am proud to sponsor it with my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr.Panetta).  Over the last 10 years, Congress gave veteran and veteran service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses the highest preference to compete for VA contracts. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in the Kingdomware case that this preference applies in all situations, even when VA uses contracts awarded by other agencies. A loophole has emerged in a group of contracts called the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative run by the General Services  Currently, the VA uses the GSA to connect them with suppliers of certain goods and services that they need to purchase. All too often, the GSA is not connecting the VA with enough small businesses that are owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans. The law requires that the VA look for these companies and buy from them when it can, if they are competitive; but when the veteran businesses are not on the GSA list, the VA can't find them or use them.  Because of the loophole, well-qualified veteran-owned companies are being passed over. In some cases, VA disregards the GSA contracts and finds veteran-owned companies elsewhere on their own, but this wastes resources by creating contracts similar to what the GSA already has in place.  This bill simply directs the VA Secretary to determine whether veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are sufficiently represented on the contracts for VA to follow the law. If not, the VA must consult with the GSA to increase the representation on all the contracts and their subcategories. Should this not be possible on a particular contract or subcategory, the VA must stop using it.  I am honored that this bill has earned the support of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the National Veteran Small Business We need to hold the VA accountable to the veterans it serves, including our veteran and service-disabled small business owners.

As a former county executive in Erie County, you had that experience of having to write the check every month to Albany for a program and services that you had no control over. I very much appreciate it.  One of the ironies here is that New York State, with 19 million people, spends more on its Medicaid system than Texas and Florida combined. Those two States have more than double our population, yet we spend more than those two States--Texas and Florida--combined. It is no wonder so many New Yorkers have fled to places like Texas and Florida through the years.

In my 19th Congressional District, every single county has lost population in the last 5 years. School district populations are down 30, 40 percent. Part of the reason is because of a lack of jobs and high property taxes. What we are simply saying is there should be accountability.  When I ran for office last year, I promised the people of my district that I would introduce a measure, because then people would say: how can the Federal Government get involved in this question?  The reason is because the Federal law authorized the States to impose part of their costs on the counties or on the local governments. The fact is that only New York State did it to the degree that New York did. That is why it is going to require us to amend the Federal legislation to preclude New York from doing this.  We are giving Albany 2\1/2\ years to reform their program, to eliminate waste, and to make other priorities in its spending. There is no reason for cuts to hospitals or nursing homes, as Governor Cuomo has alleged falsely. What he needs to do is take full responsibility for this program, as most of the Governors in the 49 other States do, and then we will be able to relieve this burden on our local homeowners.

In the same report, the Comptroller questioned an additional $361 million in transactions that would require agency actions to reduce costs or recover funds.  In the past decade, the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Department of Health and Human Services found 10 specific instances in which New York State received improper Federal Medicaid payments in excess of $50 million, with six of those instances each exceeding over $170 million apiece.

8341,topic-id,1754,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss once again the ongoing effort to reform our Nation's Tax  I have been coming to the floor regularly to talk about this subject for more than 6 years, and, during that time, more and more Americans have recognized the need to fix our broken and outdated tax system. Members of Congress from both parties have similarly acknowledged that, when it comes to our Tax Code, the status quo is untenable.  President Trump has made tax reform one of his top priorities, which is essential. Presidential leadership on tax reform has been sorely lacking in the past. Of course, for some the involvement of the President in this endeavor complicates matters. Indeed, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle are, by all appearances, bound and determined to block the passage of any part of President Trump's agenda even if, in terms of policy, there is common ground and it is good for all Still, I welcome the involvement of the President in this effort and hope that more and more of my colleagues will eventually do the same.  Today I want to take a few minutes to rebut the growing narrative in the media and elsewhere that tax reform is going to be a secretive exercise, involving the input of only a few key players.  True enough, there have been meetings involving the administration, House and Senate leaders, and tax writers in recent weeks, wherein we have been discussing tax reform at a high level in an effort to reach some agreement. However, while this process may result in an agreed upon framework, this will not be the be-all and end-all of tax reform. On the contrary, as chairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee, I am committed to ensuring a robust process in the Senate for developing, considering, and passing any tax reform package. That is how the Senate functions best, and that is what I intend to see happen.  Toward that end, I have been working to involve all of the Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee in this effort. We have a number of great Senators on the committee, many of whom have put in years of work on different areas of the tax system. I think it would be foolish to let that experience and expertise go to waste, especially at this time in our lives. Every Republican on the committee is involved in this process, and I have asked some Senators to focus on particular areas.  For example, I have asked Senators Enzi and Portman to focus on the international tax system. This issue is essential. Our antiquated international tax system leaves American businesses at a decidedly competitive disadvantage, and it is one of the main drivers behind the stream of inversions and foreign takeovers we have seen in recent years. Both of these Senators have put in a lot of time and a lot of work on this issue in developing proposals for a better path forward, and some of that development in the past has occurred with substantive input from our Democratic friends. With both Senators Enzi and Portman working on this issue, I think we can and will see significant progress.  In addition, I have asked Senator Grassley, a former Finance Committee chairman himself and currently chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to take a look at our individual tax system. I think most of us here in Congress--and not just on the Republican side--would like to see a tax reform bill that reduces the tax burden on middle-class individuals and families. I think Senator Grassley and others will put their experience to good use.[[Page S3782]]  Likewise, Senator Thune has quite a bit of experience and expertise when it comes to the business tax system, and he has done a lot of work over the years to reform the estate tax. So I have asked him to provide his thoughts and advice as we work through these issues.  I have asked Senators Heller and Cassidy to work on solutions for energy tax policy. Similarly, I have asked Senator Roberts to find solutions to tax issues relating to agriculture.  There are other issues out there, as well, and over time I intend to enlist the help of other committee members to focus on particular tax issues and provide advice and assistance on crafting suitable reforms.  So, as you can see, the idea that tax reform is going to be a closed-door exercise is absurd, at least as things pertain to the Every Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee is involved in this effort.  Of course, we will need to go beyond the committee as well. There are Members throughout the conference with particular interests and expertise relating to tax policy. Many of my colleagues have introduced bills over the years and have become outspoken advocates on a number of key issues. I want those Members to be involved as well.  Just to be clear, I do not think this process should be limited to just Republican input. I want to see Democrats at the table. I want a bipartisan process that renders a bipartisan result. I think the relevant leaders from the administration have said much the same thing.  I have reached out to my Democratic colleagues on the Finance Committee and invited them to participate. Once again, I do not believe this process has to be limited to the committee. Any Member of the Senate, from either party, should have an opportunity to express his or her views and ideas and have them considered as part of this process.  I am willing to sit down and work with anyone who wants to be a good-faith participant in this endeavor and who wants, ultimately, to see it succeed. After all, we have had years and years of bipartisan efforts, including working groups and reports, to find common ground. Recently, however, we have not been hearing much from our Democratic colleagues and friends when it comes to tax reform.  We have heard some of the usual accusations that Republicans are hell-bent on giving massive tax breaks to the super wealthy and inflicting some harm or another on the middle class--total bullcorn but, nevertheless, a constant theme by those on the other side. It is a constant, annoying theme by those on the other side.  We have also heard some process demands that some have set as preconditions for any real bipartisan tax reform discussions. All too often, those preconditions either reflect a lack of willingness to compromise or outright demands for things that are unrelated to tax reform.  In other words, we have heard our colleagues cite a number of reasons as to why they do not want to work with us on tax reform, and I suspect that, to some degree, this false narrative about secrecy and closed doors on tax reform will be added to the list. But I will say it again: I am willing to work with anyone--Republican or Democrat--in this effort. If anyone doubts my sincerity, I think my record for bipartisanship and compromise should speak for itself.  Long story short, my goal on tax reform is to draft and pass a bill with the broadest possible support and input from all who are interested in helping put our economy on a sustained, higher growth path. To do that, I think we need a vigorous and open debate in the Senate, which, in my view, should include a full process in committee and regular order on the Senate floor. At the end of this process, no one should be able to credibly claim that he was unable to participate or that he did not have enough information about the bill.  So I hope this puts to rest any claims or suppositions that the tax reform process is going to be secretive in nature, because, if I have my way, this process is going to be open, fair, and joint. It will be open, and it will be bipartisan.  The goal of everyone in this body, with respect to tax reform, ought to be to help the American people by providing tax relief to American families, simplifying the tax system, improving our business tax system to allow American businesses to compete in the global economy, and creating stronger growth in the economy, wages, jobs, and opportunity.  I hope more of my colleagues will join me in supporting this important effort. It is important that we work our Tax Code out. It is a mess. It is not working. Too many people feel oppressed by it. A lot of our Members of the Senate do not feel very good about our current Tax I do not feel good about it either. I think we need to get together as people who really want to help this country out and want to do the best for our constituents--whether they are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, or whatever--and do it the right way.  I just hope we can get enough interest on both sides of the floor to be able to do what really needs to be done in this very crucial area, and I intend to see that we do. As chairman of the tax-writing committee, we are going to do it. I just hope that I will have some support from the other side, as well, and that they will dig in and present their viewpoints and give us their ideas and help to mold and modify and work and improve and decide what is great in any tax approach that we take.  This is the greatest country in the world. We have the greatest economy in the world. We have the greatest opportunities in the world, but we can certainly hurt every one of those aspects of our lives if we do not handle the tax reform issue properly and if we do not handle taxes properly. I think it is important that we get together, work together, and get rid of some of the churlish stupidity that occasionally exists around this place and start doing what is best for the United States of America and best for all of our supporters, best for all of our constituents, and best for the world, really, because, if the United States is strong and powerful, the rest of the world will be better off.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2169, the Improving Fusion Centers' Access to Information  In the years since 9/11, Congress and the executive branch have taken many steps to address information shortfalls and information-sharing shortfalls. However, we know that silos remain.  The purpose of H.2169 is to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is truly serving as a State and local information-sharing advocate, as originally intended by the Homeland Security  This bill requires the DHS to regularly review information-sharing efforts with the National Network of Fusion Centers and then work with other Federal agencies to close any identified gaps.  State and local fusion centers have grown in maturity and number during the last 16 years since 9/11. There are now 78 fusion centers within the national network. As the network has matured, fusion centers have established themselves as a critical conduit[[Page H4270]]for sharing terrorism, homeland security, and criminal information with Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial partners. As the threat environment continues to evolve, it is vital they have access to the tools and information systems to stay ahead of threats to the homeland.  Despite existing requirements for DHS to share intelligence and information with State and local entities, I have found that the Department does not regularly assess if fusion centers have access to necessary information or databases held by other Federal agencies. H.2169 addresses this deficiency by requiring the Secretary to conduct outreach to the fusion centers to identify information-sharing gaps and work with the appropriate Federal agencies to address these gaps.  Additionally, the Secretary is required to identify Federal databases and datasets that should be included in the information-sharing environment and coordinate with the appropriate Federal agency to deploy such systems.

As you know, the National      Network of Fusion Centers (NNFC) is a focal point for      analytical collaboration and information sharing on threats      to public safety among federal, local, state, territorial,      and tribal public safety agencies.

These efforts resulted in the establishment of regular air service with a local carrier, promoting economic development and easy access to the area by sportsmen. He enlisted the Maine National Guard to do their summer training session in Princeton, and with the work of hundreds of military personnel with heavy equipment, a new mile-long major access road to the airport from Route 1 was completed in just 2 weeks.  While serving in the town of Dexter, he prepared successful applications to the Community Development Block Grant Program that resulted in the renovation of the entire downtown area by adding new decorative streetlights, improved sidewalks, better drainage, and related road work. This effort revitalized the downtown area and spurred private investment in the Main Street buildings.  In the town of Standish, he worked extensively on the growth management plan, which established a roadmap for future community development.  In the town of Norway, where he has served for the past 28 years, David has worked diligently to ensure that the town stays in sound financial condition, as well as keeping the Main Street economically and culturally vibrant. He instituted a sidewalk building program that has resulted in Norway becoming one of Maine's most walkable communities. Perhaps his crowning achievements were the successful grant application and efforts to save the town's historic opera house. David will be long remembered in all the towns he has served for his commitment to community betterment and his forward-thinking positive management style.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgS2678-2.txt,1724,TRIBUTE TO CONNOR HIGGINS,2017.0,2.0,May

When Ruth Libby's son was in kindergarten, she received a note from his teacher requesting household items such as egg cartons, meat trays, and juice can lids for use in craft projects. Ruth responded to this request in full force and went above and beyond by not only getting supplies to her son's classroom, but also for other classrooms in the school. As time went on, she began receiving, sorting, and stocking products donated by corporations, businesses, and individuals for use by local classrooms. Ruth started by delivering these items to the school, and a few years later, she established a ``storeroom'' in her basement where teachers could come and ``shop'' at their convenience. With financial assistance from the Unum Group and a grant from the State of Maine Department of Education, Ruth was able to create a unique and effective nonprofit organization and relocate to the organization's current 21,000-square-foot warehouse and 7,000-square-foot teacher store in Portland,  Since its inception in 1994, Ruth's Reusable Resources has provided more than $60 million worth of surplus furniture, paper, books, office supplies, and computers to nonprofits and schools. They have also received donated furniture, paper, books, office supplies, and computers from corporations, businesses, and individuals across the State of In turn, Ruth's Reusable Resources allows staff members of participating schools to ``shop'' for supplies at no charge. Ruth, together with a diverse group of hard-working volunteers, ranging from retired teachers, students, current teachers, corporate groups, retirees, court appointed volunteers, civic groups, collegiate ministries, and many more, work to ensure that every Maine student is provided with the necessary supplies to succeed in school.  Ruth's Reusable Resources is a shining example of what can happen when you have determination and a passion to make a difference. Ruth is an outstanding example of a hard-working Mainer who is making a difference in her community and across our She has played an instrumental role in providing resources for classrooms in Maine which has furthered the education of many students.

8314,topic-id,734,"Mr.President, yesterday the Senate adopted the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection This legislation facilitates the process of terminating nonperforming VA employees by eliminating certain due process protections that are currently part of the system. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs says he needs this authority to reform the system. The Senate, by voice vote, honored the request. However, in Alaska, we have a different problem which is not addressed in the legislation, and that problem is filling vacant positions within the The major challenge facing VA leaders in Alaska is recruitment and retention.  The Wasilla community based outpatient clinic, CBOC, serves veterans in the fastest growing community in the The last permanent physician at this CBOC resigned in May 2014, citing ``excessive workload.'' A number of temporary physicians have rotated through since, and some have considered VA employment, but ultimately said no. The fact remains that, for the past 3 years, the VA has not been able to recruit a single physician to permanently staff this CBOC, a facility that, given demand, requires a permanent staff of two--or possibly three--physicians. Wasilla is hardly the most remote place in the Actually, it is one of the least remote. Moreover, it is one of the most desirable places in Alaska to live. For example, Mat-Su Regional Hospital, the community hospital down the road, has no problem retaining medical professionals. Staffed with 160 physicians in 28 specialties, including primary care, it was recently highlighted by Becker's Hospital Review as one of the 150 best places to work in healthcare for 2017. By comparison, the VA has been unable to recruit a single physician to permanently tend to the needs of our veterans in the Mat-Su  That suggests to me that the VA has a second problem. The VA is simply not regarded as an employer of choice among potential recruits. Removing due process protections for VA employees may well exacerbate that problem. Over the past 14 years, I have spent time with a great many VA employees, and the fear that a supervisor may now have greater latitude to target an individual on a trumped up charge because they are seen to be rocking the boat or because they just don't like them is a real one. We have very good management in the Alaska VA healthcare system now, but the faces of managers change with some frequency and with those charges can come wide swings in management philosophies.  At a recent hearing of the MILCON-VA subcommittee, my friend from Florida, Senator Rubio, asked Shulkin, ``In your time at the Veterans Administration, have you ever seen or do you have any evidence of any instance in which supervisors targeted individuals for dismissal because they just don't like them and were going to make something up in order to get rid of them?'' While the official transcript is not yet available, we do have the CQ transcript. That transcript indicates that Shulkin did not directly answer the question. He responded that the VA has seen cases of documented whistleblower retaliation.  But not every employee who faces inequity in the workplace becomes a whistleblower. Some just go out and find a new job which offers better working conditions and in some cases better money than the VA pays.  To his credit, Shulkin went on to say, ``But, I want people to understand, I am not seeking this and I do not support your legislation so that we can willy-nilly fire employees, or allow supervisors to abuse our employees. This allows due process. I believe it's very important that our employees have due process, the right to pre-decisional appeals, and the right to be represented by the union or their attorneys.''  I hope that he is right about how this will work out on the ground, but the VA is a highly decentralized system with a great many seemingly autonomous decisionmakers. In asking for this new authority, Shulkin must accept the responsibility for ensuring that it is not abused and must also accept accountability in the event that it is, but the larger question is whether all of the energy we have put into legislating VA accountability does anything to make the VA a more attractive employer to in-demand healthcare professionals. I would like to see the VA devote as much energy and creativity to addressing this challenge as it has to the issue before us yesterday.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3325.txt,1694,ENSURING VETERAN ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION IN STRATEGIC SOURCING ACT,2017.0,7.0,May
8399,topic-id,2614,"Mr.President, I often come to the floor of the U.Senate to discuss issues of the Since the United States is an Arctic nation, it seems that it is only appropriate to give updates when there have been items and events that are noteworthy in this space.  Several weeks ago, we hosted in Alaska the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting, an event duly of note and an event upon which I would like to spend a few moments this afternoon updating colleagues on all that took place at this ministerial and provide a little bit of a recap of the role of the United States as chairman of the Arctic Council for these past 2 years.  This opportunity today to congratulate those in the State Department, the people of Fairbanks, AK, and the Alaska Arctic Council Host Committee for a successful Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Fairbanks is certainly timely.  I have also come to review the accomplishments and the challenges of the Arctic Council during the recent chairmanship by the United States and I think also to look ahead at what I hope and expect will be our Nation's continued leadership in the  As I mentioned, for the past 2 years now, the United States has been chair of the Arctic This is an international forum for the eight Arctic nations. That includes the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and It also includes six permanent participant organizations that represent the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, as well as dozens of interested observer nations and international organizations.  I think it is important to recognize that while you would understand and assume that the Arctic nations are clearly interested in happenings in the Arctic, the interest in being an official observer as part of the Arctic Council has grown steadily in these recent years as nations around the world are recognizing the opportunities that are presenting themselves in this portion of the globe.  The Arctic Council was established in 1996, and it focuses its work on sustainable development and environmental protection in the When we speak at these council meetings, as Arctic Parliamentarians, we always refer to the Arctic as a zone of peace. It is that way now; we would like to see it remain so.  Back in April of 2015, the United States took over as chair from Canada, and at that time, the United States proposed three thematic areas that we would focus on during this 2-year chairmanship. Those three areas were improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities; Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship; and the third issue area was to address the impacts of climate change.  While there were many who believed that the previous administration focused most of its attention on climate change--sometimes at the expense of the other two areas and most notably the focus on economic and living conditions for the people who live and work and raise their families in the Arctic--I believe we saw a good outcome from this 2-year chairmanship.  I would like to note today and acknowledge the work of Julie Gourley as the U.Senior Arctic Official; the work of Ambassador David Balton as the chair of the Senior Arctic Officials; and ADM Robert Papp, who served as the U.Special Representative for the All three of these individuals served to facilitate the U.chairmanship and worked to increase public awareness and knowledge of the I thank them for that.  I also commend the City of Fairbanks and the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which hosted the ministerial meeting. I think it is important to recognize that most assumed that when the United States hosted the ministerial, it would be in Alaska's largest city. Anchorage certainly has the ability to accommodate just about any conference, anywhere, at any time, but I think it was significant that we chose to host in a city that--while it is not above the Arctic Circle, it is getting pretty close up there.  The people of Fairbanks went all out to embrace our friends from around the world. Their efforts were matched by the tremendous work of the Alaska Arctic Council Host Committee and particularly of Nils Andreassen, who connected the Arctic Council with the host communities during its numerous meetings.  In the past, what we had seen at these Arctic Council meetings was folks would fly into an Arctic location, and more often than not, we would be in a large conference hall, typically with no windows and closed doors, and then everyone would fly out without having any real interaction with the community. They wouldn't have an opportunity to engage with the public, and sometimes it made the work of the Arctic Council a little bit of a mystery.  I think we missed some opportunities to build support for the Arctic Council and its work and also to learn and to hear from those who live in our Arctic[[Page S3181]]communities what matters are of concern to them. The Alaska Host Committee worked to break down that barrier by organizing side events. There were dozens of different side events and receptions that allowed for critical interaction.  The City of Fairbanks and the North Star Borough provided incredible hospitality. They always do that, but I think this time they went above and beyond in rolling out the red carpet to ensure the success of the meeting for all who were involved.  During the U.chairmanship, there were a number of successful activities that I would like to highlight briefly.  First, there was an agreement on enhancing international arctic scientific cooperation. This was signed by all eight Arctic nations at the Fairbanks ministerial. It is now the third legally binding agreement among the Arctic nations. We have already done an agreement on search and rescue and a second one on oil spill preparedness. This is now the third, focusing on scientific cooperation. This new agreement will allow scientists to more freely and assuredly work across political borders to develop scientific knowledge about the  What I think is significant about this particular document is that the process to develop the agreement was co-chaired by the United States and This demonstrates that while our nations clearly have a good number of disagreements and disputes around the world, the Arctic can be that place of cooperation. I think we demonstrated that with this particular scientific cooperation.  Another area of focus was on telecommunication. For the first time, we have assessed telecommunication infrastructure in the For anyone who has been there or who has been to any very remote location, you know well the importance of dependable communications. Those familiar with the Arctic know that we have significant gaps. We have significant challenges in this area. Finland, which has now assumed the chairmanship, will take this issue with them and work with the private sector to do what they can to improve telecom in the  The Arctic Council also launched an Arctic ship traffic data cooperative agreement. The intent is to have a better understanding of the ships that are operating in the  As we all know, we are seeing sea ice recede. We are seeing shipping lanes in areas where we have not had an opportunity to have ships or any level of commerce. With this project, we are seeking to collect information from each Arctic nation about the shipping activity in the Arctic for traffic trend analysis.  This is important because we are seeing an increase in shipping levels in the U.Arctic--an increase by nearly 60 percent over the last 8 years. It is clearly expected to increase with every passing year, as we are seeing sea ice diminish. As we are seeing this increased volume of shipping traffic, I think it is important to keep in mind that when it comes to charting, when it comes to mapping, less than 5 percent of the U.Arctic has been charted to modern standards.  Again, think about what is happening. We are seeing increased shipping traffic. We still don't know as much as we need to know about the charting and the mapping, so it is vital for homeland security, for local security, and for navigational necessity that we have an accurate understanding of who is transiting when and where within the region.  I have talked with Native whaling captains, those who are engaged in a level of subsistence, particularly in the Bering Straits area. Understanding when and where and who is transiting is very important for those subsistence hunters as well.  Another item that came from the Arctic Council ministerial--and this was not a direct outcome from this meeting but the prior one--a new fund, the Algu Fund, was established to help the indigenous peoples of the Arctic more fully participate in the decision making of the Arctic Council and its working groups.  The permanent participants and the indigenous peoples who make up these representatives are a critical piece of the discussion in these significant meetings with Foreign To have that local knowledge, to have the voices of the local people of the Arctic speaking up is important. Think about it. They don't necessarily have a formal government, a fund that can help send them to these meetings, to be part of these working groups. And so oftentimes, their participation is not present, and not because they don't wish to be but because they lack the resources.  So this Algu Fund was established. The goal is to raise $30 million for the fund, which will benefit the Aleut, the Athabaskan, Gwich'in, Sami, and over 40 Russian indigenous groups.  Of the other work that was conducted, seven new observers were added to the Arctic Council, including the country of There were additional organizations that were added, but we are now up to a total of 39 observers, 13 of these being from non-Arctic nations. So again, the interest in all things Arctic, regardless of where you are on the globe, is really increasing.  On the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, there were 12 mayors from Arctic communities in Alaska, Canada, Finland, Iceland, and They held their own forum to look at the challenges to local governments in the Issues such as economic diversification with benefits to local populations, infrastructure investment, energy independence, efforts to adapt to a changing climate, and the incorporation of traditional and local knowledge in the decisionmaking were discussed. These mayors from across the region saw the value of attending the ministerial meeting, even though they were not part of the official meetings. But they also felt that it was important to ensure that the people of the Arctic, those who actually live there, work there, and raise their families there, were heard in the discussions, as well.  Even after all that I have highlighted, there are many other documents from the ministerial meeting that I could mention here, but one that I would like to draw particular attention to is the Fairbanks This is the statement signed by all eight Arctic nations coming out of the 10th Arctic Council I think it is significant to note that, in these issue areas that the United States focused on--Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship, improving economic and living conditions, and addressing the impacts of climate change--the statements coming out were good, strong statements of agreement, and there was true cooperation and collaboration.  I think I would be remiss in stating that there was some speculation that, with a new administration taking over right at the end of the United States' term, there was some discussion as to this: Well, how is this declaration going to be coming about, because it is the United States that ultimately, as the chair, holds the pen there?  I know there has been a lot of discussion around this town about the administration's position on the Paris The President is still determining how he wants to proceed there. But I do think it is noteworthy--very noteworthy--that the Fairbanks Declaration, which was signed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaks directly to climate change in the Specifically, it notes the entry into force of the Paris But in looking specifically to the language relating to climate change, it states, and I will quote here:       Note again that the Arctic is warming at more than twice      the rate of the global average, note with concern that the      pace and scale of continuing Arctic warming will depend on      future emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate      pollutants, reiterate the importance of global action to      reduce both greenhouse gases and short-lived climate      pollutants to mitigate climate change.  Then, it calls for the Arctic Council to undertake additional analysis. So I think that is significant as well. It is an important recognition, and, while this administration has not yet determined where they may end up when it comes to the Paris Agreement, I think it is telling to look to this document--again, that was not only signed by the United States, but, ultimately, it was drafted by the United States--as an indicator of the realities that we face with climate change and, particularly and most noteworthy, in the U.Arctic, where we are seeing that impact most pronounced.  I mentioned the aspect of climate change, but the Declaration is broader[[Page S3182]]than that. It also recognizes the importance of the contributions of the Arctic indigenous peoples, the importance of healthy Arctic communities, the impact of maritime activity in the region, and the emergence of the Arctic Economic Council, which is an issue that I feel very strongly about.  We had an extraordinary Alaskan woman who was chairing the AEC throughout these past 2 years, and she did a fabulous job standing that up. Her contributions were quite remarkable.  There is the need to improve the access of Arctic communities to clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources. So, again, I would commend to anyone's reading the Fairbanks If you are interested in Arctic issues or if you are interested in just a sense of the breadth and the depth of the issues and challenges facing the Arctic region, I think it is an important document.  With our handing the gavel now to Finland, the obvious question request is this: What happens next for the United States in the Arctic? I am encouraged by Secretary Tillerson's comments in Fairbanks that the United States will remain engaged and remain a leader on Arctic policy. That has got to be key. We have made great headway in recognizing that we are an Arctic nation. At every appropriations hearing that I have been to thus far, I think I have reserved my questions to ask about Arctic-specific issues--whether it is the status of where we are on infrastructure, such as icebreakers, or whether it is a recognition and an understanding that, with decreasing sea ice up north, you have people in ships up there, which we have never seen before. Quite honestly, we now have an area of exposure. We focus a lot on the southern border. We now have a northern border that is open. What might that mean?  We were able to query Secretary Kelly this morning about possibly partnering with Canada as we look to how we can provide for sharing of information about who is coming and who is going and knowing what we have in front of us. We will have an opportunity--again, as we move forward with legislative initiatives, appropriations, and reviewing the President's budget--to make sure that the leadership that the United States has demonstrated these past 2 years as we have been chairing the Arctic Council continues and that it continues in a strong and a prominent way.  With that, I thank the  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3180.txt,1694,100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BALLARD LOCKS IN WASHINGTON STATE,2017.0,25.0,May

Ultimately, the U.Army Corps of Engineers, Army Corps, initiated planning for the locks in the late 1890s and work began in earnest under Hiram Chittenden, the Seattle district engineer for the Army Corps from April 1906 to September 1908. Construction began in 1911 after the locks received approval from Congress, and the Ballard Locks were formally opened for vessel traffic on July 4, 1917.  The Ballard Locks enable commercial and recreational vessels to travel to the docks, shipyards, warehouses, maintenance and repair facilities, and marinas in the region's freshwater lakes while also reducing maintenance costs and prolonging vessel life in the freshwater environment. The importance of the locks is underscored by their annual usage. Each year, the Ballard Locks support 45,000 vessel transits and 14,000 lockage counts, which makes them the busiest lock in the United States in overall vessel traffic.

The law requires States and school districts to remove barriers that homeless children and youth face in receiving a high-quality education.

Throughout the United States, there are many quality veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses that sell office and janitorial supplies or provide building maintenance services. Those businesses and the government would mutually benefit if the businesses seeking Federal contracts were given a fair chance to compete.  But as it stands now, veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are losing out on such opportunities because of an unintentional loophole when the VA contracts with the General Services Administration, the GSA, for office and janitorial services, equipment, and supplies.  Now, that loophole opened up last year when the VA implemented the Kingdomware Supreme Court ruling. Normally, when it comes to its contracts, the VA ensures that veteran-owned small businesses are considered in the bidding process. But the Kingdomware ruling required that the VA set aside contracts for veteran-owned small businesses when there are two or more companies that are interested, capable, and can perform at a fair and reasonable price. So when the VA contracts with the GSA for janitorial or office supplies, the GSA is not giving veteran-owned businesses the proper consideration for those types of contracts; thus, the requirement to consider veteran-owned businesses is not being implemented.  Fortunately, this bill, our bill, Democrats' and Republicans' bill, would close that loophole. It would require the VA Secretary to work with the GSA to increase the number of service-disabled veteran and veteran-owned small businesses represented in that contracting process.  The bill would eliminate that barrier that limited our veterans and their businesses from contracting with the government. It is a solution that is fair to veteran entrepreneurs. It is a bill that has strong bipartisan support. It is a bill that moved through the House Veterans' Affairs Committee with unanimous consent, and it is a bill that all of us are proud of, Democrats and Republicans, and that is why I am proud to sponsor this bill. I am proud to present it to you with the gentleman from Florida because it will do[[Page H6178]]what is smart for our country's veterans, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

8305,topic-id,706,"Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentlemen, Mr.Faso and Mr.Collins, for their leadership on this issue.  Mr.Speaker, in my district, the 23rd Congressional District, where we sit on the border of the State of Pennsylvania, when you talk about the tax burden that is placed on my hardworking residents that are struggling, that are trying to pay utility bills, that are trying to pay for food to put on their tables, that are trying to take care of their families and put their kids through school, when you talk about a tax burden that is driven by the Medicaid shift in New York State to the local level, at our county level--a very unique circumstance across the country--to the tune of $145 million a year in each of the counties I represent, that type of burden is not sustainable.  I thank the leadership of Mr.Faso and Mr.Collins for looking for a solution in the American Health Care Act that will alleviate this, that will once and for all shift this burden from our hardworking citizens, our hardworking taxpayers in western New York back to where it belongs: to our State capital, our State capital where they have mandated, under the Federal Medicaid program, essentially every optional service that is authorized under the program; where you see numbers in New York State where we spend approximately $4,000 per enrollee versus California, another State that has invested tremendously in expanding Medicaid and Medicaid services, at $2,500; where you see reports that in New York State our average costs are 44 percent, in New York State, under Medicaid spending than the national average.  And then you look at small things that do add up: taxi services that are reimbursed under Medicaid in New York State to the tune of $2.20 a mile. Mr.Speaker, every hardworking resident in my district that is watching tonight knows that if they go to submit a mileage reimbursement to their employer or they go and try to get reimbursement from their local government that they work at, they are getting 55 cents or maybe 53.5 cents. That money adds up.  You also see a Medicaid program in New York that is ripe with waste, fraud, and abuse; and by putting that $145 million tax burden on our local taxpayers, our counties cannot address that waste, fraud, and abuse. That can only be done in our State capital. So I think it is only right that we put the burden on our State capital, who has the authority, the flexibility, and the ability to address these issues, to have to deal with this burden at the same time they can implement solutions.  If our Governor so chooses to make this type of waste, fraud, and abuse rampant through Medicaid, that is his choice. But he shouldn't put it on our backs, our local residents' backs, to the tune of $145 million of taxpayer dollars that they have no ability to address at the local level.  I also remember, vividly, a story from one of our first responders, an Olean firefighter who came in and talked about him being part of ObamaCare ambulance service where they would pick up individuals who would call for services and claim to be experiencing a medical emergency; and then as they delivered the patient to the hospital, that same patient would refuse service at the ER so they could go to the mall across the street--a ride in an ambulance that is paid for by our hardworking residents in western New  We are generous people. We don't mind helping people out. But when you put a burden like this on our backs and you don't give us the flexibility and ability to address these concerns, that is wrong. And what this amendment does, and I am proud to support it and stand here with my colleagues, is right this wrong once and for all and put the burden where it needs to be: in our State capital. Let our Governor own this and, hopefully, wise up and deal with it at that level and take this burden off our hardworking taxpayers.  Thank you, Mr.Faso and Mr.Collins for this leadership, and we are wholeheartedly behind you.  ",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4986-4.txt,1982,S. RES. 176,2017.0,20.0,June
8262,topic-id,787,"Mr.Speaker, I am sorry that my two colleagues refused to yield any time when they are talking, especially when they are using phrases like naked partisanship. That is very interesting, isn't it? We could have had a nice dialog here. I was asking for a chance to go into a dialogue so the American people could understand what was being said rather than this incredible naked partisanship of people who disagree, but I won't yield my time to have a dialogue about it.  I am afraid that doesn't cut it. This is yet another example of what we have seen of people using sinister-sounding descriptions in order to basically distract us from some of the corruption and, I might add, questionable activities of their own Presidential candidate in the last election who was defeated because the American people did not trust that candidate.  By the way, I would like to have asked--I am sorry that my friends have left and wouldn't yield any time for a question--whether or not they believe that Hillary Clinton's activities in Russia while she was a government official, was she involved in money raising from Russian oligarchs to the tune of millions--tens of millions--of dollars?  Was her husband involved in raising this money while she was Secretary of State or while she was a candidate for President of the United States over in Russia, millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation? I understand even hundreds of thousands of dollars were put in her husband's pocket for a speech that he gave in                              {time}  1315  These things need to be looked at. Instead, what we are hearing about is sinister-sounding words about a meeting where someone said they had some information that would help, yes, the campaign, but the reason it would help the campaign is there was supposedly information that showed that Hillary Clinton was involved in some activity that was contrary to the interests of the United States or contrary to the law.  Yes, if someone says to you that they want to give you information, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I would hope that my colleagues who just said what is happening on our side of the aisle is naked partisanship, I wonder if the Democratic Party and my other colleagues in this body are calling for Hillary to release all of her emails and to make sure that we have under oath an explanation of these transactions to the Clinton Instead, we are hearing all sorts of sinister descriptions of a meeting that was going to give information.  I will tell you right now, everybody in this body, if they think that there could be information that is important for our country to know from any foreigner, we should talk to them and find out what it is. It is not illegal to receive information from someone, especially if you are engaged in an activity that is aimed at trying to secure understanding for policies that you plan to implement as a leader in the United States as an elected leader. There absolutely is nothing wrong.  By the way, I am the chairman of the Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats Russia is in my jurisdiction. Should I ever turn down a chance to talk to somebody who has information for me, negative or positive, about Russia?  No, I shouldn't. And neither should the Trump campaign have ignored any community to receive more information about what was being done by Hillary, perhaps, and the raising of the millions of dollars for the foundation.  So that was a legitimate thing to ask. Then you determine: Is the information accurate or is it not accurate? If it is not accurate, you don't want to touch it.  But many people were disturbed that there had been a release of emails during the campaign, and a lot of the questions about this whole Russia issue is whether Russia or somebody else actually hacked into the system and released those emails.[[Page H5879]]  I think what is important is only whether truth was revealed. If someone was talking about releasing negative and false information, the public should be upset about that. But they should not be upset if they are being given a chance to see more information that is accurate information on this issue.  I would hope and trust that the American people are smart enough to see a diversionary tactic using sinister words over and over again to describe something that is perfectly legal. In some cases, as I say, talking to anybody to get more information to help you make your decisions is a good thing and not a bad thing.

8266,topic-id,297,"Mr.Speaker, well, we know now people are trying to frighten us and others not to meet with people and not to talk to people. I wonder why.  As far as I am concerned, I don't have just a blind trust in whatever our intelligence agencies give us. Let me note that many of the things that are being quoted aren't even being quoted from our intelligence agencies during this whole national discussion on what Russia's interaction with us has been for the last couple of years.  The fact is that these intelligence reports are filled with weasel words. A weasel word is making it sound like you are saying something, but you put a phrase in that actually doesn't commit you to defending that particular position as being factual.  With that said, I would hope that the American people pay close attention to the sinister words, but also the weasel words, and pay attention to the basic nonsense in telling us that: Oh, a horrible crime has been committed now, because someone in the Trump campaign--whoever it was; I don't care if it was Donald Trump's relatives or his son or whoever it was, anybody in the campaign whatsoever--wants to talk to anybody in the world to get information, I think that is a good thing.  Whether or not at that point it has to be determined whether it is accurate information, to move forward with accurate information is wrong, but your job, too, is to verify what somebody is telling you before you let it influence your policymaking or the decisions that you are making at that moment.

8267,topic-id,718,"Mr.Chairman, I am the chairman, as I mentioned, of the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging I am a senior member also of the Science, Space, and Technology I am here, basically, to discuss emerging technology that is unleashing a new economic dynamic, but it could also be negatively impacting on our national security.  I have long considered myself a proponent of freedom. Instead of government controls, I have trusted free people and free markets with optimism that technology and innovation would deal with the perplexing challenges to our security and our prosperity.  In recent years, one of the more exciting innovations helping reshape the way we live is the introduction of digital currency here and globally.  Thanks to this leap in technology, times are changing right before our eyes. Americans have new ways of fighting inflation and handling their personal business obligations. People with bitcoins living under despotic regimes throughout the world now have the opportunity to protect their assets from abusive and corrupt government. Indeed, the security of the blockchain technology will enable a new wave of societal advances that should invigorate our markets and improve lives.  However, with all that potential benefit of digital currency, there is also danger. It empowers the good people of the world, but it also can be used by those who have goals that are malevolent and evil.  Radical Islamic terrorism is now a horrendous threat that hangs over all the free people in the world, in the United States, and elsewhere. Law enforcement throughout the world is now aware that bitcoin is available for use for terrorists in accomplishing their gruesome missions.  What makes it a good deal for terrorists?  It is anonymous. They can transfer funds using a digital currency platform without any of the usual safeguards that thwart terrorists and criminal activity.  Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards have worked to deal with criminals in recent decades, but now that approach can be technologically undermined by the use of the bitcoin instead of traditional currency.  Since digital currencies such as the bitcoin offer a free ability to transfer funds, some of our neighbors, such as Sweden, Thailand, Vietnam, and India, have banned their use.  Mr.Speaker, I do not believe that that is a necessary or practical response. Banning digital currencies will not prevent terrorists from using them any more than banning guns will prevent criminals from using them.  Instead of banning all the digital currencies because some lack standards, I believe we should encourage digital currencies to implement full anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards.

Internship programs also help to identify and develop the next generation of Federal employees. In exchange, interns gain invaluable work experience in a field that they might hope to enter upon graduation and credit they can apply at their institution of learning.  Unfortunately, there are no existing provisions in Federal law that protect interns working at Federal agencies against harassment or discrimination.  In the case of O'Connor v. Davis, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a decision finding an intern could not bring sexual harassment claims under Federal law.                              {time}  1530  The court reasoned that since the intern was not a Federal employee, that person was not covered by existing law. It concluded that: ``It is for Congress, if it should choose to do so . . . to provide a remedy. . . .''  Mr.Speaker, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee heard testimony showing the damage this loophole can have at Federal agencies. In a 2015 hearing on Environmental Protection Agency mismanagement, witnesses described allegations of sexual harassment against interns. According to testimony, ``one former intern stated that because of this harassment, she changed her mind about not only about working for EPA but also for working in the Federal sector at all.''  This is simply unacceptable.  Mr.Speaker, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2017 ensures that interns working for the Federal Government receive anti-discriminatory and anti-harassment protections. Specifically, the bill prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicapping condition for interns working at Federal agencies.

Coming from a very careful civil servant from the intelligence community, Mr.Brennan's testimony should further compel Congress and the special counsel to pursue the full truth. What Mr.Brennan said was happening gets at the very core of our democracy, the free and fair election of our representatives.

8334,topic-id,619,"Mr.President, I wish to speak in strong support of the U.Paris climate change agreement and in opposition to efforts to undermine this international agreement that is vital to the environmental and economic well-being of New Hampshire, the Nation, and the world.  In 2015, I joined nine of my Senate colleagues in Paris to attend the 21st U.Climate Change Conference, also known as COP 21, where the climate agreement was negotiated. What we witnessed at COP 21 was monumental: 195 countries representing more than 95 percent of global carbon emissions worked together to adopt the first universal climate agreement that calls for international cooperation on addressing the causes of global warming and helping poorer nations most affected by it. The following year, on Earth Day, the United States and more than 170 nations signed the international climate agreement in New York; and on November 4, 2016, the Paris Accord entered into force.  I am proud to say that the U.was a big part of that effort. That is why I am so disappointed to see that President Trump is currently considering whether to pull the United States from this historic agreement. This would be a huge mistake.  No country is insulated from the increasingly present and escalating effects of climate change. In the United States, we are seeing it throughout the country, and this is certainly true in New Rising temperatures are shortening our fall foliage season, which is so important to our State's tourism economy. Milder winters have led to increases of insect-borne diseases that endanger our wildlife. In New Hampshire, we have already seen a 40 percent decline in our moose population. The changing climate is also putting more stress on sugar maples, and this is already affecting syrup production.  The Paris Agreement establishes a long-term, durable global framework for countries to work together to reduce carbon emissions and keep the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. For the first time, countries have committed to putting forward ambitious, nationally determined climate targets and reporting on their progress towards those targets using a standardized process of review. The Paris Agreement encourages transparency, accountability, and collaboration among nations not only to meet their climate targets, but to encourage innovation while doing so.  That is why American business leaders are strongly in favor of continued U.participation in the Paris accord. From oil giants to tech firms, corporate leaders understand that the transition to clean energy presents one of the biggest economic opportunities of this century to create jobs and build wealth in this country. In fact, the International Energy Agency projects that, over the coming decades, more than $60 trillion will be invested in energy efficiency and clean energy technologies as countries address the threat of climate change. The United States stands in a unique position to be the leader of the clean energy revolution. This would be jeopardized if the President decides to remove the United States from the international climate agreement.  Climate change represents an enormous challenge, but the solutions are within reach if we put into place policies that allow for swift action. The United States must help ensure that the goals of the Paris Agreement are realized. That is why I joined with my colleagues to introduce a resolution stating that the United States should work in cooperation with the international community and continue to exercise global leadership to address the causes and effects of climate change. We have a responsibility to help protect our children and grandchildren from the most severe consequences of global warming by reducing emissions now. This President must not remove the United States from this important agreement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-08-pt1-PgS2798.txt,1901,HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW,2017.0,8.0,May

8309,topic-id,1128,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Faso for his leadership, and also for the great comments from Congressman Collins in the western New York district and for coming up with this really great piece of legislation.  It is no secret that New York residents pay among the highest taxes in the Combined State and local taxes consume over 13 percent of the average household income.  Decades of tax-and-spend policies have depleted the wallets of hardworking middle class families and forced many small businesses--including family farms; once a tradition in New York--into closure, and driven lifelong residents out of our State in record numbers forever. These burdensome taxes, coupled with crushing regulations, have led to the worst business climate in the country. Small businesses, which create over 70 percent of the new jobs, face the threat of extinction in New  Year after year, New York continues to be ranked the highest in out-migration in the entire Nearly 200,000 people have left the Empire State, and two of the worst hit regions--the Mohawk Valley and the southern tier--are located in the 22nd Additionally, the two largest cities in our district--Utica and Binghamton--are ranked last and second to last in economic growth.  Hardworking families and our job creators desperately need tax relief. That is why I am working with the New York delegation and the Republican congressional delegation to lead the charge by cosponsoring the Property Tax Reduction Act sponsored by Mr.Faso and Mr.Collins and cosponsored by the rest of us.  As a note, I would just like to mention that, as a former member of the State assembly, I did sponsor legislation very similar to the type of relief being proposed in this wonderful piece of legislation known as the Property Tax Reduction That legislation was cosponsored in a bipartisan way with Democrats who also recognized the need to change the paradigm in New York  The Property Tax Reduction Act will bring the largest local mandate relief initiative to my area in my lifetime, potentially saving the taxpayers in the 22nd District more than $167 million annually in unfunded State Medicaid mandates. This bill relieves county governments from the burden forced upon them by Albany bureaucrats led by our  Currently, in New York State, the law requires approximately $2.3 billion, as was mentioned earlier, that is taken from our local county governments and given to the State for the Medicaid program. This amounts to about $140 million per week.  In 2015, Oneida County was forced to divert more than 80 percent of the property tax levies to subsidize Albany's bloated budgets. This amounts to $54.4 million annually in Oneida County losses every year to cover the cost of their share of  In Broome County, more than half of the county's $70 million in property tax revenue, about $37 million, was taken from the county last year and diverted to Albany--a loss of more than, as I said, $37 million. This is money that would otherwise go to reduce property taxes, fund our schools, make much-needed improvements to infrastructure, and support our first responders, among many other programs, that we need on a county level.  Combined property and sales tax rates as a percentage of value rank many of New York's counties among[[Page H4989]]the highest taxed counties in the Nation, with Oneida County being ranked 19 in the latest Tax Foundation survey. No other State in the country abuses its local governments and taxpayers quite like Albany does in order to fund its most expansive and really overly generous Medicaid programs in the  New York's Medicaid program has the highest incidents of fraud, abuse, and waste in the country. If other States can provide high-quality healthcare to vulnerable citizens without taking advantage of local taxpayers, so can New The imposition of over $2.5 billion in Medicaid costs on to the counties is nearly seven times costlier than what counties in California pay, despite having higher enrollments and expenditures.  The Property Tax Reduction Act requires Governor Cuomo and the State to pay its full share of the Medicaid program that it should be paying in full and that it also forces on to the county and local governments.  This bill does not propose cuts to the programs in the 22nd Rather, it requires Albany to put its fiscal house in order. It requires Albany to take stock of the money that it has been using, sending these unfunded mandates to our strapped local governments.  This legislation, as the sponsor has indicated, gives the State ample time to realign the budget, to rein in out-of-control spending, and to give the taxpayers relief once and for all at the county level.  If Governor Cuomo chooses to hurt the citizens by slashing programs that upstate New Yorkers want and need with a mammoth State budget that was over $152 billion this year for fiscal year 2017, that is his choice, not something that has been brought on by that act. His failed leadership continues to produce budgets laden with unconstitutional executive pork and wasteful spending.  In fact, let's just take a look at a couple of the items. Over $370 million in Albany's budget these past few years was spent on the corrupt and mismanaged StartUP New York program, which produced only one-third of the promised jobs. Over $1.3 billion in tax breaks have been handed over to Hollywood filmmakers in the last 2 years. In all, Albany spends over $8 billion in taxpayer money on a job-creation program with little results to show for it.  The bill will simply force the State to work over a period of several years to responsibly reduce the unfair and unreasonable Medicaid liability that has been forced on to our counties. Upstate New York is in desperate need of property tax relief.  This bill is the first step in making the relief a reality. County executives and local governments across the State have voiced their support of this legislation.  While hardworking families struggle, Albany sits idly by. That is why we are taking the lead on the Federal level to help revive our region and bring business and people back to beautiful upstate New By giving county governments a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reduce property taxes, this bill will save millions of dollars and hard-earned tax dollars for working families.  On behalf of the 22nd District, I just want to thank my colleagues for really taking the effort to bring this to the floor and showing true leadership in the face of difficult circumstances in finding a real solution, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for all of us as taxpayers in New York to finally have some relief, to grow our business community, and to find some kind of dynamism in our economy.

As announced by Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Warner on Tuesday, May 9; the Intelligence Committee has made a request to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,  I have stated repeatedly that we must follow the money if we are going to get to the bottom of how Russia has attacked our democracy. That means thoroughly reviewing any information that relates to financial connections between Russia and President Trump and his associates, whether direct or laundered through hidden or illicit transactions.

8255,topic-id,184,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to stand shoulder to shoulder with our friends and allies in Great Britain, who have suffered three horrific terror attacks in a period of less than 3 months.  These attacks at the hands of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria are barbaric, evil, and must be condemned by the entire world. These cowards have used vehicles, knives, and bombs to rein terror down on London and Manchester, even targeting innocent young girls at a concert hall.  Radical Islamic extremism is a vile ideology that must be stamped out at every corner of the world. This is a time for unity of purpose and strong leadership.  The United States, our NATO allies, and our allies in the Middle East must chart a unified course towards complete destruction of As we begin to succeed in the fight, their resolve to attack us will only grow stronger, but we cannot be deterred.  Mr.Speaker, freedom and liberty must win over hatred and extremism. We must defeat this enemy, and this Congress stands ready to support this administration in its efforts to do so.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4659-6.txt,2021,DEFEATING THE ISIS ENEMY,2017.0,7.0,June
