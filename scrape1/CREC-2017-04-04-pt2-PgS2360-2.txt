                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES C. FOX

 Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to honor the work of the 
Honorable James C. Fox, who retired last month after over 35 years of 
service on the Federal bench.
  Judge Fox was born in Kansas but has spent most of his life in North 
Carolina, graudating from the University of North Carolina with both 
his undergraduate and law degrees. Following law school, he clerked for 
the Honorable Don Gilliam in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of North Carolina. After time in private practice and as the 
county attorney for New Hanover County, Judge Fox was nominated by 
President Reagan to serve where he had previously clerked: the U.S. 
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
  Judge Fox served chief judge from 1990-1997, and while he took senior 
status in 2001, he maintained a significant caseload until his 
retirement last week. His dedication to the law is to be commended and 
is exceeded only by his dedication to his family. I wish him all the 
best in retirement as he spends time with his wife, Kate, and his 
children and grandchildren, and I am grateful for his service.
