              ROWLAND THEATRE CELEBRATES 100TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
a true gem in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, the Rowland Theatre, which 
celebrates its 100th anniversary this year.
  Rowland Theatre opened its doors on June 4, 1917. Its visionary was 
Congressman Charles Rowland, who was elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1915 and represented the 21st Congressional 
District, which included Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, and McKean 
Counties.
  The Rowland Theatre was actually one small part of Congressman 
Rowland's life, but it would be the project that would become his 
legacy. The theater not only showed the latest silent movies during its 
first few decades, it was also the location for the top traveling shows 
in the country.
  Now the Rowland Theatre shows feature films and also hosts plays, as 
well as choir and orchestra performances. The 1,000-seat theater 
remains an anchor of downtown Philipsburg, and it is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. The Rowland Theatre is open 364 
days a year, closing only on Christmas Eve.
  Mr. Speaker, the Rowland Theatre is a real treasure. Here is to 
another 100 years.
  Congratulations.
