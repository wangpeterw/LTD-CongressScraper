                         PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am wondering whether or not you could 
inform us whether or not a CBO score has been completed on the 
Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act because many of us are 
worried it will kick up to 20 million Americans off their health 
coverage. It will increase out-of-pocket expenses for millions of 
families.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not stating a proper 
parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I will give the Republicans a little bit 
more time to request a CBO score.
