             CONGRATULATING COMMANDER HUGGAN ON HIS CAREER

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an exceptional 
member of the United States Navy on the event of his retirement, 
Commander Doug Huggan.
  On Friday, July 14, Commander Huggan completed his tour as the 
commanding officer of the Naval Support Activity Florida. This caps a 
long and distinguished career.
  His service to the Navy started as an E-6 airborne command pilot and 
has taken him around the world, from the European Command to Japan, and 
finally to Panama City.
  While at NSA Panama City, Commander Huggan led over 3,000 Active-Duty 
and civilian personnel in performing critical missions, including 
surface warfare training, explosive ordnance disposal, salvage 
training, and experimental diving.
  His leadership over the last 2 years in the Second District is a 
testament to the core values instilled upon all those who serve in the 
Navy.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Commander Huggan 
and his family for their years of service and sacrifice, and wish them 
luck as they move on to enjoy a new chapter in their life.
