                          REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, just calling this tax bill a middle class 
tax bill does not make it so. You actually have to read the bill. And 
if you do, you will find that the vast majority of the benefit goes to 
the people at the very top: the wealthiest Americans, multinational 
corporations. They are the beneficiaries of this Republican tax scam.
  Saying it benefits the middle class does not make it so, and, in 
fact, many in the middle class, tens of millions of people in the 
middle class, will pay more taxes so that we can do what? Give huge tax 
breaks to the people at the very top.
  And how do they pay for that? They borrow money.
  All these deficit hawks, all these people over here who have said 
over and over again that it is immoral to pass debt on to our children 
and grandchildren will walk to the floor of this House and they will 
vote to send $1.5 trillion in debt to their kids and grandkids to give 
corporations and the wealthiest Americans a tax break.
  It is immoral. It is immoral.
