                          BORDER WALL FUNDING

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment that 
Republican leadership has added something as controversial as funding 
for the border wall to a critical bill funding our Nation's defense.
  There is a reason those who live on the border and know the region 
best don't want this wall. They know this wall won't keep us safe, and 
they know it won't stop illegal immigration.
  Instead of wasting $1.6 billion in taxpayer dollars on a piece of 
security theater, DHS should focus its limited resources on its 
declared mission, which is ``to safeguard the American people, our 
homeland, and our values.'' This wall does none of that.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop playing politics with our 
security and bring a clean bill to the floor.
