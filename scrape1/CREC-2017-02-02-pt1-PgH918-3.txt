   HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PROTECTS SENIORS' SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am thankful we have in the process here 
as elected officials the ability to hold accountable Federal agencies 
and new rules that will be made at midnight. I am speaking of 
legislation passed today to allow, in many cases, seniors who might see 
their Second Amendment rights limited or taken away by a last-minute 
rule that would require them to be turned in to the national background 
check system in this country, thereby, because they might be on SSI or 
disability, losing their ability perhaps to own a firearm under their 
Second Amendment rights.
  The House of Representatives took steps today to ensure their ability 
to not be singled out because they might be in a particular system and 
assumed to be a risk--unlike anybody else. So we can do good work 
sometimes, and we do when we strike out for protecting people's rights.
