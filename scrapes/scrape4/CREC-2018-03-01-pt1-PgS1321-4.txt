                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 5, 2018

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday, 
March 5; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning 
hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, 
the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the 
day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that following 
leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the Scholer nomination under the previous order.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
