          HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DURING POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, tens of 
thousands of law enforcement officers from across the country arrived 
in Washington for National Police Week.
  Established by a joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National 
Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers 
who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and 
protection of others. National Police Week is a collaborative effort of 
many organizations dedicated to honoring America's law enforcement 
community.
  The National Peace Officers' Memorial Service took place on Monday as 
the Nation paused to remember officers who made the ultimate sacrifice. 
A candlelight vigil hosted Saturday evening recognized nearly 400 
fallen officers. This week honors the men and women in blue who gave 
everything to protect their country and their communities.
  Earlier this year, Pennsylvania mourned the loss of 23-year-old State 
Trooper Landon Weaver, who was killed in the line of duty on December 
30, 2016.
  Our officers put on their uniforms each day knowing that they can be 
in harm's way at any moment. On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you 
to all of our officers who serve.
