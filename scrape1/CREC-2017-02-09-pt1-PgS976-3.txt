                    NOMINATION OF STEVEN T. MNUCHIN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will have more to say about Mr. 
Mnuchin tomorrow, but let me say this. For the last 8 years, Americans 
had to endure an economy that failed to live up to its potential. Part 
of the problem was the regulatory avalanche of the last administration. 
It is time to finally move toward a modern regulatory framework 
instead, one that appropriately manages risks while promoting growth 
and job creation. The President has started providing relief already 
that will move us toward that goal. Steve Mnuchin can help do more.
  He also has an important role to play in the effort to make our tax 
system simpler and more conducive to the kind of economic growth and 
job creation we should all want. It won't be easy to get that done. We 
need someone like Steve Mnuchin working with both parties to make it 
happen.
  The Treasury nominee is smart, capable, and he has impressive private 
sector experience. We need him confirmed as soon as possible so he can 
begin to tackle these challenges and reverse the last 8 years of 
economic heartache.
