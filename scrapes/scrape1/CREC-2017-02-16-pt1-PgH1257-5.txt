               WE MUST HAVE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Russia is an alarming force in 
the world, a nuclear power with an authoritarian President, menacing 
our European allies with invasion into Ukraine and threats of incursion 
into other Baltic states, lifting mass murderer Assad in Syria, 
interfering in democratic elections around the world and here in our 
country, and now evidence is mounting that the White House-Putin 
connections run deep.
  Michael Flynn's shady dealings and lies to the Vice President and the 
public--what did the President know? When did he know it?
  Answers to these and other questions are critical to our national 
security. We must have an independent investigation. The American 
people deserve nothing less.
