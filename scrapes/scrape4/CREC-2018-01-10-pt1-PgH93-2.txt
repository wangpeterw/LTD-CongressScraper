                       MORE MONEY, LESS PROBLEMS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was grateful 
to learn that Tidewater Boats is investing $8.3 million to expand their 
manufacturing facility in Lexington, South Carolina, creating 100 new 
jobs.
  This news is on top of Aflac announcing they will be expanding their 
700 employees in Columbia, South Carolina, and doubling their employee 
401(k) matching funds.
  On the same day Republicans passed historic tax cuts, AT&T, led by 
Pam Lackey, announced they are providing 200,000 employees a $1,000 
bonus. Comcast will be providing $1,000 bonuses to 100,000 employees. 
BB&T, a valued corporate citizen led by Mike Brennan, will be raising 
their employee wages to $15 an hour and providing a $1,200 bonus for 
27,000 employees.
  Boeing of Charleston announced they will be donating $100 million to 
charities that focus on education, local communities, veterans, and 
military personnel.
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not only for businesses. I appreciate 
that next month American families will see more of their own money in 
their paycheck.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Best wishes to Darrell Issa and Kathy Issa for their dedicated 
service as they announce retirement. We look forward to their continued 
service for the American people.
