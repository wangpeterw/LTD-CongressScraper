    COMMENDING SERGEANTS CHARLES JEFFERS AND GERALD ``JAKE'' STOFKO

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the careers of 
Sergeants Charles Jeffers and Gerald ``Jake'' Stofko of the Johnstown 
Police Department.
  Sergeant Jeffers valiantly served the Johnstown community for 48 
years, forging a legacy of bravery in public service.
  Sergeant Stofko's 25-year-long career with the Johnstown Police 
Department is one marked by excellence and dedication. Spending the 
majority of his career working the midnight shift, the Johnstown 
residents could sleep soundly knowing that Sergeant Stofko was on 
watch.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate these brave officers 
for their combined 73 years of service and commitment to protecting the 
people of Johnstown. I wish them both the best as they move forward 
into the next chapter of their lives.
