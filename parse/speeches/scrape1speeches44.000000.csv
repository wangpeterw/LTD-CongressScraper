8708,topic-id,183,"Madam Speaker, for the last 8 years, Americans have felt the burden of excessive and intense regulatory overreach having to comply with time-consuming rules and regulations. But that ends now. For the first time in 8 years, the legislative branch and the executive branch are on the same page. We must get the government out of the way.  Last week, I joined my colleagues on the One In, One Out Act, which requires Federal agencies to repeal or revise a rule before they can issue a new one, and any new rule must be of equal or lesser cost to  And in true Trump fashion this week, the President announced his own version, the one in, two out executive order.  These measures are commonsense at their core. To begin growing our economy and creating jobs, we have got to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government and tackle the mountain of red tape surrounding our Nation's job creators. Americans are ready for growth and innovation, and, for the first time in a long time, the President is on our side.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgH860-5.txt,2239,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,1.0,March
8981,topic-id,310,"Mr.Speaker, the facts are indisputable: President Obama's attempt to plan our healthcare economy from Washington, D.C., has failed.  I have spent nearly 2 years criss-crossing 29 counties in west Texas, and I can report from the many stories from my constituents that no single law or policy has been more reviled, more destructive, or more intrusive than It is absolutely crushing our small businesses and Main Street Americans everywhere.  The American Health Care Act repeals ObamaCare and is a step in the right direction to freeing the American people from the scourge of government-controlled health care.  For the first time since the passage of ObamaCare, according to the Congressional Budget Office's report recently, the American Health Care Act will lower premiums over time by 10 percent, a far cry from the skyrocketing premiums we have seen over the last several years since the passage of the Affordable Care  The report goes on to say that the American Health Care Act will reduce the deficit by $337 billion and make the biggest entitlement reform in generations, saving taxpayers well over $800 billion.  This bill strikes at the heart of ObamaCare by repealing its mandates, eliminating its taxes, and gutting its regulations.  Make no mistake, this legislation is not perfect. I will continue to fight for more conservative and more fiscally responsible policy outcomes like work requirements for able-bodied adults. But when the dust settles and the debate is over, we cannot allow perfect policy aspirations to be the enemy of good, conservative results. The alternative, Mr.Speaker, is simply unacceptable.                              {time}  2015  My constituents sent me to Washington to tackle the tough issues and solve the big problems.

8983,topic-id,912,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the American Health Care  ObamaCare has failed, and we need to replace it. It has made health care inaccessible for many of the Americans it was created to help. Our premiums have skyrocketed, small business growth has been stunted as it can't expand due to health care regulations, and employees have seen their hours cut. Individuals are forced to purchase healthcare coverage they do not want.  Over the past 2 years, I have met with many Nebraskans in my district. I keep hearing about the broken promises of ObamaCare and the tight stranglehold this law has created for the American people. I have heard from a young mother who had to pay for the whole bill of the delivery of her child. The ACA plan she was on had a $12,000 deductible, and that plan didn't help her one cent.  Another citizen from Omaha, Jeanine, was happy with her healthcare insurance for decades. Five years ago, she was paying $323 a month and was satisfied with the coverage she had. Four years ago, she was told by her insurance company that she would have to pay more because she would need additional coverage, like maternity coverage, even though she was past that stage in her life. Two years ago, that insurance plan of Jeanine's jumped to $690 a month--double.  However, her health insurance company had another policy under ACA which she could switch to. She did so for $150 a month with a $550 credit. At least, she had that plan until her insurance company dropped that ACA policy and sent Jeanine searching for another policy. Now Jeanine is on an ACA policy that covers her primary doctor but not her dentist or her pharmacy. All Jeanine wants is a healthcare plan that fits her needs. She does not want the Federal Government telling her what coverage she must purchase.  Imagine for just a second that you have been happy for decades with a product you use, and one day the government comes in and tells you that you don't know what is best for you. They force you to pay more, and in return you get something that doesn't work. ACA is like the government telling you that you need to buy an expensive, fast, shiny sports car with all the bells and whistles, when all you wanted was a less expensive economy car to get you around town. But later you find out that that fancy sports car is actually a lemon.  That is exactly what happened to Jeanine and countless other Americans when ObamaCare forced them to coverage they did not want or need. This is more than a failed system. It is wrong to the core, and this is what the American Health Care Act is designed to fix.  The American Health Care Act is a step in the right direction, and we are fulfilling our promises to repair the problems that ACA has left us. This legislation repeals major flaws of ObamaCare, such as employer and individual mandates, letting individuals choose what coverage is best for them. Under this bill, health savings accounts will be expanded and will give tax credits for those who buy their own insurance to give them parity with those who get employer-provided coverage tax free. These are things that I campaigned on and promised to fight for, and they are in the bill.  The bill also gives States more control over their healthcare policies, allowing for patient-centered health care and getting the Federal bureaucrats out of the discussion. The American Health Care Act, instead, allows for individuals to choose the health insurance plans based on their needs and budget, allowing for Americans to have greater access and to find a health plan that is right for them. The CBO shows that it is going to lower those premiums by 10 percent. Now, Nebraska had a 51 percent increase last year, Mr.This plan is going to lower premiums by 10 percent.  The American Health Care Act will reduce the deficit and cut taxes. According to Monday's CBO score, this bill will reduce the Federal deficit by $337 billion and lower taxes by $883 billion. That is good for  Finally, the American Health Care Act does this and yet preserves affordable insurance for those with preexisting conditions and maintains a safety net for those who cannot pay premiums. These are things that I also promised to fight for, and they are in the bill.  I look forward to working with my fellow House Members on both sides of the aisle to deliver the best law for the American people. We are going to be debating this bill for the next few weeks, and we are going to make it better.  I am proud that this Congress and the Republican leadership have made a commitment to passing this legislation in an open and transparent process. This is a good first step toward fixing the mess of the  Before we vote on this, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to carefully read the bill so they can find out what is in it. Unlike ObamaCare, we don't have to pass this to find out what is in it. We know now.  This is a great step forward, a patient-centered, doctor-supported healthcare system that gives power back to the States and gets the bureaucrat out of our healthcare decisions.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this.  ",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,15.0,March
8681,topic-id,272,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the West Coast Dungeness crab fishery agreement.  This successful, two-decades-old tristate Dungeness crab management agreement expired on September 30, 2016. This bill simply extends the working management authority between Washington, Oregon, and California and makes this arrangement permanent. A similar measure passed the House last year with flying colors.  For approximately two decades, these States have successfully overseen one of the most valuable fisheries in the Pacific In 2014, fishermen delivered 53 million pounds of crab to market, totaling $170 million. This economic activity helps support more than 60,000 jobs related to the seafood industry in Washington alone.  How has it maintained its success? The fishery has been managed in a sustainable, science-based way, and, importantly, it doesn't cost taxpayers a[[Page H714]]dime. If we do not renew this agreement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, says its management of this fishery will cost taxpayers $1.15 million per year.  Simply put, this bill maintains local control of a crucial resource and ensures sustainability of the Dungeness crab fishery, all while saving taxpayer dollars. This bill is the kind of commonsense policy that those folks I represent at home in southwest Washington expect to see out of Washington, D. I want to thank Chairman Bishop and the House Natural Resources staff for bringing this bill to the floor. Passage of this bipartisan bill gives fishermen and coastal communities on the West Coast peace of mind.

It has extended coverage to people who otherwise would not have it. Repeal of this amazing accomplishment would be unprecedented. It would be sad, and it would be wrong.

8841,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, in this Chamber last night, as I listened to the President's address to the joint session, I could only think of one word: ``resist.''  Whether one voted for Donald Trump or not, we are all obligated to resist his incoherent and contradictory pledge to dismantle the protections of the Affordable Care Act with empty slogans.  Perhaps the most revealing moment of the Trump administration so far was his declaration Monday in his meeting with America's Governors that health care is complex. ``Who knew?'' he said.  Well, anybody who has done any work, any research, or had even had conversations with the people who rely on health care, who study health care, or deliver health care. This was not a secret that it is complex. Yet, for months, he has made reckless, misleading comments and has unleashed efforts to make the Affordable Care Act less effective and to destabilize insurance markets.  We should resist his cynical and cruel step of singling out people who have somehow been harmed by illegal immigrants as a special category. Why not an office dealing with the far greater number of Americans whose lives are turned upside down as a result of gun violence--which, by the way, is the method of choice for homegrown terrorists who, experts in his own government point out, are responsible for more terrorist acts and violence and death of Americans than people who are foreign-born.  We should resist empty promises to rebuild and renew America by failing to provide any meaningful detail. That squanders an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation and a badly-needed effort to revitalize America and put millions of Americans to work at jobs that can't be outsourced overseas and that will strengthen each community. It is important to resist an administration program long on divisive rhetoric, misinformation, and lost opportunities.  The least popular new President in our history, as near as we can tell, has mobilized millions of Americans to be involved, to resist. It is critical that Americans of good conscience, who care about the future of their country and want to change the trajectory and tone of politics, dive in now to protect programs they care about which are under assault, to reject shortsighted policies that will spend billions of dollars on things we don't need, like even more nuclear weapons. How many times do we have to be able to blow up the world in order to achieve deterrence?  We should resist spending less on critical parts of our defense. For example, the diplomacy and international aid saves human lives; it undercuts the calls to radicalism for people without hope. Making the job of our diplomats and our aid workers harder and more dangerous and less effective should be resisted at every turn.  We should resist draconian budget cuts and hiring freezes that undercut the opportunity to take care of our veterans, especially their health. Their health is a long overdue promise that Trump has occasionally talked about but is now actively undermining.  We should resist unparalleled potential budget assaults on things that make a difference to our communities, like arts, public broadcasting, programs for children, things that matter deeply.  Together, we can resist these destructive policies in Congress, in the budget, and in legislation, while we strengthen their support for similar programs at home. Everybody should resist by being involved in their community. There is something every one of us cares about at home and on the national stage. We should resist politics of division, hatred, and hopelessly flawed and failing priorities.  We should resist. It is within our power to dramatically change the political equation. Remember, Donald Trump lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, while Democrats picked up seats in the House and the The country is much more evenly divided, and they are not united in support of this administration.  By doing our job now, it makes it possible to build on the successes by making sure everyone has a chance to participate in the voting process. Fight efforts at voter suppression.  It is time for all of us to engage in that resistance that adds energy and hope across It must start now and will continue until we defeat hate, bigotry, shortsighted policy, and misallocated priorities.  America can halt and reverse the damage that has been set in motion. We should resist. We should resist now.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1396.txt,99,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,1.0,March
9008,topic-id,513,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to H.67, which would nullify the Department of Labor rule enabling certain State political subdivisions, such as cities or counties, to establish payroll deduction retirement savings plans.  Working families across the country deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity. That is not a reality for millions of In fact, about 40 million private sector workers do not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs and are struggling to make ends meet.  Several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and are ready to implement innovative solutions that will help workers save for retirement. Municipalities are also interested in stepping up to address this challenge and help their residents save. These are people who do not have a plan currently. They want help; they need help in saving.  So in August of 2016, the Department of Labor issued its final rule providing guidance and clarity to States and private sector employees on the kind of State-based payroll deduction retirement savings programs that would not be subject to ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security  As part of that August 2016 final rule, the Department of Labor indicated that it would initiate another rulemaking process to consider whether and how to include other jurisdictions. The Department of Labor invited and considered public comment on this process.  As a result, in December of 2016, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that would allow certain localities under specific conditions to establish retirement savings programs.                              {time}  1530  To be eligible, the locality must have an authority under relevant State law; it must be larger than the least populous State, which is currently Wyoming, at approximately 600,000 residents; it must not be in a State that has already enacted a statewide payroll deduction savings plan; and it must implement and administer the plan for its workers.  Now, according to the Department of Labor's final rule, three cities, New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle, were identified as having potential interest. New York City's comptroller has noted that 57 percent of the city's private sector workers do not have access to a retirement plan at their place of employment.  This final rule just went into effect last month, and now my friends on the other side of the aisle are rushing to repeal the rule and prevent the Labor Department from issuing any substantially similar rule in the future.  Congress should be in the business of helping people save for retirement, not in the business of unfairly limiting or jeopardizing workers' ability to save for retirement; nor should Congress go out of its way to undermine the rights of cities and counties to implement innovative solutions that are needed for their residents.  I urge my colleagues to reject H.67 and get to work on meaningful solutions to address our country's retirement security crisis. America's working families deserve the opportunity to be able to save enough to retire with dignity and security.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

8959,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, when President Trump began his campaign for the White House, he made national security and, in particular, homeland security a cornerstone of his platform. His calls to secure the border to keep terrorists off U.soil and to protect our communities struck a chord with a large majority of Americans who for years felt that Washington ignored their very real concerns about our porous borders and broken immigration system.  As expected, the President moved quickly to deliver on his promises to fix this broken system. This week, the Trump administration rolled out a revised version of this Executive order aimed at restoring confidence in the procedures we have used to vet refugees fleeing from nations that are known to harbor radical and violent extremists.  The revised version appears to have benefited from the engagement of the President's Cabinet, especially the key input of Homeland Security Secretary This valuable input underscores how important it is for the President to have his team in place to govern effectively.  Senate Democrats have slowed the confirmation process at every turn. I encourage them to abandon the political games so we can quickly fill the remaining vacancies that require Senate confirmation.  It is vital that every affected agency is engaged in these types of decisions. That isn't possible if the Senate is failing to do its duty to confirm the President's nominees. Congress has many problems to tackle, but protecting our Nation is at the top of that list. That requires we work together to govern.  It also requires we take a step back from the heated rhetoric and have honest conversations. Taking the fundamental steps to protect our homeland does not diminish the fact that we are a welcoming nation that strives to help the vulnerable.  It is no secret that ISIS and other volatile extremists want to exploit our Nation's generosity and welcoming spirit to sneak terrorists onto American soil. This plan has worked well in ISIS believes it can work here as well. We can, and must, take reasonable measures to prevent that.  It is reasonable, responsible, in fact, to put a pause on accepting refugees from these nations in order to fix the flaws in the process and instill confidence in the system. The revised order removes Iraq from the list of countries. That is a move in the right direction. It shows that the Iraqis have taken the right steps in agreeing to increase their cooperation with us, and effecting positive outcomes in our relations with these nations is what this pause is all about.[[Page S1737]]  Four of the countries on this list don't even have a U.So you can understand how difficult it is to get a complete picture of the refugees seeking asylum from those countries when we don't even have a means by which to communicate.  Once the President's Executive order goes into effect, every country will be evaluated within 20 days. If a country comes up short of where it needs to be, it will have 50 days to fix the failures and communications with us.  The reasonable measures we are taking to reduce this threat in no way run counter to the ideals our Nation is built upon. We can be proud of the resources the United States has provided to support those fleeing persecution in war-torn I have visited the refugee camps we support in Jordan and Our commitment to their well-being is strong. The rhetoric doesn't match the realities when it comes to this issue.  The administration's efforts to secure our borders has been met with similar hyperbole. Again, there is nothing unreasonable about ensuring that we know who is coming into our We are a nation of immigrants and must remain welcoming to those who want to achieve the American dream. We should be proud of our record to naturalize those who immigrate here legally. We naturalize more new citizens per year than the rest of the world combined. Enforcing the law, ensuring the safety and security of our Nation, will not change our commitment to being a welcoming society to those who seek a better life.  But you can't create policies to secure our homeland while wearing rose-colored glasses. There are terrorists seeking to exploit our good graces so they can attack us here at home.

The proposal we are seeing coming out of the House of Representatives really isn't innovation.

It just has to do with basically triggering a cut to Medicaid and shifting that cost to the My concern is that we already do a lot with a lot less, and we know how to innovate.

So Medicaid equals long-term care for so many In the Affordable Care Act we accelerated the process of shifting the cost to community-based care because it is more convenient for patients and up to one-third of the cost of a nursing home. So if we keep more people in their homes, that is better innovation.  In the Affordable Care Act, we incentivized In fact, we had 21 States take us up on that--including Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Texas, Ohio, Nevada, There are many States that are doing this innovation and basically trying to move the Medicaid population to community-based care so we can save money.  Savings from rebalancing could make up for a large portion of the money the House is trying to cut in this bill. Basically, they are not saving the money. They are shifting the burden to the States, instead of giving innovative solutions to people to have community-based care; that is, long-term care services and staying in their home longer. Who doesn't want to stay in their home longer? Then we support them through community-based delivery of long-term healthcare services, and we save the Nation billions of dollars.  In fact, our State did this over a 15-year period of time, and we saved $2.7 billion. That is the kind of innovation we would like to see.

The EPA under the Obama administration was unwilling to engage the people of West Virginia in public listening sessions or hearings about decisions that directly impacted our State's economy, and I have described what the result of that has been.  This failure to effectively engage resulted in a number of job-killing regulations, like the utility MATS rule for powerplants, the so-called Clean Power Plan, and the waters of the U.rule.  As the Presiding Officer knows, the waters of the U.rule is something that impacts not just mining but also agriculture, construction, and it really has far-reaching implications.

After the hearing, Attorney General Pruitt answered 1,078 questions for the Combining both the hearing and the followup questions, Attorney General Pruitt answered more than 1,200 questions from our committees.  Through the process, Attorney General Pruitt has shown himself to be a person who cares about applying our environmental laws as they were written and intended by He has a[[Page S465]]strong record of enforcing environmental statutes in a balanced way and ensuring clean air and clean water without unnecessarily sacrificing jobs or economic growth.

It is a very tough job, as the Presiding Officer knows.                               Healthcare  What I would really like to focus on is that I want to go back in time, if I could. I want to go back to 1993. I am[[Page S1734]]not sure what the Presiding Officer was doing in 1993, but I was a brand-new Governor in 1993. We had a brand-new President and a brand-new First She was asked--I presume by her husband, or maybe she just decided on her own--to try to do what Presidents had talked about doing for a long time; that is, to try to make sure that everybody in our country had healthcare coverage. Her name was Clinton, and what she came up with, in consultation with a lot of folks, was something that was called HillaryCare--not always as a compliment, but sometimes, in some cases, derisively. I think our Republican friends, who were somewhat pointed in their criticism of it, were basically asked: Well, where is your idea?  In 1993, a guy named John Chafee, whom the Presiding Officer knows--we served with his son Lincoln in the Senate, and Lincoln went on to be Governor of Rhode Island--took up the challenge, along with at least 20 other Senators--I think mostly Republican and a couple of Democrats--and they offered legislation in 1993 that was the Republican alternative to  At the end of the day, HillaryCare did not survive, as we know, and the Chafee proposal from that time essentially went away in that particular What he had proposed had five major concepts to it. One of those was the idea that folks who didn't have healthcare coverage should be able to get their coverage in their own State--unless they were very wealthy--and to be able to get coverage in a large group plan. They called them exchanges or marketplaces, which would be established in each If that sounds familiar, it should.  They also said that folks who were going to get their coverage who didn't have coverage for healthcare in these 50 States would get some help in buying down the cost of their healthcare, and they would get that by the adoption of a sliding-scale tax credit which would buy down the cost of premiums for low-income people. The lower their income, the bigger the tax credit was; the higher the income, the lower the tax credit. And finally, it phased down.  There were concerns raised by insurance companies that it would be hard to insure folks who were going to be getting healthcare coverage on these exchanges in each of these States because a lot of these people hadn't had healthcare in a long time. There was an expectation that they would have a high demand for healthcare, they would need a lot of healthcare, and they would be a hard group to insure because their need for healthcare was very large. The insurance companies were fearful that the group of people in each of the States they would be asked to insure on the exchanges would not be insurable--not in the way in which the insurance companies could break even or make money.  This idea came along. Just to insure that we have a good mix of healthy and maybe not-so-healthy people in the exchanges to insure in each of the States, Senator Chafee and these folks came up with the idea that people would be mandated to get coverage in the States--everybody. You can't make people get coverage, but under the Chafee plan, for folks who didn't, they would have to pay a fine, and the fine, over time, would go up and become stiffer. So finally, people might say: Well, I am paying all this money for no healthcare coverage. Maybe I ought to get coverage and stop having to pay this fine. At least I would have something for my money.  The two other things in the original legislation from Senator Chafee and company were something called an employer mandate, the idea that employers were mandated to provide coverage. At least employers with a minimum number of employees would have to provide coverage--to provide a large group plan within their business or within their employment. That was the employer mandate in the Chafee proposal.  The other thing that was in Chafee, as I recall, was something like a provision that said to insurance companies: You can't just stop providing coverage for people because they have a preexisting condition; you have to insure people.  So those are the five major precipes: 1, creating exchanges in every State or marketplaces for people to get their coverage; 2, sliding-scale tax credits to help drive down the costs for low-income people for their coverage in their States; 3, individual mandates, or trying to make sure the mix of people insured was actually insurable, without the insurance companies losing an arm and a leg; 4, employer mandates that employers of a certain size have to provide coverage for their employees; and, finally, the idea of knocking people off coverage because of preexisting conditions was a no-no.  As we know, HillaryCare was not adopted, and neither was the Chafee plan. But it turned out the Chafee plan had legs, as they say in show business. It means it actually lasted beyond just being a bill introduced in the Senate in 1993.  It surfaced in Massachusetts about 10 years later, thanks to Governor Mitt Romney, who was thinking about running for Some of the people advising him said: You know, Governor, you could probably help your chances of running for President if Massachusetts could be the first State to have universal healthcare coverage for its residents. That sounded pretty enticing.  He said: How do we do this?  They looked up the Chafee bill. They apparently knew about it, thought about it, and said: Let's take the Chafee proposal and do that in  That is what they did. Guess what. They found that they did a pretty good job in terms of covering more people on the coverage side. It worked pretty well. Where it didn't work very well was on the affordability side. As we might imagine, there were the young invincibles--like some of these pages we have down here and their older brothers and sisters who maybe say: I don't need healthcare coverage. I am young and invincible. I will never get sick and go to the hospital.  They had a sliding scale. They had an individual mandate, but they had a fine people had to pay over time. Eventually, as more years went by, the young and healthy people said: I might as well get coverage. It helped provide for a better mix of folks in the exchange to provide insurance for. So they did a better job on the cost and, after a while, affordability.  When we went to work in the beginning of the Obama administration in 2009 on the Affordable Care Act, some people think Democrats just sat down in our caucus and just rolled out a plan and said: This is what we are going to do to provide healthcare coverage to people. That is not what we did. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out what we should do. We had, I want to say, dozens of hearings in the open, in public, on the Finance I am sure they had other hearings in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which shares jurisdiction with Finance on this subject. We had dozens of hearings. We actually had the head of the Congressional Budget Office come and testify.  We had a pretty good idea of what it would cost. We had a pretty good idea of what impact it would have on the Medicare trust fund. It turned out that the adoption of the Affordable Care Act extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by, I think, 12 years. It actually brought down the Federal budget deficit over the next 10 years by quite a sizeable amount, and over the 10 years after that by even more. The idea was to provide coverage for a lot of people who wouldn't have it--actually, using the Chafee plan.  I think it is really ironic, sometimes almost humorous, when my Republican friends--and they are my friends--attack the Affordable Care The piece that they attack is, I like to say, their stuff. They are the Chafee-Romney ideas.  I studied economics at Ohio State and studied some more in business school after the Vietnam war. I like market approaches to problems. So I find real virtue and interest in what Chafee came up with and what Romney put to work. Romney provided kind of a laboratory in Massachusetts to see how that idea would work--maybe not on a national scale but at least on a statewide scale, with a lot of people involved.  I am troubled by where we find ourselves today. During Presidential campaigns, I know people say things in campaigns that maybe they don't mean[[Page S1735]]or maybe they exaggerate or something like that. But I think the campaign might have been over and Donald Trump had been elected He promised, I believe shortly thereafter, that his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would lower the cost of health insurance, while providing better coverage for everyone. That is what he said. His plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would lower the cost of health insurance, while providing better coverage for everyone.  I realize that the ink is barely dry on what the two House committees--the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee--have been working on. As best we can tell at this point in time, the bill they reported out of the committees--and I presume they are going to vote in the full House pretty soon, if they haven't already--but the House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act does just the opposite of what Donald Trump called for. It does not lower the cost of health insurance, as best we can tell, and it doesn't provide better coverage for everyone. The House Republican bill to repeal the ACA does nothing to slow down the growth of healthcare costs.  One of the great virtues of the Affordable Care Act is the focus on value. How do we get better results, better healthcare outcomes, for less money? If we go back to where we were 8 years ago and compare how much we were spending in this country for healthcare as a percentage of gross domestic product, we were spending 18 percent. One of our major competitors in the world--a major ally but a major competitor--is In 2009, while we were spending 18 percent of GDP, Japan was spending 8 percent--less than half as much, 8 percent of They got better results, and they covered everybody.  So as we were approaching the debate and eventually the markup on voting on the Affordable Care Act, we had this in the back of our mind. We looked around the world to see what seemed to be working to get better results for less money, and we looked at Massachusetts to see how that was working and what we could learn from what they called RomneyCare up there.  But the House Republican bill to repeal the ACA does, as best we can tell at this point in time, very little--maybe nothing--to slow the growth of healthcare costs, and that is a shame. Apparently, fewer people will be insured. I think Standard & Poor's estimates as many as 10 million people could lose coverage under the House Republican plan. Insurance markets will destabilize faster. I mentioned earlier that a great concern insurance companies had is that they would end up in each or in a number of States with a pool of people to insure in the exchanges that were uninsurable--the elderly, maybe the sick, people who hadn't gotten healthcare for a long time. It is hard to insure that group and stay in business if you are a health insurance company. There was a concern about destabilization and instability within the markets for health insurance.  The individual mandate is replaced by something called the continuous coverage requirement. I would like to think it is going to work. I am not sure it would. But under this, I understand that people who go without a health insurance plan for more than 2 months will be charged a 30-percent surcharge when they are able to get back on and reenroll. People with expensive healthcare conditions will be willing to pay a penalty. But how about healthier people who often chose to stay out of the health insurance markets?  Also, as best we understand, in the House Republican plan, health insurance plans will become less robust, and many Americans will only be able to afford rather skimpy insurance plans. Preliminary estimates of the House GOP plan shows that insurance costs for the average person would increase by roughly $1,500. By 2020, the average person would pay $2,400 more.  I had the privilege of representing Delaware as One of the things I was responsible for in the treasurer's office was administering fringe benefits for State employees and teachers and a lot of folks. So this is something I have thought about over the years--about healthcare coverage for people.  We have only three counties--unlike Missouri, where the Presiding Officer is from, which has probably hundreds of counties--maybe not that many. But we only have three. In our southernmost county, Sussex County, we have a lot of chickens, a lot of corn, and a lot of soybeans. We have five-star beaches. A number of people like to come to Delaware to retire. We have no sales tax. We have very low property taxes in Sussex And for people who are not making a ton of money, we have pretty low personal income tax.  Take the example of a 60-year-old Delawarean in Sussex County who makes $30,000 a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, they get a tax credit. I mentioned earlier a sliding-scale tax credit. If you are lower income, it is a bigger tax credit. If you are a higher income, it finally fades out when your income goes up to a certain level. But for somebody making $30,000 a year in Sussex County, under the current law--the Affordable Care Act--the tax credit in 2020 will be about $10,000 to help buy down the cost of their coverage.  As I understand it, under the GOP health plan, for their comparable tax credit for the same person in Sussex County--which, quite frankly, has a lot of people 60, 65, 70 years old who make this amount of money down there; a lot are retired or semi-retired--the tax credit in 2020 would be $4,000. That is about $6,200 less. If you happen to be this person, you may want to think twice about which of these two paths you want to take.  We have another chart here that might be helpful. This is something we got from When we are passing legislation or drafting legislation or debating legislation, we are always interested in what key stakeholders feel. AARP is a big stakeholder. They represent a lot of people 50 and older. We are interested in hearing from folks who represent seniors. AARP represents the views of a lot--not all. We are interested in the views of those like doctors, the American Medical Association, nurses, providers. We are interested in hearing from hospitals. As it turns out--again, while the ink is barely dry on what is coming out of the House of Representatives--AARP tells us they are not very excited. Well, maybe they are excited about it, but not in a good way.  They say the change in structure will dramatically increase premiums for older consumers. That is what we have seen from the previous chart. In their example, AARP tells us about a 64-year-old person who is earning about $15,000. Their premiums go up $8,400. They are making $15,000 a year. I don't know how they pay for much of anything else with that kind of increase in their premium costs. That is a concern for me and certainly a concern for the folks at AARP and the people they represent, the millions of people they represent.  The House has come up with different names. Some call it ObamaCare light, ObamaCare 2.0 or .5. Some people call it The House is working on it. The concern we are hearing from a lot of folks is that it forces women to pay more for basic care.  Let's go back to the care for women. My wife and I have been married 31 years. I don't know everything about healthcare needs for women, but I do know this. A lot of women I have known--including my own family, my sister, my mom, and my wife's family--their primary healthcare provider is their OB/I didn't know that for a long time--not for everybody, but for a lot of people that is who their primary care provider is. For millions of women, surprisingly, their primary healthcare provider happens to be an OB/GYN or healthcare provider who works at Planned  For some people, Planned Parenthood is synonymous with abortions, but I think a very small percentage of what they do relates to abortions. What they do, for the most part, is try to make sure women get the healthcare they need, a lot of times in the OB-GYN realm but also in terms of contraception.  Somebody told me the other day that the cost of contraception for a woman in a year could be as much as $1,000. It is not cheap. The cost of a single delivery of a child from an unplanned pregnancy that is paid for by Medicaid is over $10,000, if I am not mistaken.  A lot of times, as we know, especially if a young person brings a baby into[[Page S1736]]the world, maybe doesn't finish high school or whatever, the outcome can be not that good for that child. I heard Mary Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund say these words. If a 16-year-old girl becomes pregnant, does not graduate from high school, does not marry the father of her child, there is an 80-percent likelihood they will live in poverty. The same 16-year-old girl who does not have a baby, finishes high school, graduates, waits until at least 21 to have a child, marries the father of the child, there is an 8-percent likelihood they will live in poverty. Think about that.  That suggests to me that we should--particularly for young people and those not so young who are sexually active--we want to make sure that when they are ready to bring a child into the world they can do that, a healthy child, a child with a lot of promise in their life.  For those who aren't prepared to bring that child, raise that child, prepare that child for success, contraception is needed. One of the things the Affordable Care Act does is provide access for that contraception. I am fearful the plan in the House of Representatives, however well-intentioned, will take away that opportunity for a lot of women and frankly for their children.  We have other people who have arrived on the floor. I want to be mindful of their time.  I don't know if we have another chart to look at before I yield.  We have all heard of double whammy. This has been described as TrumpCare, ObamaCare light, whatever you want to call it. It has a triple whammy. One of those is higher costs, a second is less coverage, And for some people, particularly low- and middle-income folks, more taxes. For certain people whose income is over one-quarter million dollars, they get a tax break. It adds up to quite a bit for somebody who makes a lot of money, but this is not the kind of triple whammy we ought to be supporting.  When the bill gets over here, if it gets out of the House, we will have a chance to slow down and hopefully do hearings in the light of day and bring in the folks from CBO, ask them to score this, let us know what is the real impact of what is being proposed in the Does it really save money? Does it do what President-Elect Trump said he wanted to do, which is make sure everybody gets coverage and be less expensive. Does it really do that? And we need to find out what the impact is on taxpayers. Is this the holy grail of better results for less money or is this something altogether different?  The Presiding Officer, from Missouri, is somebody who is pretty good at working across the aisle. I would like to think I am too. We have worked together on a number of issues. When you are working on something that is this big and this complex and has this kind of impact on our country, we are always better off if we can somehow fashion a bipartisan compromise and something that would have bipartisan support.  We tried to do that in the Affordable Care I know my Republican friends feel we didn't, but I was there. I know we tried. In fact, the evidence that we tried was literally the foundation for what we do for the Affordable Care Act, a Republican proposal from Senator Chafee and 20 other Republicans, including Orrin Hatch and including Chuck Grassley from I think that was a pretty good effort.  If this bill makes its way over here, we need to have at least a strong effort, maybe a better effort, maybe a more successful effort in the end.  If we are not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, actually find a way to repair it and make it better, there are things we can do. I know I can think of some--I know the Presiding Officer can as well--that would move us closer to better coverage at a more affordable price.  The last thing I would say is this. I have a Bible study group that meets here on Thursdays with Barry Black, who opens our session with a prayer every day that we are in session. We also have his Bible study group that meets for about a half an hour, 45 minutes in the Capitol--Democrats and We pray together, share things together. I describe it as the seven or eight of us who need the most help.  He is always reminding us of our obligation to the least of these. There is a passage of Scripture in Matthew 25 that a lot of us have heard of, and I am sure you have heard this in Missouri too. It says: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you get me to drink? When I was sick and imprisoned, did you visit me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in?  It doesn't say anything about when I didn't have any healthcare coverage and my only access to healthcare was an emergency room to a hospital. It doesn't say that in Matthew 25. I think the implications are clear. They are the least of these as well. They need our help, and I think we have a moral obligation, as people of faith, to help them.  We also have a fiscal imperative because while the Federal deficit is down from $1.4 trillion 6, 7, 8 years ago, down to about one-third of that, it is still high. We need to make more progress on that. We have a fiscal imperative to meet that moral imperative.  With that, I think I will call it quits.

I was just looking at what is a 2-page report that was just produced today and that I was just handed from the Center on Budget and Policy It is State specific.  In this case, looking at the data from Pennsylvania--I will not go through all of the data on Medicaid--just imagine that three different groups of Americans have benefited tremendously from the Medicaid Program every day. That is why what is happening in the House is of great concern to us.  We have in Pennsylvania, for example--just in the number of Pennsylvanians who have a disability--722,000 Pennsylvanians with disabilities who rely upon Medical Assistance for their medical care. Medical Assistance is our State program that is in partnership with There are 261,000 Pennsylvania seniors who get their healthcare through Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who happen to be over the age of 65 or who happen to have a disability of one kind or another are totally reliant, on most days, on The third group, of course, is the children, and 33 percent of all of the births in Pennsylvania are births that are paid for through  When we talk about this bill that is being considered in the House or when we talk about the confirmation vote for the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this is real life. What happens to this legislation and what happens on this nomination is about real life for people who have very little in the way of a bright future if we allow some here to do what they would like to do, apparently, to  It sounds very benign to say that you want to cap something or that you want to block-grant. They are fairly benign terms. They are devastating in their impact, and we cannot allow it to happen. That is why this debate is so critical.  I have more to say, but I do commend and salute the work by Senator Cantwell, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Wyden in fighting these battles.  I will read just portions of a letter that I received from a mom in Coatesville, in Southeast Pennsylvania, about her son, The mom's name is She wrote to us about her son, who is on the autism spectrum. In this case, she is talking about the benefits of Medicaid--Medical Assistance we call it in  Here is what she wrote in talking about the benefits that he receives. After he was enrolled in the program, she said that Rowan had the benefit of having a behavioral specialist consultant. That is one expert who was helping Rowan, who was really struggling at one point. A second professional they had helping him was a therapeutic staff support worker. So there was real expertise to help a 5-year-old child get through life with autism.  Here is what his mom Pam wrote in talking about, since he was enrolled, how much he has benefited and how much he has grown and progressed:       He benefited immensely from the CREATE program by the Child      Guidance Resource Centers, [which is a local program in      Coatesville]. Thankfully, it is covered in full by  She goes on to write the following, and I will conclude with this:       Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full time      to support our family. We would be bankrupt, and my son would      go without the therapies he sincerely needs.  Here is how Pam concludes the letter. She asks me, as her representative--as her Senator--to think about her and her family when we are deliberating about a nomination like this and about healthcare legislation.  She writes:       Please think of us when you are making these decisions.      Please think about my 9-month-old daughter, Luna, who smiles      and laughs at her brother, Rowan, daily. She will have to      care for Rowan later in life after we are gone. Overall, we      are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and      would be devastated if we lost these benefits.  This is real life for people. Sometimes it is far too easy here in Washington for people to debate as if these things are theoretical--that if you just cut a program or cap a program or block-grant a program, you are just kind of moving numbers around and moving policy around. This is of great consequence to these families, and we have to remember that when we are making decisions around here.  Everyone who works in this building as an employee of the Federal Government gets healthcare. We do not have someone else around the country who is debating whether or not we are going to have healthcare, like those families on Medicaid are having to endure.  I thank the Senator from I know that Senator Stabenow from Michigan may have more to add on this. We have a big battle ahead, but this is a battle that is not only worth fighting, but it is absolutely essential that we win the battle to protect and support  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1714.txt,1828,FORT ONTARIO STUDY ACT,2017.0,9.0,March

But in recent decades, millions of these jobs have disappeared. Factories have been shuttered. Bad trade deals have moved American jobs to other countries.

This is a commonsense bill that incentivizes communities, together with the private sector, higher education, and other key stakeholders to work together to strengthen their manufacturing economies. It provides targeted investments and support to make regions and local communities competitive in manufacturing again--communities like those in my home State of Rhode Island, the birthplace of the American industrial revolution.

8914,topic-id,791,"Madam President, this week the Senate continues to press forward on a number of congressional review actions; in this case, a disapproval that will roll back and repeal many Obama-era regulations that have hurt people across the country and strangled our economic growth.  By doing away with excessively burdensome rules and regulations, we are delivering on our promise to the American people to actually do what we can to help the economy, to grow the economy, to create jobs and not hurt it with unnecessary, expensive, and burdensome redtape.  Earlier this year, we began the legislative process to deliver on our biggest promise: repealing and replacing ObamaCare with more affordable and more accessible healthcare options, options that will work for all American families. The American Health Care Act, introduced in the House on Monday, is the first step in fulfilling that promise.  ObamaCare is collapsing. It has already failed countless families across the country, and it has forced people off good insurance plans they liked and strong-armed them to sign up for plans that were more expensive, offered less care, and didn't even let them use the doctor of their choice. So we would be revisiting healthcare even if Hillary Clinton had been elected President of the United States because ObamaCare is in a meltdown mode.  ObamaCare has also saddled our economy with more than a trillion dollars in new taxes. Most of those taxes are so hidden that most Americans are probably not aware of the fact that there is even a tax charged on the premium for their health insurance policy, for example. Well, all of these taxes end up being absorbed and have to be paid by American families.  At its very core, the individual mandate of ObamaCare was a major power play and overreach by the Federal Basically, what it said was, if you don't buy the government-prescribed health insurance plan, we are going to fine you; we are going to penalize you.  The government should not be able to force anyone to spend their own hard-earned money for something they don't want but have to buy under a threat of financial penalty. The American people have spoken up loudly and clearly and rightfully demanded that Congress do better, and we will.  Since the 2010 timeframe--when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle passed ObamaCare with 60 votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and with the White House--they have lost the majority in the Senate, they have lost the majority in the House, and they have lost the White I think ObamaCare has been one of the major reasons why, because people, the more they learn about it, the less they like it, and they don't appreciate Washington forcing them to do things they don't want to do with their own money.  About 2 months ago, one of my constituents in Texas wrote me about her skyrocketing healthcare costs. Before last year, her premium was about $325 a month. A short time later, that was revised to $436 a month. This same Texan later moved from one city to another and, because of her change of address, her premium jumped to $625 a month. It started at $325 and is now $625. In 2017, thanks to ObamaCare, her premium went up again to an astronomical $820 a month. It started at $325 before ObamaCare and is now $820 a month. I don't know many people who could absorb that kind of increase in their healthcare insurance premium.  In about a year, her monthly healthcare payment jumped by more[[Page S1715]]than 150 percent--150 percent. That is hardly what I would call affordable; thus, the misnamed Affordable Care Act should be the un-Affordable Care  To make matters worse, she then found that her provider would be putting a halt to individual plans in Texas, something that has been a recurring theme in my State and across the country. So while President Obama said: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, as a result of ObamaCare, she was not able to keep her plan so she had to find a new plan and a new doctor, a plan ultimately with less care, less flexibility, and even a higher price.  Suffice it to say, for this constituent of mine and for millions more like her, ObamaCare is not working. ObamaCare is not affordable, and it is hurting It is time for Congress to keep its promise that we have made in every election since that given the privilege of governing--of being in the majority, being in a position to change things--we would repeal and replace ObamaCare with options that fit the needs of all Americans and their families at a price they can afford.

8916,topic-id,629,"I will not, not at this time.  Fortunately, we now have a President in the White House who clearly sees the failure of ObamaCare and wants to do something about it. Republicans in Congress have introduced a bill, which is now being marked up in the House, that the President can actually sign, once it is passed, to get us out of this mess. The American Health Care Act is the vehicle to do just that, and I am glad President Trump endorsed the plan earlier this week.  It is a work in progress. The House committees are marking it up as we speak. There will be changes along the way, but, ultimately, the House will pass the bill and send it to the Then we will have an opportunity to offer our amendments during the course of its passage. The important point to make, though, is that this legislation will actually put patients first so they are not forced into a plan that they don't want or that provides coverage they can't afford. It does away with the outrageous new taxes and the penalties that have made the economy worse off and have made life harder for American families.  The legislation will also give families more flexibility so they can get the healthcare specific to their needs that actually works for them. If they decide, for example, to get a major medical policy that is relatively inexpensive and then use a health savings account to use pretax dollars to pay for their regular doctors' visits, they will have the flexibility to do that. So this legislation promotes sensible reforms to ensure that big ticket items like Medicaid are put on a more sustainable fiscal path.  I have heard some suggestions that this legislation actually guts That is false. That is not true. It actually continues at current levels in this shared State and Federal program, but it is subject to a cost-of-living index that will actually put Medicaid on a more sustainable path. Just as importantly, it will also return the authority back to the States to come up with the flexible programs they need to deal with the specific healthcare needs of the people of their  This legislation makes sure that Medicaid doesn't lose sight of its design, which is to serve the most vulnerable among us who can't afford access to quality healthcare. It provides them that access--and better access--by providing flexibility to the  We know that the States and the Federal Government spend an awful lot of money on In Texas, for example, my State spent close to one-third of its budget on Medicaid last year--one-third of all State spending--and it is uncapped, so it goes up every year by leaps and bounds. Under the American Health Care Act, Medicaid will be tied to the number of people in the State using it, a per capita rate, which makes sense, and it represents the first major overhaul of the program in decades.  ObamaCare left us with unchecked government spending, more taxes, and fewer healthcare options. This bill is the opposite of ObamaCare in every way. It will control spending in a commonsense way, it will repeal ObamaCare's taxes and the individual and employer mandate, and it will provide more flexible free market options for families across the country. That is not just a bumper sticker or advertisement; that is actually what is contained in the legislation.

8877,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, perhaps the most powerful moment on Inauguration Day when the President gave his speech was when he reminded his supporters and the people who were assembled there that there were too many in America who were forgotten by the Federal Government; and that it was his promise that he would, in fact, remember them in terms of how he developed policies and programs during his time as It is a message which obviously he used quite effectively on the campaign trail. I think personally it is what propelled him into the White  Fast forward to where we are today, Mr.It is hard to really square that rhetoric with the budget, which was submitted a couple of weeks ago by the Trump administration. The one agency which probably has the closest connection to rural America, that part of the country which he was addressing in his comments on Inauguration Day, the U.Department of Agriculture, was cut by 20 percent in terms of what came over from the White  Again, that was the third largest hit of any Federal agency of the entire Federal Government, the U.Department of It does so much in terms of helping farmers, small town America, and rural America in terms of dealing with the challenges which, again, I think, were just a huge, powerful undercurrent in last November's election.  In particular, the budget proposes eliminating completely the USDA Rural Development for drinking water and wastewater programs, which, again, for so many communities, is desperately needed.  Again, the property tax base of small town and rural towns across the country really cannot, by themselves, pay for sewer plants, pay for drinking water upgrades. I know because I come from one of those districts.  Even in Connecticut, the eastern half of the State, the Second Congressional District is small town, rural America for which the USDA Rural Development programs have been the lifeblood of making sure that community facilities and, again, a decent quality of life are possible.  So, for example, in towns like Vernon, Connecticut, where I am from, the Bolton Lake sewer plant was just finished a couple of years ago through USDA Rural In the town of Putnam, $28 million over just the last couple of years, they just built a new fire station, the north Putnam fire station, with USDA Rural  Stafford, Connecticut, there was a sewer plant upgrade. Windham, Connecticut, there was a new community health facility, which was a community facilities program, through USDA Rural There were projects in Thompson, Connecticut, $2.4 million for water and sewer; Brooklyn, Connecticut, $1.3; Killingly, and the list goes on and on.  This budget, let's be clear, doesn't just give this program a little haircut or tailor it back. It eliminates it. It eviscerates this type of help which, again, rural communities, with their own resources, are incapable of accomplishing on their own.  Mr.Speaker, a budget is more than just a collection of numbers. It is a statement of your priorities. It is about what is important to you as an executive or as a legislator, and this budget fails that test for rural America, for the forgotten Americans which the President addressed on Inauguration  I am confident that, in this Chamber, there is potential for a bipartisan group of Members to push back on this type of really just backwards budgeting and backwards priority.  Again, in terms of what my father told me a long time ago: Talk is cheap. Put your money where your mouth is. Put your budget where your rhetoric is.  On that score, this administration has failed that test. It has also failed it with the Sea Grant program for fishermen in Again, 90 percent of seafood that is consumed in this country is from overseas.  Even though we are a great maritime country, the Sea Grant program helps[[Page H2604]]fishermen deal with all the complexity of the maritime domain in terms of regulations. I have seen it in  Again, my district borders on Long Island We have seen shellfish growers coming back to life because of the Sea Grant program administered through the University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus that has given these really hardworking, inspiring entrepreneurs the tools that they need to again give America a domestic seafood industry. It is just ridiculous when you look at the disproportion of imported seafood that is consumed on the tables of Americans all across the country.  Later today, 100 House Members, on a bipartisan basis, will be releasing a letter of support for the Sea Grant program. Congressman Zeldin, Republican from Long Island, and myself led that letter. Again, this is where our focus ought to be in terms of this country.  If you really care about making America great again, it is about giving people out there in the great heartland and in the coastal sections of this country the tools that they need to grow, thrive, innovate, and succeed. This budget fails that test.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgH2603-4.txt,1836,WOMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON,2017.0,3.0,March
9011,topic-id,545,"Mr.Speaker, sweetheart deals?  Since when is it a sweetheart deal to have a modicum of retirement for working poor and middle class people?  That is a sweetheart deal?  All I hear from the other side of the aisle is people talking about government overreach, executive orders, and unnamed bureaucrats. So it is surprising that today the Republican majority is creating a manmade roadblock toward helping working Americans save their own money for their own retirement.  We have all heard about the olden days when, if you worked for a company for life, you could retire with a guaranteed pension. Now, with the exception of union workers, the days of a guaranteed pension plan for most private sector workers are a thing of the past. Captains of industry don't offer them anymore. They line their own pockets instead.  Some employers have tried to fill that retirement income gap by offering 401(k) retirement savings plans. Not a bad thing, but it was not the answer that everyone thought it was going to be, the panacea that everyone made it out to be.  But for far too many companies, they don't offer any retirement package to their employees at all. Today, half of all Americans going to work are not offered a retirement plan from their employer, meaning these workers are not accumulating any nest egg outside of Social Security for their retirement years.  To address this growing retirement savings crisis, the Obama administration made it easier for States and large municipalities to sponsor their own 401(k)-style retirement plan for their residents who work in the private sector, but are not offered any retirement plan from their private sector job. They are not offered by their employer that 401(k) plan. They have nothing, no opportunity.  These rules do not require employees to participate, so the captains of industry who don't offer their employees a retirement plan, under the Obama administration rules, would not even have to participate. These rules do not require any employer contributions.  What these rules simply do is create a pathway for States and large cities, if they choose, to enroll private sector workers into a retirement savings vehicle so they can start saving early to enjoy the benefits of a more financially secure retirement. And what is wrong with that?  It is a universal fact that the most successful way to get people to save for their retirement is to enroll them in a retirement plan through their workplace and have a percentage of their pay taken out automatically and invested for the long-term future and for their benefit.  So these Obama administration rules were actually adopting best practices to help workers who had been offered no opportunity to save for their retirement, to start to build their own nest egg with their own money for their own future, potentially even investing in a private 401(k) plan down the road.  The cruel irony is, if these two bills pass, congressional Republicans will have prohibited States and local governments from trying to help those workers who have been forgotten about by some in the Federal Government and ignored by the private sector marketplace.  What ever happened to local government being the laboratory of democracy?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

That is not just in New York City, that is throughout our entire country, but particularly in my home city and my home State, and that is a savings and retirement security crisis in  The word ``crisis'' is no exaggeration, Mr.Nearly half of U.households do not have a savings plan. Less than one-third have a cushion to cover basic expenses for just 3 months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income.  The status for retirement savings is even more dire, Mr.Remember, one out of every two Americans going to work today doesn't have a retirement plan provided by their employer. We are seeing a new generation of Americans growing up with little or no savings to help them climb the economic ladder or simply weather a difficult time.  Younger workers are trying to save for their children to go to college. They are trying to buy a home or build the emergency fund they will need if their car breaks down. Others are wondering if they can afford to start their own business or have the financial security to leave their job for a better opportunity. Older Americans are looking at retirement and if they will be able to support themselves and maintain a good quality of life without working. We know that savings are the path for middle class families to achieve the American Dream, yet that dream is increasingly being put at risk.  We can turn this around, Mr.We can put building a college savings account, a nest egg, and a retirement plan back in reach for millions of American families.  That is why I have put forward a plan of action entitled ``Building Better Savings, Building Brighter Futures.'' You can read my action plan on my website at crowley.house.gov.  This plan is a comprehensive approach to ensure no American who works their whole life will spend their retirement in poverty. But to get to that point, we need to stop wasting time going backwards. So let's allow States and local governments to continue to do what they are doing to help those workers who are being left behind now.

8810,topic-id,245,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to talk about Welfare BRAC, an opportunity to reorganize our 92 social safety net programs.  Mr.Speaker, I call attention to the 92 programs that, over time, since the Great Society, our country has launched. I call attention to Ronald Reagan's prescient quote about the near eternity of government programs. It is very hard to take a program away once it is launched, and this plan acts on The Brookings Institution's data, which has rarely been accused of being on the right side of the political ideology.  It says that if we do three things, we will eliminate 80 percent of poverty: graduate high school, work full-time at any wage, and have no kids outside of marriage.  This program that I am proposing in this bill, H.1469, the Welfare Benefit Reform and Alignment Commission, would nominate four Republicans and four They would have 1 year to work together until September 30, 2018, to prioritize not taking any money away, but taking the 92 programs and making them fewer.

If passed, H.67 will nullify a Department of Labor rule, just 1 month after it went into effect, that supports the efforts of large cities or counties, like New York City, in establishing retirement savings plans for their residents.  This rule is narrowly applied to jurisdictions that are populous enough to be their own State and whose States do not already have provided statewide payroll deduction saving plans. This is to ensure that the policy only goes into effect in cities where the people are in real need.  In New York City alone, 1.5 million private sector workers--almost 60 percent of the private sector workers throughout the city--do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer or business.                              {time}  1545  This rule gives New York City the ability to expand access for private sector workers to retirement savings plans.

8980,topic-id,426,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to start by saying that, for the last 25 years, I practiced dentistry in Georgia's Third District and I experienced a healthcare system that was broken and in desperate need of repair to reduce costs and increase access to care.  After the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, I saw my patients, my friends, my neighbors forced away from doctors who had treated them for their entire lives. Instead of decreasing costs, patients saw their costs skyrocket and their access to care limited.  As a medical practitioner, I want what is best for my patients. Those are the people that I am fighting for: my neighbors and constituents who saw their premiums skyrocket, their quality and access to care limited or determined by a government bureaucrat. I committed to them that I would repeal ObamaCare and undo the damage that it has done to our healthcare system.  The legislation we are currently considering in the House, the American Health Care Act, is just the beginning of keeping that promise.  This is not a choice between a broken healthcare system that existed before It is a new direction that reflects an understanding of what works and what does not work. The legislation will enact many reforms that directly impact Americans by lowering costs and improving access to care.  Tonight, my colleagues and I are going to share with you in great detail what that legislation does. We have all been very open in our opposition to the Affordable Care Act, but it is also important that we share with our constituents what we stand for and what we are working to do to reform this broken system.  We stand for patient-centered health care that meets the needs of our constituents in an affordable way. We stand for market-driven healthcare solutions and an industry that prioritizes personal freedom over government mandates. We stand for the biggest entitlement reform in a generation to ensure that we protect our most vulnerable populations.

One that he talked about was the process here, that this is just the beginning of a long journey that we must take to rebuild our American healthcare system.  This has been an open legislative process. More than 8 months ago, even before I was a Member of this great House, the Republican caucus here released A Better Way agenda, which detailed a consensus vision for patient-centered healthcare reform. Our bill, the American Health Care Act, is built on that framework.  These ideas are not new. They are not unvetted. They are a product of many conversations, debates, and work.

Truly, when the patient is in control of their health care, they are also in control of the cost. We are fighting for consumer choice in a patient-driven healthcare system. We understand, and I certainly understand, that patients and doctors need to be at the center of the healthcare conversation, not bureaucrats and not insurance clerks.  Our plan includes provisions to expand choice and give consumers more control over their healthcare dollars. The American Health Care Act significantly increases the amount individuals and families can contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year, allowing them to save more to pay for future healthcare expenses and the flexibility to use their healthcare dollars as they choose.  It also allows them to spend those healthcare dollars where they think that it will best benefit their families. It allows them to have the most intimate conversations with their healthcare providers and make sure that they are making the right decisions and using their dollars wisely. If the first question always is ``does my insurance company pay for it?'' you are always going to get the most expensive answer. However, if the patient has contributed to this process, the patient then will be able to make some informed decisions through good conversations with their doctors, and they can better manage their own health care.  We are fighting for a system that puts patients first and allows Georgians in the Third District and all across this Nation to make their own healthcare decisions. That starts with a conversation between the doctor and the patient.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Rutherford). He is a former three-term sheriff from Florida, representing the greater Jacksonville area.  ",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,99999999999999,HEALTHCARE REFORM,2017.0,15.0,January
8986,topic-id,809,"Mr.Speaker, my colleague from Florida touched on something that is very important, and that is fairness in the marketplace. I can tell you, as a small-business owner, I did not receive the same favorable tax treatment as the major corporations did under the Affordable Care Once this bill took effect, I had to move into the individual market. I had to begin buying health insurance with post-tax dollars, and I was unable to afford the coverage not only for my family, but for the people that I had the pleasure of working with every single day in my business.  What Mr.Rutherford talked about is leveling the playing field, and that is something that we need to do. It will increase innovation. It increases jobs. It increases success. It is so frustrating for Americans as they begin to build their small businesses and they begin to grow, and every single time that they take a step forward, the government takes more and more out of their pocket. Now we have a healthcare system that continues to rob them of their success.  Make no mistake; the healthcare system that we had prior to the Affordable Care Act was certainly not successful and not headed in the right way, but we have made it worse with this. What we have done is we have not only disenfranchised many small businesses and people who are growing their businesses and finding success, but we have also, quite candidly, done a poor job of maintaining our safety net. What we are fighting for is to increase affordable health care for all Americans, and this has meant listening to a lot of the feedback from our families and our constituents back home.  What we need to recognize is that, under our plan, dependents can continue to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26 and they are fully on their feet, if that is the right thing for their families to do. Americans told us that they like this flexibility, and we have listened to them.  Our plan will also ensure that those who have preexisting conditions can't be charged more for the health coverage they need. It also includes incentives, not mandates, to encourage Americans to have continuous coverage. This is good for the marketplace, and it will keep costs down for all Our portable tax credits will also increase access to coverage by assisting lower income individuals to purchase the health insurance that they need.  What is more, the American Health Care Act includes a Patient and State Stability Fund to help States expand the number of vulnerable patients who have access to health care. We know that States know how to best meet the unique needs of their citizens, and this is going to give them the flexibility to do that. Therefore, as these funds are flexible, they allow things like cutting out-of-pocket expenses for patients, promoting access to preventive services, or increasing available options in the marketplace--all things that are needed.                              {time}  2030  These reforms will help drive down costs and increase access to care. This is good news for patients who are worried about affordable coverage. Unlike ObamaCare, though, it means that their coverage provides them with meaningful access to care.  It does you no good to have an insurance plan that you cannot afford to use. Time and time again, I have patients, I have small-business owners, I have constituents from all over Georgia's Third District that come to me and say: Just because I have this new insurance plan doesn't mean that my family is getting better care.  One such example was a gentleman that came into my district office just this past week. Three years ago, his health insurance for his family with four children was about $900, and he had a $3,000 family deductible. Last year, his premium had risen to $1,700 a month. And this year, he laid in front of me on my desk in the district office a bill for his health insurance that was $2,400 a month, and a $7,000 deductible. He is a small-business owner with nine employees. It is absolutely crushing his family expenses, and that is not fair.  What we have done is we have created an environment where we have tried unsuccessfully to expand access; and in doing so, we have risen costs on men and women across this Nation that are trying to do their best to move into the middle class. We have seen it destroy family finances. We have seen it create a situation where many families now pay more for their health insurance than they do for their own homes.  Mr.Speaker, in my case, that is the exact same thing. My insurance payment is more than my house payment, and that simply doesn't seem right.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,99999999999999,HEALTHCARE REFORM,2017.0,15.0,January
8988,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for her very candid remarks. As you can see, she touched on many important issues--the unfairness of the system that we have now, but also the importance of protecting our Medicaid safety net.  What we have seen under the Affordable Care Act is that we have seen our safety nets eroded. We are diverting resources away from the people that need them the most--the poor, the elderly, the blind, the disabled, children, and pregnant women--and we are pushing those resources to able-bodied men and women who do have the ability to work.  It is important to recognize that our legislation is probably the largest entitlement reform program in a generation. Our legislation puts Medicaid back on a budget for the first time in history. It provides enhanced flexibility to the States to allow them to design effective and financially sound programs to meet their population's unique needs.  Our plan also ensures that Medicaid prioritizes care for the most vulnerable, who it was originally intended for. We must do this because there are so many Americans, unfortunately, that have to depend on this safety net for their health care.  I understand this. In my hometown, in my dental practice, I treated patients who relied on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. It was an honor to take care of them and to have very real discussions about their healthcare needs. I understand this vulnerable population because they were a vital part of my practice, and it was truly my pleasure to take care of them. I understand the unique circumstances that cause many of these individuals to be on Medicaid and to need this valuable safety net.  But we have to have an honest conversation about that. We have to be able to provide that safety net. And as we put more and more able-bodied men and women without children on that safety net, it is diverting resources away from those that need it the most. That is not right and that is not the American way. We are fighting to protect and strengthen this Nation's healthcare safety net.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.Marshall). Marshall knows firsthand about health care. He was a practicing OB/GYN, a board chairman of a hospital, and he has served our Nation in the United States  ",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,99999999999999,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS,2017.0,15.0,January
8990,topic-id,714,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Marshall for his strong remarks and pointing out and highlighting several important things.  You know, one of the biggest things that we are fighting for as part of repealing ObamaCare is that we are fighting for our personal freedom. Right now, Americans have the ``choice'' of purchasing a government-mandated, one-size-fits-all product or paying a government-mandated penalty. In almost a third of all U.counties, and many in my home State of Georgia, consumers don't even have the choice between insurances to purchase. This is not a choice.  With the passage of the American Health Care Act, no longer will the Federal Government mandate that Americans purchase a product that they don't want, because we believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices. We understand the unique dignity of every human being. This dignity calls for self-determination and personal freedom, and we are fighting for that freedom. It is important.  I want to thank all of my colleagues who have joined me tonight to share with our constituents more about what we are fighting for.  First off, our legislation promotes personal freedom by eliminating the individual and employer mandates. Purchasing decisions should be left up to the consumer, not the Federal Under our plan, no American is mandated to purchase a product that he or she does not want and cannot afford.  As I have shared, I have personal experience with how important the conversation between the patient and their doctor is. By almost doubling the cap on how much individuals can contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year and expanding where those dollars can be used, our plan puts patients back at the center of the conversation with their doctor, and they remove all of the government bureaucrats from the middle of that conversation.  Health care is personal. It should belong to the patient and their healthcare provider--and no one else. That is where the most important decisions are made.  We are also working to strengthen our safety net to ensure that our vulnerable populations have continued access to health care. Our plan returns power to the States with the biggest entitlement reform in a generation. Our legislation also protects Americans with preexisting conditions, ensuring that no one is unable to purchase insurance because of an illness.  ObamaCare is a complex tangle of regulations and Federal overreach. With every day that passes, Americans and businesses feel the growing weight of a healthcare system that is failing. But it is also irresponsible to return to a broken healthcare system that brought us  Tomorrow, we will take the next step in the open legislative process as my colleagues and I on the Budget Committee do our part to send the American Health Care Act to the floor of the House for a vote. I am excited to take this step, but I want to be clear that this is only one part of repeal and reform. We are doing all that we can, and we are going to continue to push for conservative solutions with this bill. But it is not the final vote that we will take. There are many steps to go.  While it will take time and patience, I made a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and improve our healthcare system for all I am committed to this difficult road of building this healthcare system that puts patients first. The American people deserve the hard work and political will it will take to do this the right way.  Mr.Speaker, I am honored to have been joined by my colleagues tonight and glad to hear their comments, and I know that you have been as well. I want to point out that my colleagues have done an outstanding job tonight, and I believe that they have made some very, very salient points, and articulated reasons why we must step forward and do all that we can to reform our American healthcare system.  We have to control the cost. We have to do the things necessary to put patients back in control. And, Mr.Speaker, I have confidence that this body, along with our President and our colleagues in the Senate, can do that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,99999999999999,A CENTURY OF SUCCESS,2017.0,15.0,January

As I have come to the floor and talked about before, Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is the U.circuit court that is housed in Denver, It is the circuit court that oversees about 20 percent of the land mass in the States of Colorado, Oklahoma, and places in between.

He was so popular and so well supported that there was not even a rollcall vote taken in this It was a simple acclamation by a voice vote. In fact, Gorsuch's nomination hearing was deemed so noncontroversial that the last time, Senator Graham was the only committee member to attend.  One may ask oneself what made and continues to make Judge Gorsuch such a mainstream nominee. I do not think we need to look any further than his original Judiciary Committee questionnaire to see that Judge Gorsuch possesses the right temperament and the right view of the role of judges.  I thought it was important that I read this from 11 years ago when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit The questionnaire he filled out for the Judiciary Committee included then-Neil Gorsuch's--trying to be Judge Gorsuch--response to judicial activism and what it meant to Neil Gorsuch prior to his confirmation to the Tenth Circuit  Here is what he replied to the Judiciary Committee in that committee questionnaire:       The Constitution requires Federal judges to strike a      delicate balance. The separation of powers embodied in our      founding document provides the judiciary with a defined and      limited charter.       Judges must allow the elected branches of government to      flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives,      to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of      the day.       Judges must avoid the temptation to usurp the roles of the      legislative and executive branches and must appreciate the      advantages these democratic institutions have in crafting and      adapting social policy as well as their special authority,      derived from the consent and mandate of the people, to do so.       At the same time, the Founders were anxious to ensure that      the judicial branch never becomes captured by or subservient      to the other branches of government, recognizing[[Page S1717]]     that a firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-     functioning democracy.       The Constitution imposes on the judiciary the vital work of      settling disputes, vindicating civil rights and civil      liberties, ensuring equal treatment under the law, and      helping to make real for all citizens the Constitution's      promise of self-government. There may be no firmly fixed      formula on how to strike the balance envisioned by the      Constitution in specific cases, but there are many guideposts      discernible in the best traditions of our judiciary.       A wise judge recognizes that his or her own judgment is      only a weak reed without being fortified by these proven      guides.       For example, a good judge recognizes that many of the      lawyers in cases reaching the court of appeals have lived      with and thought deeply about the legal issues before the      court for months or years. A lawyer in the well is not to be      treated as a cat's paw but as a valuable colleague whose      thinking is to be mined and tested and who, at all times,      deserves to be treated with respect and common courtesy.       A good judge will diligently study counsels' briefs and the      record and seek to digest them fully before argument and then      listen with respectful discernment to the arguments made by      his or her colleagues at the bar.       A good judge will recognize that few questions in the law      are truly novel, that precedents in the vast body of Federal      law reflect the considered judgment of those who have come      before us and embody the settled expectation of those in our      own generation.       A good judge will seek to honor precedent and strive to      avoid its disparagement or displacement.       A good judge will listen to his or her colleagues and      strive to reach consensus with them. Every judge takes the      same judicial oath; every judge brings a different and      valuable perspective to the office.       A good judge will appreciate the different experiences and      perspectives of his or her colleagues and know that reaching      consensus is not always easy but that the process of getting      there often tempers the ultimate result, ensuring that the      ultimate decision reflects the collective wisdom of multiple      individuals of disparate backgrounds who have studied the      issue with care.       Throughout the process of adjudicating an appeal, a good      judge will question not only the positions espoused by the      litigants but also his or her own perceptions and      tentative conclusions as they evolve.       And a good judge will critically examine his or her own      ideas as readily and openly as the ideas advanced by others.       A good judge will never become so wedded to any view of any      case so as to preclude the possibility of changing his or her      mind at any stage--from argument through the completion of a      written opinion.       Pride of position, fear of embarrassment associated with      changing one's mind, along, of course, with personal politics      or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular      and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's      own abilities and conclusions always do.  This is the response that then-Neil Gorsuch, prior to his becoming Judge Gorsuch, gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee and in response to a questionnaire about judicial activism and about what makes a good judge in his talking about fidelity to precedent, talking about the ability to reach a conclusion that may be in disagreement with one's own personal opinions, making sure that we respect the different branches of government, making sure that one listens to one's colleagues who are arguing a case and who have spent years in their getting to know the case and its every detail, and scrubbing your mind to question the positions that you thought you had to make sure that they mesh with the law, not with opinion.  Judge Gorsuch, when he was introduced at the White House when being nominated by the President, said that a judge who agrees with every opinion he reaches is probably a bad judge.  The institution we serve has that fidelity to the Constitution that we must preserve, that we must guard. Guardians of the Constitution, which judges represent, is something we confirm. It is our job to make sure the kind of judges we place on courts represent the kind of judge Neil Gorsuch truly is.  It is this temperament, this fidelity to the Constitution, this appropriate temperament, and remarkable humility that has made Judge Gorsuch a consensus pick in the past and, I believe, that could be a consensus pick in the near future.  It is reflected in the fact that, on February 23, Senator Bennet and I, along with the Judiciary Committee, received a letter from Colorado's diverse legal community in support of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  The letter reads as follows:       As members of the Colorado legal community, we are proud to      support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next      Supreme Court We hold a diverse set of political      views as Republicans, Democrats, and Many of us      have been critical of actions taken by President      Nonetheless, we all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally      well qualified to join the Supreme He deserves an up-     or-down vote.

In the mid-     nineties, we were counsel together in successfully      representing co-defendants in a major securities matter      involving class action and derivative lawsuits in several      jurisdictions across the country as well as SEC and      Congressional investigations. Over the course of that complex      representation in the following years, I came to observe      first-hand his considerable lawyering skills, intellect,      judgment and temperament. He was one of the finest trial      lawyers with whom it has been my pleasure to be associated in      my career. We also became personal and good friends which      continued during the following years at his firm, later      during his time at the Department of Justice and since      returning to Denver to serve on the bench.       I was delighted by his appointment to the U.Court of      Appeals for the Tenth Circuit based here in (He      honored me by having me be one of two lawyers to introduce      him to the court at his formal investiture.) Over his years      of service on that court, he has distinguished himself with      his work ethic, keen and thorough understanding of the case      under review, his formidable analytical ability, and the      clarity of his opinions. I have read many of his opinions and      watched him in oral argument. He is engaging, courteous to      counsel and demonstrates a full and unusual appreciation for      the human impact of his decisions on the people involved.      These are the qualities of an outstanding jurist.       Judge Gorsuch has been active and an important voice in the      legal community and academy. He has written extensively,      lectured and taught in continuing legal education seminars      and served on the important federal Rules Committee, among      others. He also has found time to sit on student moot courts      and teach both ethics and federal jurisdiction at the      University of Colorado Law He is regularly regarded      by his students as one of their very best law professors--     effective, challenging and personable.

In Puerto Rico, they want one reality and in the Congress they pretend there is another.  No, with my bill we have balance, truth and transparency. This is democracy.

The Puerto Rican is his diaspora, from New York to Chicago, San Juan to Ponce, we are all Puerto As our national poet, Juan Antonio Corretjer, wrote: ``I would be Puerto Rican even if I were born on the moon.'' To which I would add, with a great deal of respect, ``I would be Puerto Rican, even if I lived on the moon.''  Senor presidente: Voy a hablar en espanol, el vernaculo de los puertorriquenos porque la democracia exige transparencia y claridad.  La esencia del debate acerca del futuro de Puerto Rico es la diferencia entre el asimilismo, representado por el proyecto presentado por Jenniffer Gonzalez, y el que yo presente.  Yo nunca he excluido la estadidad. Los asimilistas han excluido la independencia y la libre asociacion.  Lo que hace mi proyecto es sencillamente traer balance, corregir un desequilibrio.  De aqui en adelante, el debate es entre los lideres asimilistas y el pueblo, los puertorriquenistas. La asimilacion ya no es la unica opcion ante el  Mi proyecto propone la libre asociacion y la independencia. Eso es lo que proponen los puertorriquenistas.  qQue nos motiva a los puertorriquenistas? El amor a Puerto Rico; defender su herencia; creen que podemos ser autosuficientes; creen que podemos determinar nuestro futuro sin tener amos; creen en si mismos. Estan convencidos que podemos crear empleos, con una economia fuerte y vibrante de un pueblo innovador, creativo, y totalmente capaz de determinar su propio futuro.  Los lideres asimilistas piensan que nos morimos de hambre sin los Estados  Los puertorriquenistas no macanean a los estudiantes cuando levantan su voz en defensa de la democracia--eso lo hacen los lideres asimilistas.  Los puertorriquenistas creen que primero hay que pagar las pensiones al pueblo mientras los asimilistas prefieren pagar los bonistas norteamericanos de Wall  Los puertorriquenistas aman y protegen su tierra. Los asimilistas quieren destruirla construyendo un gasoducto.  Los puertorriquenistas entienden que la democracia debe florecer. La libre expresion del pueblo es sagrada. Los lideres asimilistas, cuando no les gusta lo que escuchan del pueblo, llaman a la fuerza de choque.  Los lideres asimilistas no han atacado lo que propone mi proyecto. Ellos atacan al proponente.  Los asimilistas quieren que los congresistas solamente escucharan su version del futuro. Estan molestos porque este congresista ha traido antes el Congreso las otras dos alternativas, que de hecho, se van a votar en el plebiscito de Puerto En Puerto Rico quieren una realidad, y los asimilistas en el Congreso quieren pretender que hay otra.  No, con mi proyecto, aqui va a haber balance, verdad y transparencia: esa es la democracia, en eso creemos los puertorriquenistas--el debate, la discusion y la libertad de ideas. Los lideres asimilistas, a traves de la historia han perseguido y metido a los puertorriquenistas en la carcel, y si no en la carcel, los llevan hasta Cerro  Los asimilistas dicen que los puertorriquenistas son antiamericanos. No y no. Los puertorriquenistas son[[Page H1249]]anticoloniales. Quieren para Puerto Rico la soberania que tienen y disfrutan los norteamericanos. eSi, asi es! Los puertorriquenistas quieren lo mismo que tienen los norteamericanos: vivir en una nacion libre y soberana donde ellos mismos dictan su futuro y no tienen amo.  Los puertorriquenistas ven el sol y ven energia que podemos cosechar. Ven la tierra y ven alimentos que nos daran de comer.  Los puertorriquenistas estan motivados por el amor a la patria y su herencia, y el conocimiento de que podemos ser grandes, que tenemos la inteligencia y la capacidad de innovar y crear.  Desde mi infancia en el destierro en Estados Unidos escuche la cancion ``Preciosa'' y vine a entender que el tirano, la negra maldad es el colonialismo norteamericano. Lo dijo Rafael Hernandez, la conciencia cantada de mi pueblo.  Los puertorriquenistas recuerdan con anoranza su patria ``En mi Viejo San Juan'' la cancion que dice ``. . . esa extrana nacion'', como decian los boricuas en Estado Unidos, ``esta no es mi tierra,'' cuando confrontaban el abuso, discriminacion y racismo. Puerto Rico lo es.  El puertorriqueno es su diaspora de Nueva York a Chicago, de San Juan a Ponce, todos somos puertorriquenos.

8957,topic-id,4282,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak once again on the so-called Affordable Care Act and the ongoing effort to repeal and replace. We all know the House of Representatives has produced a repeal and replace package, and both the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees have been marking it up. We don't know what it is right now. In other words, the endeavor to right the wrongs of ObamaCare is moving steadily forward on the other side of the Capitol, and soon it will be the Senate's turn to act. I commend my colleagues for introducing this legislation and moving it forward. This is an important step, and I don't think I am alone when I say that I am watching the progress in the House very carefully to see how things proceed and what the final House product will look like.  Of course, virtually all Republicans in Congress want to repeal and replace We are in unison there. While there are some differences of opinion on how best to do that, there is generally unanimity on that point. I am confident that whatever differences exist among House Members will be worked out through the House's legislative process.  In addition, whatever passes in the House will be subject to the input and review of the Senate and to the rules of the budget reconciliation process. I want to note that I have heard from a number of Senators who have items they would like to see included when the bill comes before the I actually have several ideas of my own. However, there are limits as to what we can do under the budget reconciliation rule. Many of the proposed policy changes I have heard, although they have merit, would be banned by the rules and subject to the 60-vote threshold. That said, I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the floor to ensure that the[[Page S1731]]Senate process on this bill is productive and that it yields a result we can support.  Long story short: This process is far from over. We have a lot more work to do. It is worth pointing out that the vast majority of the policies at play in this discussion and virtually all of the spending fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair. Make no mistake. The Finance Committee is already hard at work and has been for some time. In many respects, I suppose you could say we have been working on this effort since the day ObamaCare was signed into law. However, for obvious reasons, our work has intensified over the past several months.  In working through this process, I have been in constant contact with Chairmen Brady and Walden, who head up the relevant committees in the I have also been working closely with the Speaker's office, and I have been gathering input from Governors around the country. In addition, I have been working closely with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Enzi, who has the chief responsibility of navigating the budget process and shepherding a final repeal-and-replace bill through all the necessary rules and restrictions.  In all of those conversations, we have been talking about the process, and we have been talking about the timing. Most importantly, we have been talking about the substance of the healthcare reforms and how we can best serve the interests of the American people.  Throughout this effort, we have been reminded that Republicans currently control the White House and both Chambers in Congress due, in large part, to our stated commitment to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we intend to deliver on that promise.  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the policies we will need to tackle as we take up the House healthcare bill in the coming weeks.  Once again, the vast majority of the policies and virtually all of the spending involved in this effort fall under the Finance Committee's exclusive jurisdiction, and I intend to make sure all of my colleagues are well informed on the issues and that in the end whatever version of the bill we pass in the Senate reflects the collective will of a majority of  All told, there are five major policy areas that are addressed in the House bill that fall under the Finance Committee's purview.  First, there are the provisions to repeal the ObamaCare taxes. This is big. If one recalls, I came to the floor a few weeks ago and pointed out how misguided it would be, in my view, to start picking and sorting through the ObamaCare taxes to decide which to keep and which to leave in place. The House bill repeals them, along with the individual and employer mandates, both of which reside in the Tax I have been working with Chairman Brady on this issue. In the end, I believe the Senate version of the bill should do the same, and I am going to continue to push to ensure it does.  Second, there is the issue of premium tax credits. Chairman Brady and I have been working extensively on this issue as well. The House bill replaces the ObamaCare premium subsidies with a refundable tax credit for the purpose of State-approved health insurance, limited to those who do not qualify for other governmental healthcare programs and who have not been offered insurance benefits from their employers. Most major ObamaCare replacement proposals that we have seen contain some version of health insurance tax credits. The House approach represents a significant improvement over the ObamaCare premium subsidies. The Senate, when it takes up the bill, will have to consider how best to implement the tax credits. I will continue to work with my House and Senate colleagues to ensure that the tax credits are designed to help those lower and middle-income Americans who are the most in need.  Third, there are the issues surrounding Chairman Walden and his predecessor, Chairman Upton, and I have been working extensively on this matter. As we know, the vast majority of the newly insured people who the proponents of ObamaCare have cited as proof that the system is working have been covered by the expanded Medicaid  The problem, of course, is that the Affordable Care Act did not do anything to improve Medicaid, which was already absurdly expensive for States, and ultimately unsustainable, not to mention the fact that it provides substandard healthcare coverage.  The House bill draws down the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion and makes a number of significant changes to the underlying program. Most notably, it establishes per capita caps on Federal Medicaid spending, which are intended to give States more flexibility and predictability while also controlling Federal outlays related to the program.  We have received substantial input on this matter from Governors around the country, and virtually all of them agree changes need to be made. Given these concerns and the sheer vastness of the Medicaid Program under ObamaCare, the Senate will have to tackle this issue when it takes up the budget reconciliation legislation in the next few weeks.  I am confident that in working with my colleagues in the House and Senate and with the Governors, we can find the right solution.  Fourth, there is the issue of savings accounts for healthcare costs. I have long been an advocate for the expanded use of HSAs and Needless to say, I was particularly opposed to the ObamaCare provisions that limited the use of these savings accounts and essentially marginalized their usefulness for consumers and patients.  The House bill removes a number of restrictions on these accounts that have been imposed by ObamaCare, and it goes further to remove longstanding restrictions on HSAs in order to expand their use and give patients and consumers more options to pay for health expenses.  I am very supportive of this approach. In fact, the language from the House bill mirrors the legislation I introduced this year--the Health Savings Act of 2017.  Fifth, there are some important transition issues that need to be addressed.  To get at these issues, the House bill creates a Patient and State Stability Program, under the Social Security Act, that would distribute $100 billion to States over 10 years to enhance flexibility for States in how they manage healthcare for their high-risk and low-income populations.  For example, the funds could be used to, among other things, help individuals with cost-sharing. This program was proposed with the idea of giving States an expanded role in the healthcare system, a goal that is shared by most Republicans in Congress and something that almost all of the Governors have told us they want to see.  There are other issues from the House bill in the broader healthcare debate that will demand some attention when we consider the bill in the However, almost all of them fall under these general categories. Once again, the vast majority of them fall under the sole jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, the primary committee.  There are other critical issues out there which do not involve the Tax Code, the Social Security Act, or Federal health programs. Yet they are extremely important.  The biggest mistake made by those who drafted ObamaCare and forced it through Congress was their failure to address healthcare costs in any meaningful way. After all, cost is the largest barrier preventing people from obtaining health insurance coverage, and the increasing healthcare costs are among the most prominent factors leading to wage stagnation for U.workers. Yet ObamaCare did little to address this problem, and in fact it has made things worse.  If we are going to fully keep our promises to the American people with regard to ObamaCare, we are going to have to eventually address these issues. After all, most people's negative interaction with the Affordable Care Act has come in the form of increased healthcare costs. If we are going to truly right all of ObamaCare's wrongs, we need to tackle the costs head on.  This will mean, among other things, fixing the draconian regulatory regime in our health insurance markets and giving individuals the ability to select only the coverage they want and need.[[Page S1732]]Many of these types of issues fall far outside of the Finance Committee's jurisdiction and are under the watchful eye of the distinguished chairman of the Senate HELP  The House bill also includes some provisions that are intended to address these concerns. I assume our distinguished colleague running the HELP Committee is working tirelessly to address the issues, and others, both through the reconciliation exercise or some alternative means.  Ultimately, if our goal is to place the healthcare system in a better position than it has been under ObamaCare, costs will have to factor heavily into the equation. I am looking forward to receiving guidance and leadership on the HELP Committee on these important market reform issues.  Overall, I believe we can and will be successful in this endeavor to fix our broken healthcare system. The American people are counting on us to do so. At the end of the day, success in that endeavor is, in my view, going to require a robust Senate process that allows this Chamber to work its will.  We have two Chambers in Congress for a reason. The House reconciliation bill needs 218 votes to pass. The Senate will also have to act when we receive the bill, and we will need to produce a package that can get at least 51 votes in this Chamber and hopefully more. That may mean some differences between the Senate and the House versions of the bill, but that is not problematic in my view. It is not particularly novel or unusual for different views and ideas to be resolved through the legislative process rather than simply dissipating when a bill is introduced. It seems to me that is not novel, and I am not the only one who has this view.  Earlier this week, Secretary Price sent a letter to the chairmen of the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce The letter commended the chairmen for their work and praised the legislation they unveiled to repeal and replace  The Secretary also noted that this was not the end of the process but that the introduction of the House bill was a ``necessary and important first step'' and that the administration anticipated that the Congress would be ``making necessary technical and appropriate changes'' to get a final bill to the President that he can sign, which reminds us of the other important advocate in this endeavor. President Trump ultimately needs to support the bill that is passed by each Chamber of Congress, and his support for our efforts is paramount.  While, at this point, it may not be entirely clear what the final bill will look like, we do know two things for certain. First, we know that ObamaCare is not working. As the majority leader said yesterday, ObamaCare is a direct attack on the American middle class. Thanks to skyrocketing premiums, shrinking options in the health insurance market, burdensome mandates, and harmful taxes, millions of Americans are dealing with the failures of ObamaCare on a daily basis. We need to act now to fix these problems.  Second, we know that by introducing its bill and moving it through the legislative process, the House has taken significant steps in advancing this effort, and the leaders in the House should be commended for doing so.  Long story short, I have nothing but praise for the leaders in the House this week for the work they have done on these issues. Remember, this is just the beginning. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Chambers to get this over the finish line so the Republicans can collectively make good on our promises with regard to                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  Later this month, Judge Gorsuch will come before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing. I wish to speak today on what we can and should expect to happen during that hearing.  First, some background. This will be the 14th Supreme Court confirmation hearing I have participated in. I have seen some truly outstanding hearings in which both the nominee and the Senators acquitted themselves well. I have also seen some hearings that have gone far off the rails, in which some Senators hurled unfounded allegations or sought to twist the nominee's clearly distinguished record. I am hopeful Judge Gorsuch's hearing will be the former type.  We have before us a supremely qualified, highly respected, and extremely thoughtful nominee. Judge Gorsuch has had a stellar legal career, and by all accounts, he is a man of tremendous integrity, kindness, and respect. He is the sort of person all Americans should want on the Supreme He does not approach cases with preconceived outcomes in mind. He seeks to apply the law fairly and impartially in line with what the democratically elected representatives who enacted the law had in mind. He will be a truly outstanding  Judge Gorsuch's hearing will focus on his background, his temperament, and his approach to judging. So let's talk a little about what we know about Judge We know he has an outstanding academic record. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School and obtained a doctor of philosophy in law from Oxford We know he had a highly successful legal career before becoming a judge.  He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices before entering private practice here in He made partner in only 2 years, which shows how highly his colleagues at the firm thought of him and his work.  Following a decade in private practice, Judge Gorsuch was appointed Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice, where he oversaw the Department's antitrust, civil, and environmental tax units.  In 2006, President Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth circuit--the circuit in which I reside. The Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch unanimously by voice vote a short 2 months later. At Judge Gorsuch's investiture, then-Senator Ken Salazar, who later served as President Obama's Interior Secretary, praised Judge Gorsuch's ``sense of fairness and impartiality.'' That fairness and impartiality, which was evident to my colleagues even then, was a large reason why Judge Gorsuch won confirmation without a single dissenting vote.  Judge Gorsuch's hearing will also affect us on his temperament and approach to judging. No one can seriously doubt that Judge Gorsuch has an excellent judicial temperament. A recent article in Slate--no rightwing paper, by any means--described the judge as ``thoughtful and fair-minded, principled, and consistent.''  The Denver Post, which twice endorsed President Obama for President and endorsed Hillary Clinton in this past election, also recently endorsed Judge Gorsuch's nomination, saying: ``From his bench in the U.Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, he has applied the law fairly and consistently.''  Clearly, Judge Gorsuch has the right temperament to serve on the Supreme  His approach to judging is also spot-on. Judge Gorsuch's opinions show that he is not only an excellent writer but also that he understands the proper role of a judge in our constitutional system. He consistently explains his reasoning by reference to fundamental constitutional principles. He does not seek to push the law toward the outcomes he favors but instead tries to apply it in harmony with the understanding of those who wrote and passed it. In so doing, he shows a healthy respect for the legislative process and for the democratically elected branches of government.  As Judge Gorsuch said in a speech shortly after Justice Scalia's passing, ``Judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is, using traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views.''  Judge Gorsuch's opinions demonstrate that he understands fundamentally the importance of this principle and that he seeks faithfully to apply it in his own judging.  Against this impressive list of qualifications, Democrats and their liberal allies strain mightily to find plausible grounds to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They misread his opinions, misstate his reasoning, and in[[Page S1733]]general paint a picture of a man who simply does not exist. We can expect more of this at his confirmation hearing. In particular, we can expect to be raised again and again the risible and flatly false claim that Judge Gorsuch is outside the ``judicial mainstream.'' These arguments against Judge Gorsuch are not persuasive--not even close. We see hints of them in the various letters liberal interest groups have sent Congress claiming that Judge Gorsuch is a threat to the Republic--a danger to our very way of life. The over-the-top language these groups use only serves to highlight the weakness of their case against Judge  One such letter called the judge ``an ultra-conservative jurist who will undermine our basic freedoms and threaten the independence of the Federal judiciary.'' The letter goes on to say that there is ``zero evidence that Judge Gorsuch will be an independent check on this runaway and dangerous administration.''  As an initial matter, I would ask: If Judge Gorsuch is such an existential threat to the Republic, where were all these groups 10 years ago when he won confirmation to the Tenth Circuit unanimously? Did Judge Gorsuch spend the first 40 years of his life hiding what a monster he is, revealing his true self only once safely ensconced on the Federal bench?  The outlandishness of these claims against Judge Gorsuch is made clear by the support he has received from prominent liberals, including President Obama's own Solicitor General, Neal In an op-ed published in the New York Times, Neal Katyal praised Judge Gorsuch's fairness and decency and said that he had no doubt that, if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would ``help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' Katyal further wrote that Judge Gorsuch's record as a judge reveals a commitment to judicial independence, a record that should ``give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.''  It bears mention here that Mr.Katyal is no shrinking violet when it comes to standing up to the executive branch. He rose to prominence in the legal community through his work representing Guantanamo detainees. So when he says Judge Gorsuch will not shy away from holding Federal officials to account, frankly, his words carry weight.  Then there is the phrase we are likely to hear invoked again and again at Judge Gorsuch's hearing and beyond: ``judicial mainstream.'' Liberals will tie themselves in knots claiming that Judge Gorsuch is some sort of fringe jurist, that his views place him on the far flank of the Federal judiciary. Any honest observer will tell you that these claims are complete bunk. President Obama's Solicitor General and liberal publications like Slate would not offer praise for Judge Gorsuch if he were some kind of a nut.  In reality, the claims that Judge Gorsuch is outside the mainstream boil down to three things: a willful misreading of his decisions, a disingenuous attempt to redefine what it means to be mainstream, and an inability to count. On the misreading point, opponents of Judge Gorsuch claim that his decisions say things that they very clearly do not say or stand for propositions that even a generous reading cannot substantiate. They say he favors large corporations over employees, when really he just believes Federal employment laws mean what they say. They say he opposes contraception and family planning, when really he just believes religious liberty statutes should be enforced.  Judge Gorsuch's opponents also cite as examples of his purported extremism decisions that liberal Democratic appointees joined or that a majority of his colleagues agreed with. They will take a case in which more than half--or sometimes all--of the judges who heard the case agree with Judge Gorsuch and say the decision was outside the mainstream. I don't know about my colleagues, but I always thought that being in the mainstream had something to do with being somewhere in the vicinity of your peers or colleagues on a given issue. But, apparently, that is not what the left means.  Rather, in their failing campaign against Judge Gorsuch, liberals have redefined ``mainstream'' to really mean nothing at all. It has become a code word for liberal, for the sorts of results that liberals would like to see. But being in the mainstream and being liberal are not the same thing, despite Democrats' fondest desires. There is such a thing as diversity of thought, which the left used to venerate, at least until the confirmation wars and the rise of the conformity cult on college campuses.  So to my colleagues--and to the American people--I say: Do not be deceived when liberals say that Judge Gorsuch is outside the mainstream. He understands that the proper role of a judge in our constitutional system is to interpret the laws in accordance with the understanding of those who wrote and ratified those laws. This approach to judging leaves lawmaking power to the people's elected representatives and confines the judge's role to implementing the policy choices selected by those representatives. It is an approach consistent with our Constitution, our core values, and democracy itself.  It may be at times that this approach yields results that liberals don't like, but that doesn't place it outside the mainstream. It cannot be the case that the test of whether a judge is in the mainstream is whether that judge reaches consistently liberal results. When the people's elected representatives enact into law a conservative policy, a judge faithfully applying that law may well reach a conservative result. The opposite is true when the people's elected representatives enact into law a liberal policy.  All of this is to say that we cannot judge a nominee solely on the basis of whether we like the results he or she reaches. As Justice Scalia famously said:       If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have      to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going      to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the      time, you are probably doing something wrong.  That is an interesting statement by one of the great judges, whom Judge Gorsuch will replace.  Liberals want judges who will always reach liberal results, but that is not the role of the judge. It is the role of a legislator, and a judge is certainly not a legislator.  So when you hear liberals say Judge Gorsuch is outside the mainstream, recognize that they are talking about results--specifically, liberal results--and recognize that that is not the proper inquiry for a Supreme Court confirmation hearing.  A Supreme Court confirmation hearing should be about the nominee, the nominee's experience, and whether the nominee understands his or her properly constrained role as a judge under our On all of these metrics, Judge Gorsuch is off-the-charts qualified.  When the good judge comes before the Judiciary Committee, listen to the answers he gives. Ask yourself whether what he says is consistent with the separation of powers and the system the Framers designed. Compare his measured demeanor and thoughtful responses to the histrionics you see from his opponents on the left.  I have full confidence that when the hearing is over and the last question has been asked, Judge Gorsuch will have shown the Senate that he is unquestionably qualified and fully prepared to serve our Nation on the Supreme  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

I know a little something about national security, and the executive order signed by President Trump on Saturday is not only about national security, it is profoundly dangerous to the security of this country because it gives our enemies a logic to say the United States is bigoted; it is anti-Muslim; and it does not stand for its principles.  What is this executive order?  It is a travesty. It is dangerous security theater. It is a knife in the heart of the values that founded this country. What it is most assuredly not is a mechanism to keep us safer.  It opens with a preamble on 9/11--a devastating day for all of us. Yet, not one of the countries that produced the 9/11 hijackers is on the list of countries affected by this order.  How do you explain that?  All over the world right now radical Muslims are saying: We told you so.  And we are hearing this from our generals. We are hearing this from our national security experts; not one of whom has stood up and said that this is a good idea which will keep us safer.  It comes at a huge cost to our country. The costs to our values that we are a decent country are incalculable and we will be bearing them for a long time.  We are the Congress of the United We are the House of We are the people's Article I of the Constitution--now is the time to stand up against this madness. I plead with my Republican colleagues: Now is the time to stand up for national security, for safety, and for the values enshrined by the Constitution to which we all pledged an oath.  I understand I am a Democrat, so maybe I don't have that much credibility with my Republican colleagues. Let me quote to you what Eliot Cohen, noted conservative, national security strategist, former State Department official said: ``Either you stand up for your principles and for what you know is decent behavior, or you go down, if not now, then years from now, as a coward or opportunist. Your reputation will never recover, nor should it.''  History is staring us in the face right now. It doesn't happen very often, but it is staring us in the face right now. And when history stares you in the face, that is not a gaze that wavers. It stays for generations. And how you respond to that gaze and how you behave will be the stuff of the stories of your children and your grandchildren.  So now is the time for the Congress of the United States to stand up to the bigotry, to the national security theater, to the destruction of our values, with legislation that reverses this travesty of a decision that we saw this weekend.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgH706.txt,1913,MAKE IT IN AMERICA,2017.0,30.0,March
8670,topic-id,1975,"Mr.President, I was not preparing to come down to speak today, but I just want to make a few comments because I have been listening to what is going on in one of the other rooms out there. Everyone is zeroing in and targeting a guy named Scott Pruitt, who they don't think should be confirmed to be the Administrator of the I know Scott Pruitt very well, and he happens to be the attorney general for my State of In fact, I recruited him to run for the State legislature many years ago, and he is someone I know very well. He resides in my city of Tulsa, OK, and he is eminently qualified for this position. I would just like to make a couple of comments in response.  I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee for some number of years, and during that timeframe, we started considering his nomination. I heard all kinds of criticism. I say to the Chair that they talk about the fact that he has sued the EPA and how can a person who has sued the EPA be qualified to serve as the Administrator of the EPA? Well, I think that is a pretty good qualification, considering what the EPA was doing during the Obama administration. Look at some of the lawsuits he has been involved with.  ``WOTUS'' is the acronym for ``waters of the United States.'' Of the many regulations they have come up with, this is one of the most onerous. In fact, I would say that probably in all States--Louisiana, Oklahoma, and the rest of them--they gave the same response as the farm girl gave when we asked the question--I asked the question: What is the worst thing that could happen or has happened to the farmers and ranchers of America--not just in Oklahoma but throughout America? And they said it is not anything that is in the Agriculture bill, it is the overregulation of the When we ask the question ``Which of all the overregulations of the EPA is the worst one?'' according to farmers, it is the WOTUS regulation, the waters of the United  For as long as I can remember, liberals have tried to get the jurisdiction of water away from the States and give it to the Federal I mean, that is the general philosophy of someone who is liberal--they want the power of the United States to be concentrated in So this is a part of that effort. As a matter of fact, it was 6 years ago that there was a House Member and a Senate Member who introduced a bill to take the word ``navigable'' out of our laws. State governments have control of all water rights except for navigable waters. If they had taken the word ``navigable'' out, the Federal Government could have taken over the entire jurisdiction. The two who were doing that were Senator Feingold from Wisconsin and Congressman Oberstar from Not only did we defeat both of those pieces of legislation 6 years ago, but they were both defeated at the polls afterward. So if this is an issue, it is an issue that has been around for a long time.  So yes, in fact, Scott Pruitt, as the attorney general of Oklahoma, from Tulsa, joined 15 other States, including the State of Louisiana, in suing to stop the rule that the Obama administration had put through in WOTUS, the water resources. To show how he was on sound ground, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has since that time said that, yes, he was right. They put a stay on it.  The next bill, the next of the regulations--I just did a TV thing where they were asking about the most onerous of regulations. It is kind of hard to answer that question because they are all so bad--they all inflict such a hardship on the business community throughout America--but the Clean Power Plan, let's go back and look at the history of that.  The Clean Power Plan all started back in about 2002, when at that time they wanted to do it when they first started talking about global warming so they were going to somehow do away with the emissions of So they tried to do it with legislation in 2002, and then again in 2004, again in 2005, and about every other year since then, and it has always been rejected by the It has been rejected by the Senate by an increased margin each time. Yet they keep saying, no, we are going to have some type of cap-and-trade legislation. We calculated what that would cost. It is between $300 billion and $400 billion a year, and frankly it wouldn't accomplish anything.  The first administrator for the EPA under Obama was Lisa I enjoyed her. I asked her the question: If[[Page S426]]we were to do away with CO2 altogether in the United States, would this have the effect of reducing it worldwide, and she said: No, because this isn't where the problem is. The problem is in China, India, and in So the more we chase our ability to generate electricity to those areas, the more--and they don't have any restrictions on CO2 emissions--then that is going to increase, not decrease.  They were not able to pass it legislatively. So along comes President Obama, and he said: Well, we can't do it through legislation, we will do it through regulation, so they had the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan was essentially the same thing as the legislation we defeated.  So Scott Pruitt, the attorney general from Oklahoma, came along, and he filed a lawsuit against the EPA, and this worked out really pretty well. It had a lot of support behind it. It wasn't the Sixth Circuit, it was the U.Supreme Court that stayed this. So what I am saying is, sure, he has had the occasion, along with some 26 other States, in the case of the Clean Power Plan, of filing a lawsuit against the EPA, but he has been successful in doing that.  Let me clarify another thing that has been misrepresented on this floor several times. They referred to a characterization I gave about 4 or 5 years ago called the hoax. The hoax is not climate change. We all know the climate is constantly changing. All the evidence is there. There is scriptural evidence, historical evidence. It has always been there. The climate has always changed. The hoax is that the world is coming to an end because of manmade gases. That is the clarification that needs to be made if we are going to be completely honest.  By the way, when they criticized Scott Pruitt for suing the EPA, I am reminding them that he also has sued several oil companies, including ConocoPhillips--he had a lawsuit against them for alleged double dipping--as well as BP and Chevron, so it is not just as if he is somehow owned by the oil companies. I always have to say, when people say the oil companies contribute to campaigns, not anything like the far left environmentalists do.  I remember Tom Tom Steyer said before the 2014 elections: I am going to put $100 million of my money to elect people who go along with all of these far-left programs. Of course, it didn't work in 2014. He actually at that time spent $75 million. This is one individual we are talking about. So those guys over there, they are the ones who are putting money into campaigns, and I understand that.  The last thing I want to correct--and I wish more people would talk about this. Frankly, I wish President Trump would say more about this because they always talk about how 97 percent of the scientists go along with the global warming thing. That isn't true at all. In fact, if you go to my Web site, you will find a piece that was in the Wall Street Journal that makes it very clear that isn't true and documents that case. The scientists who have been saying this are one group that is called the IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate That is the United Nations, in case there is someone who doesn't understand that. They are the ones who have provided all the credibility in terms of the science that backs up all the statements that are made about global warming.  I had the occasion--some people are not aware that once every December, now for 21 years, the United Nations has had the biggest party of the year. It is always in some exotic place. I remember in 2009 it was in We had all the people--several friends I love dearly here in the U.Senate and in the House went over there to tell 192 countries that we were going to pass legislation that would have cap and trade. I went over as the truth squad of one person to tell them what had been represented to them was, in fact, not going to happen.  Well, right before going, Lisa Jackson was the first nominee, or the first confirmed Administrator of the I asked her the question on the record, live on TV, in the committee room, on the committee that I chaired, I said: I am going to be going over to Copenhagen to tell them the truth over there, and, in the meantime, you are going to take over jurisdiction so you can try to do this with a regulation. To do that, you have to have an endangerment finding. To have an endangerment finding, you have to have science behind that. She was smiling. She is a very honest person.  I asked her: What science are you going to use for your endangerment finding that gives you the opportunity to do what you couldn't do with legislation that you think you can do with regulation? She said: The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  As luck would have it, it was a matter of days after that that climategate came about. How many people remember climategate? They never talk about it. Let me just tell you how it was characterized. Climategate was those individuals who were at the top of the IPCC had gotten together and tried to alter the science to support their point of view, and they got caught doing it. The world responded to it. Newsweek: ``Once celebrated climate researchers feeling like the used car salesman.''  ``Some of the IPCC's most quoted data and recommendations were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures. . . . ''  The U.scientist Philip Lloyd said: ``The result is not scientific.''  They were all talking about climategate. They were talking about how the IPCC rigged the science.  A guy that was an IPCC physicist said that ``Climategate was a fraud on a scale I've never seen.''  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said that ``the stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.''  Christopher Booker with the UK's Telegraph--that is one of the largest in London--said it is the ``worst scientific scandal of our generation.''  They are talking about the science that is behind the accusations they have made.  So if anyone hears these claims repeated, or even if it has been repeated, saying that at least 97 percent of the scientists agree, they are not right.  My time has expired, but I just wanted to clarify that so people know--because one thing I know that is going to happen is, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of the State of Oklahoma, will be confirmed by a good margin--I think by a party margin--to be the Administrator of the It will be a great change.

8860,topic-id,1190,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about my friend, Tom In a way, I am glad the minority leader brought up Representative Price and brought up specific allegations that have been made against him so I can hopefully put some light on the misperception that those allegations made and, in fact, shine some positive light on a great nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human  I have known Tom Price for 30 years of my life. He and his wife Betty are dear friends. Their son Robert is the age of one of my sons. He is a fine young man. Tom is a leader in our community, a leader in the Roswell United Methodist Church, the first-ever elected Republican majority leader of the State of Georgia Senate, the chairman of the Budget Committee of the U.House of Representatives, former president of the study committee in the House of Representatives, and an all-around terrific individual who has a litany and liturgy of recommended approvals and improvements that have made the United States of America legislatively and legally much better.  Tom is a family man. I mentioned Betty and his son He is an accomplished professional. He is an orthopedic surgeon. He and his wife Betty met during their residencies at Grady Memorial She is an anesthesiologist. Tom is an accomplished orthopedic surgeon.  Tom is one of those orthopedists who came together with a number of other orthopedists to form what is known as Resurgens Orthopaedics, the largest orthopedic practice in the Southeastern United States--one of the finest anywhere in the country.  Tom has worked tirelessly in the Republican Party, tirelessly on the Democratic-Republican bipartisan agreements that have been made, and tirelessly on behalf of his community.  He is a fine individual and is uniquely qualified to be the Secretary of Health and Human This is an agency that will spend $1 trillion of the taxpayers' money on an annual basis. You want a man who has been chairman of the Budget You want a man who understands finances. You want a former legislator who knows how to get the job done. Tom Price is that man.  In fact, I am particularly well qualified to introduce Tom to this body and recommend him as Secretary of HHS because he replaced me when I left the House when I was elected to the He has been reelected six times. He served 6\1/2\ terms in the House of Representatives, and he has an extensive legal background, an extensive legislative background, and an accomplished background of conservative leadership for the United States of Most importantly, he has done so on many issues dealing with medicine, and why not? He is an expert in medicine.  I know a little bit about real estate. I authored legislation on real estate. That is what you do when you are in a profession and know a little about something Congress is looking at. But the allegations made by Senator Schumer--and being echoed in some of the media and papers around town--are just another example of taking disparate impact.  I want to talk to you a little about what Senator Schumer was talking about. He was talking about the purchase of Zimmer Biomet stock, 26 shares, worth $2,674. That is what he was talking about. The two disparate facts that he put together to make a wrong were this: The purchase was made without Tom's knowledge because his account is managed by Smith Barney and Morgan They manage his account. They make the decisions about what to buy. Tom doesn't make them. Tom found out about it and documented it on April 4, even though the purchase was made in He didn't even know the purchase had been made on his behalf until it was disclosed, which he did as he is required to do by the STOCK  Every single fact brought up by the distinguished minority leader is a fact that is a required disclosure of the rules of the U.Senate to the Ethics Committee under the STOCK So don't make this look like some sinister thing, and let's take it at face value. If you take it at face value, it was a purchase Tom didn't make; it was made on his behalf. It was a purchase we documented that he didn't know about until the 4th of April; the purchase was made in The purchase did not work to his benefit because the decision was not made by him.  He is like every other Member of the Senate and House who makes required disclosures of their activity because of the STOCK Tom obeyed the law. Tom did what was right. What was done is right and is being made to look wrong only because of appearance but not because of fact. That is the wrong way to take on the consideration of any nominee of a President of the United States to be a Secretary of any part of the Cabinet.[[Page S326]]  I reiterate: Who else would be better to oversee $1 trillion in spending than Tom Price, chairman of the Budget Committee, former member of Ways and Means, an accomplished legislator who put together the largest orthopedic practice in Atlanta, GA, and the State of Georgia? He is well qualified and eminently qualified. This body should overwhelmingly confirm his nomination to be U.Secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States of  I am proud as his friend, I am proud as a former associate and legislator, I am proud as the person he succeeded in the U.House of Representatives, and I am proud as an American citizen to know that our President has picked someone who is eminently qualified, who has an impeccable record of success in his legislative jobs, who is a fine family man, a member of his church, a disciplined member of his political party and, most importantly, a man who loves his country and is volunteering to sacrifice his time and his knowledge to make America's Department of Health and Human Services better.

That was an observation that Richard Nixon made in the context of the Watergate scandal which began as a nickel-and-dime break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the summer of 1972, and, obviously, concluded with impeachment proceedings and the ultimate resignation of a President in disgrace.  Nixon made the observation that the American people deserve to know whether or not the President is a crook, and many people across the country are raising a similar question because 17 different intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians, at the explicit direction of Vladimir Putin, interfered in our election for the purpose of helping Donald Yet, it is hard to get an independent investigation going in this place because my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to put party ahead of the country.  But that is just the beginning. We know that, as early as December of 2015, at least four different cronies of Donald Trump were in regular communication with Russian intelligence agents at the same time these individuals were hacking into the DNC, the DCCC, and the Clinton campaign, interfering with our democracy. These individuals were Michael Flynn, who came to become Trump's first national security adviser; Carter Page, who was his former foreign policy adviser; Paul Manafort, who was the chairman of the Trump campaign; and Roger Stone, a longtime affiliate.  If they were having these conversations at this time, we know they probably weren't talking about Russian vodka. What were they talking about? The American people deserve to know.  We also are aware that Michael Flynn had an illegal conversation, in December of 2016, with the Russian Ambassador where he discussed sanctions that were imposed on Russia because of their hacking. He then apparently lied about this conversation to the Vice President who then went out and misrepresented facts to the American people, and then Michael Flynn resigned in disgrace. But we still can't get an independent, nonpartisan investigation in this place.  But that is not all. We know that Donald Trump has not been bashful when going after our allies like Mexico or Australia or NATO or the European Union or, this past weekend, He is not bashful about being critical, but he can't say a negative word about Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. It appears that this President is more determined to make the Kremlin great again.  But that is not all. He refuses to release his taxes despite promising the American people that he was going to do so prior to November of last year. What exactly is he hiding in these tax documents? Yet, we still can't get an independent investigation.  We also know that the White House Chief of Staff engaged in potentially unlawful conversations with the FBI, perhaps trying to get them to obstruct justice in the public sphere in the midst of an ongoing investigation.

It was also a victory for the millions of Americans who attended townhall meetings, who wrote letters and emails, who spoke up. Their voices were heard. But we have more work to do, Democrats and Republicans, in order to make sure that all Americans have access to affordable health care.  We need now to turn our attention to doing what we can to improve the Affordable Care Act in a bipartisan way. We have ways to make this work better. It is not a perfect bill; of course it isn't. Nothing we do here is perfect. It needs improvement, significant improvement. We have ways to make that happen that I think Democrats and Republicans can come together on.  For example, improving access to prescription drugs by reducing the cost of those drugs in the marketplace. There are so many things we can do, Republicans and We have got to roll up our sleeves and get to work.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2470-2.txt,2134,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS,2017.0,28.0,March

Today is the day when this House will vote on whether or not access to health care is a fundamental right in this country or should be limited to those of means who can afford it, whether access to lifesaving preventative care is something that Americans ought to be able to depend upon.  Now, we haven't seen the final language of the bill--it is still being worked on--although we are voting on it today, but here is what we know:  It will result in higher costs.  It will force families to pay higher premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs.  It will provide less coverage; and, in fact, just in the last couple of days,[[Page H2374]]even less coverage, by eliminating essential health benefits like preventative care, like hospitalization, like prescription drugs.

He has earned--and rightlydeserves--near-universal respect. While I opposed the hurried waiving of a carefully considered statutory cooling off period formembers of the military before they can become eligible for this civilian position, I made clear then, and restate now, that myopposition to this waiver was never about General Mattis himself.  I was grateful when General Mattis said in his confirmationhearing that, even from his first days as a marine, he has observed that, in the photographs on the walls of Department ofDefense establishments, the civilians in suits were above those of the men and women in uniforms. I was pleased that he vowed touphold that meaningful tradition. I am confident that, as the President's top adviser on matters of defense, as Secretary,General Mattis will carefully provide considered defense advice, maximizing the wisdom of not only the Active, Reserve, andNational Guard, but the whole of the Department of Defense, including Department civilians.  Donald Trump will sorely needthat experience and advice. Last weekend, President Trump again denigrated our NATO allies, a partnership that President Kennedyvery much had in mind when he vowed at his own inauguration to ``pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support anyfriend, and oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.'' General Mattis clearly understands the value of ourNATO alliance. His condemnation of Russia's efforts to ``break'' NATO stands in stark contrast to the position of the man whohas nominated him and, to me, demonstrates the sound, experienced reasoning that will provide a necessary balance to  I do harbor reservations about General Mattis's past statements as a private citizen related to equality within theranks of our servicemembers. I would have much preferred to hear General Mattis renounced those past statements, but I doappreciate that, in his confirmation hearings, he said that there is nothing innate about gender or orientation that makessomeone a better soldier than another. I believe the results of the progress made under President Obama will show clearly thatthe Nation succeeds when it has the best individuals serving to their fullest potential in the position that best matches his orher abilities.  The Secretary of Defense is, of course, a critically important position. There are countless difficult choicesGeneral Mattis will have to make in steering the Department in a direction that more effectively utilizes its budget to respondto today's rapidly evolving challenges. And whether it is the persistent, shockingly high rates of sexual assault within theArmed Forces and of suicide among young veterans, or the need for far more rigorous oversight of Defense resources to reducewaste, fraud, and abuse, the next Secretary will need to demonstrate that the Department is capable of effectively addressingits own internal problems, in addition to defending the  In these unsettling times, General Mattis will provide avoice of experience and reason to what, by all accounts, looks to be an undisciplined, impulsive, and inexperienced Commander inOn the Appropriations Committee and in other ways, I look[[Page S352]]forward to working closely with General Mattis in thisnew role.  Mr.President, the Senate today considers the nomination of JohnKelly to be the Secretary of Homeland A retired marine, General Kelly is no stranger to security efforts. Over morethan four decades of service in the Marines, General Kelly distinguished himself through multiple commands and tours of duty. Heis well respected by elected officials, military officers, the Marines under his command, and the law enforcement andintelligence communities. I have no reason to doubt that he is a man of integrity.  But General Kelly is nominated to a fardifferent post than those he occupied during his distinguished military career. The Department of Homeland Security--a civilianagency within our government--is charged with a far-reaching mission. From protecting national security to implementingimmigration policies, from our emergency response to domestic crises, to assisting in the unending fight against drugs in ourcommunities that today features opioids and heroin as its most prevalent threat, the Department of Homeland Security faceschallenges as unique as they are numerous. While I am confident that General Kelly is well equipped to exert leadership on manyof these challenges, his nomination has also raised concerns.  As we look ahead to the policies and practices this newadministration will seek to implement, we cannot forget the work left unfinished in the Obama administration due to theobstruction of congressional In 2013, after a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, truly comprehensive immigrationreform legislation was sent to the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders there refused to even bring it to a vote.That legislation addressed a litany of issues facing our broken immigration system, from securing our borders to reforming visaprograms, from bringing the undocumented out of the shadows to reuniting families.  After House Republicans failed to bringthat bill to a vote, President Obama took executive action to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, andestablish the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, DAPA, programs. These actions would haveoffered a reprieve for young people and parents so that they could remain in the country, with their families, and without fearof deportation. It is fundamentally unfair for the new administration to revoke a policy designed to bring vulnerable immigrantsout of the shadows and then to use information gained from that policy to punish them.  I was disheartened when a Federalcourt issued an injunction preventing implementation of these policies. I was more disheartened when the Supreme Court wasunable to resolve this court challenge, again, due to obstruction from congressional Republicans in the consideration ofPresident Obama's nominee to the Supreme Now, this new administration is poised to withdraw these executiveorders.  General Kelly is no stranger to the problems we face along the southern border. As the commander of U.SouthernCommand, he is familiar not only with immigration challenges, but with drug trafficking. While I am grateful that he has notsubscribed to the singular approach that President Trump has thus far proposed with respect to constructing a wall along oursouthern border, I am deeply concerned that he has admonished so-called sanctuary cities and has testified that accelerating thedeportation of undocumented immigrants will provide the solution to our broken immigration system. These views are not supportedby the facts, and they are contrary to the work undertaken by the Senate just 4 years ago to comprehensively address theseproblems. I am also concerned about his tenure as the military officer in charge of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,given reports that he opposed its closure and limited press access to the facility.  Vermonters know that the explosion ofheroin and opioid abuse across the country can, in many ways, be attributed to the cross-border trafficking of illegal drugs.General Kelly has been a strong defender of a U.counternarcotics strategy which, in my view and the view of many others, hasbeen a costly failure. Since President Reagan's first Andean Counter Drug Program, the interrelated problems of drugs,corruption, and violence that have plagued countries in South and Central America, and spilled over into our own country, havegotten progressively worse.  I do not doubt that General Kelly will be confirmed to this post. Knowing that, I do want to workwith him to build on successful policies such as preclearance operations, TSA Precheck, and the visa waiver program. I lookforward to partnering with him to ensure the continuation of efforts to keep our northern border secure, while remaining open tothe trade and commerce we conduct with Canada, our largest trading partner. I look forward to working with General Kelly toensure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is fully supported and able to respond to domestic disasters. And I lookforward to working with General Kelly to address vulnerabilities in our cyber infrastructure.  There are many challengesahead. The Department of Homeland Security was hastily created in the wake of the September 11 attacks and, in my view, hasbecome an unwieldly bureaucracy that suffers from inadequate transparency and accountability. This has resulted in adverse,sometimes severe consequences for many vulnerable people and their families who deserved better from this country. TheDepartment needs significant reform in order to effectively confront these challenges, and I urge General Kelly to seek theinput of a wide range of experts, as well as Congress, in identifying and implementing long overdue reforms. And above all, Ihope General Kelly, as the Secretary of Homeland Security, will provide a thoughtful and reasoned balance to the extremeproposals thus far put forward by President  Mr.Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of John Kelly to be Secretary of Homeland This is atremendously important position, especially in these dangerous and uncertain times, and it requires a highly qualified nomineewho will be able to handle one of the most complex positions here in Washington, After his impressive career and nominationhearing, few would question that he has the knowledge and the skill to lead the agency.  He has years of experience workingwith our neighbors in Latin America as former commander of U.Southern Command, where he saw firsthand the drivers of theunaccompanied minors crisis. In his testimony, he outlined what he saw as the root causes of migration, including people fleeingviolence and seeking asylum within the United  Yet the position requires more than experience, it requires a trueunderstanding of the issues and how they affect the men and women we are all sworn to serve. It is in this aspect that I havelingering concerns.  Anyone running DHS must be able to prioritize their resources in the apprehension, detention, and removalof undocumented immigrants. On November 20, 2014, the Department of Homeland Security outlined how scarce Federal resourceswould be allocated in enforcing our Nation's immigration laws. The memo focused resources on threats to national security,threats to national safety, and threats to border security, while deemphasizing law-abiding immigrants who have integratedthemselves into society. I have been generally supportive of this prioritization, as I believe that Federal resources shouldbe spent on enforcement actions against serious criminals.  On day one as Secretary of Homeland Security, General Kelly willhave to address this. I hope he will recognize the wisdom of keeping families together, protecting children and the DeferredAction for Childhood Arrivals DACA Program and focus on deporting serious criminals and those who truly pose a threat to ournational security. This focus isn't about being liberal or conservative but is a smart and humane approach to enforcement of ourimmigration laws.  General Kelly will have to grapple with the realities of our immigration system. As Secretary of HomelandSecurity, General Kelly will be tasked with the critical duty of maintaining our southwest borders. We have heard[[Page S353]]promisesby the President-elect to build a wall that would cost taxpayers $25 billion; yet a wall will not secure the border or stop theflow of illegal drugs into the country. General Kelly himself noted that a wall alone is not enough. I hope that General Kellywill recognize that $25 billion is better spent trying to reduce factors that drive people to the United  Afterspeaking to General Kelly and listening to his testimony, I am cautiously optimistic that this is a nominee who understands theissues that will be in front of a Homeland Security Ultimately, to truly understand the issues, General Kelly willneed an ongoing dialog with those such as myself who care deeply about fixing our immigration system. As my colleagues areaware, my record of standing up for immigrants is clear from years of work on comprehensive immigration reform. General Kellyshould hear the stories about those with loved ones who have been torn from their homes and sent back to a country they nolonger have a connection with. He should talk to those young immigrants who are American in every way except for a piece ofpaper who have come out of the shadows, registered with the government, and applied for DACA and fear being deported under thisnew administration. He should hear from parents who have U.citizen children and have lived in this country for over a decadeand live with the constant threat of being separated from their children.  I will support the nomination of General Kelly tobe the Secretary of Homeland However, I plan on using every procedural and legislative tool to push back against anydeportation force or policies that indiscriminately separate families, targets DREAMers, and generate fear in our immigrantcommunities.

My concerns--and they will be in my full statement about Mr.Pompeo--are his suggestions in the past ofsweeping authority for the government to collect bulk information on all Americans; that is, every American in this room, everyAmerican in this city, and every American in this country. We have strong bipartisan legislation that we have worked for yearson, trying to[[Page S354]]get Republicans and Democrats across the political spectrum to set into law what the rules should be.

The challenges they face range from state-sponsored information warfare to countering violent extremists around the world.

But Congress outright rejected the bulkcollection of Americans' records when it passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 on an overwhelming bipartisan basis--the very programthat Congressman Pompeo said that he wants to bring back.  During his testimony last week, Congressman Pompeoattempted to diffuse this and other questions about his more alarming positions by affirming his appreciation of the supremacyof law.

If he does, I certainly would be willing to yield to him, and I hope I won't lose my right to the floor.  Mr.President, a lot has happened here in Washington in the last few days. Marcelle and I knew that a number of Vermonters were coming down for the Women's March on We said to them, ``Look, if any Vermonters are coming down, why don't you join us for coffee?'' We arranged it right here on Capitol Hill, so they could.  At first, we didn't know how many would show up until we started getting the responses. Marcelle and I were there, along with members of my staff, shortly after 6 in the morning, and people started pouring in. Eventually, we had 500 or 600 from the little State of Vermont who joined us. I had a chance to speak to them.  My wife, Marcelle, gave one of the most powerful speeches, totally ad-libbed, that I have heard, pointing out the stakes of what is happening in this country. Of course, she pointed to the Supreme Court just next door.  What got me is that these people came from all walks of life in Some I knew, and a lot I didn't. Some are Some are Some are All were very concerned. Most came down in buses and drove all through the night, a little over 500 miles, to show that our brave little State says no to hate. We had thousands more who marched in my State capital, Let me put this in perspective. Our State capital--I was born there, and I know it very well--is home to only 8,500 people, but 15,000 Vermonters stood on our statehouse lawn to show the President that they are paying attention, they want their voices to be heard, and the American people will hold him accountable.  I got some of the most enthusiastic emails and tweets. My 14-year-old granddaughter, Francesca, told me how thrilled she was to be there. One Vermonter who took part in the enormous Women's March in Montpelier told a member of my staff, ``This is the first time I have been able to smile since Election Day.''  In Washington, Marcelle and I were proud to march with our daughter, Alicia, and 12-year-old granddaughter, I was proud to see this 12-year-old holding her head high, knowing the respect that was being shown to her and her mother, as well as to Marcelle and me. She knew that respect went to her in a way that reflected everybody--Black, White, no matter what you might be. People cared.  We have heard disrespectful, offensive and dangerous comments seep into[[Page S419]]our national discourse. The millions of men and women who participated in marches across the country this weekend offered a powerful statement that they will not tolerate policies that restrict the rights of women or treat women like second-class citizens. They will not treat my wife as one, they will not treat my daughter as one, they will not treat my three wonderful granddaughters as one, and all five of our grandchildren will be treated the same.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration ignored the voices of millions of Americans and is already undermining the rights of women. Two of the President's first Executive Orders targeted women. His first Executive Order attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which throws into limbo the health insurance arrangements of millions of American women who have been guaranteed maternity coverage as part of their health care plans, who have been able to have affordable birth control for the first time, who have been able to tell insurance companies that no, pregnancy is not a preexisting condition. In other words, women can be treated the same as men when they seek insurance.  President Trump also reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy, a policy that would be illegal and unconstitutional in this country--that will only result in more abortions and more pregnancy related deaths in developing countries. A former Republican Senator whom I respected highly, when he was chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee--he was strongly against abortion, but he said this kind of a policy is only going to result in more abortions and more pregnancy-related deaths in developing countries, and he is right. He is right. Affordable health care, affordable birth control, and the availability of these services would bring down abortion and pregnancy-related deaths, whether in the United States or the countries we help.  Mr.President, Americans are watching. From what I heard and saw from Vermonters on Saturday, I could tell you that they are fired up and ready to go. We need a President who is committed to equality and opportunity for all people, no matter their sex, gender, or race. We will not stand for policies that turn back the clock on so much progress we have made. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, we have to accept finite disappointment, but we must not give up infinite hope. Only light can crowd out the darkness.  I was proud to see so many Vermonters speaking up. They are not going away, and, as I pledged to them on Saturday, I am not going away. I am going to speak. I am going to speak the same way I did when Marcelle and I walked with our daughter and our granddaughter in the million women march.

I know, I was there. I was the Democrat on the committee in the There was no broadband--not one home in America had broadband in 1996. Can I say that again? Not one home in America in 1996 had broadband.  Today, for a 12-year-old, a 50-inch screen plugged into broadband, that is a constitutional right. It didn't exist in 1996 anywhere. Was it because it hadn't been invented, that people hadn't thought through broadband, they hadn't thought through what was possible? It was because these companies decided, because they were pretty much all monopolies, that they weren't going to deploy it. So we had to change the rules in order to unleash this revolution.  Now they are saying: Yes, but a light touch says no privacy protections. That would be bad. People don't really want privacy protections. That is not how I remember it when I was growing up.  When I was growing up, when the salesman knocked on the front door, you know what my mother would say? Don't answer the front door. We don't want the salesman in our living room. That is what my mom said. Now, is it different today? Is everyone saying: Yes, come on in. Come into the kitchen. Come into the living room. Come into the bedroom. Come look at the kids who are sick. Come look at Grandma who is sick. We want you to see our house. We want you to know everything about us, Mr. Now the broadband provider knocks on the front door. The broadband provider says: I want to provide this great new service with a light touch. Let us go into the key rooms into your house--in your living room, in your bedroom--let us put in this broadband technology, but we are also going to gather all this information about every member of your family--your mother, your father, your children--and we are just going to gather it all, and then we are going to sell it to anybody we feel like selling it to.  Let me ask you this. Have the values of the American people changed in one generation or are they the same? Do people want total strangers to know everything about you, and you have no right to say no? None? Because that is what this debate is about tonight, ladies and gentlemen. It is all about whether the Republicans are going to take away the rights of people to protect their children, to protect their families from having all of this information which the broadband providers encourage people to put online to be then sold as a product. Did you go to a healthcare website to find out something about a disease a child in your family has? Well, that is now a product to be sold. There are plenty of insurance companies that would love to know all the people who have gone to that website to find out about that disease. Do you really want that? That is what this debate is all about. How much privacy are people entitled to in this country?  Are we going to give it to the broadband companies to determine that? That is what we are voting for tonight. They are saying: We need harmonization, meaning we need a standard which is voluntary--voluntary. The broadband companies decide what the level of privacy is. You subscribe to that company. You now have that level of privacy protection. What does that mean? That means if they don't want to provide any privacy protection, that is the standard. They are saying: Well,[[Page S1937]]that law could then be enforced because they promised you no privacy. Now, if they violate that policy in any way, we could go after them. That really is what the Republican Party thinks about the private, most intimate information that ordinary families put online because there is only one company that knows everything, and that is the broadband provider, that is Verizon, Comcast, AT&Every other one of the thousands of websites, they know what is on their websites. They don't know what is on the other websites. Only one company, your broadband provider, knows everything--has all of your information. Now what is the standard? What is the standard? The Republicans say: No standard. Don't worry about it.  Yes, the Federal Communications Commission put a new rule on the books. Yes, the Federal Communications Commission says that if they want to gather this information about your children, they have to get your permission in order to sell that information to somebody else. That is the rule right now. They gather information about your children. They have it. If they want to sell it, they have to get your permission. You have to check a box. Yes, take all of the information on my child's computer, and sell it. Sell it to people out there who want to know about my child.  That is the rule today. What they will say, as we vote tomorrow at noontime, is no more permission from the parents--none, zero, zilch.  You are on your own, kids.  Sorry, parents. The Republican Senate decided you don't keep those protections. Why? Because it is a light touch. People really do not care about privacy in the modern era. It is kind of like--privacy? Get over it. You don't have any. Get over it. Get over it, say the You don't have any privacy.  Now we are going to hear them shedding crocodile tears about all of the electronic hacking that goes on in the United But do you know that all of that combined is not even a thimble compared to the compromise of the privacy of 320 million Americans that is going to be possible after this rule is repealed tomorrow? It is the rule that gives American families the right to say: No, I don't want you gathering that information about my children. No, I don't want you to sell information about my children. That is gone. That is the vote the Republicans will cast tomorrow. The die is cast. They are all going to do it.  It is unbelievable to me that, in one generation, we have gone from people not letting the salesman into the living room to allowing one company to come in and gather every bit of information about every member of the family who is online all day long. It is amazing to me.  Do you want to know what I believe? I believe I have the same values that my grandmother had. I believe I have the same values as my mother had. I don't want anyone coming into my living room. My mother didn't want anyone coming into the living room. My grandmother didn't want anyone coming into the living room, and I am sure my great-grandmother in Ireland didn't want anyone coming into the living room to whom they did not give permission to come into the living room, especially when the kids were at home, but that is not the Republican view. The Republican view is: Oh, the big broadband barons don't like it? That is great. That is fine.  What is next? Think about it. They can get the information about when all of your family members are online, where they went, who they were talking to, who they emailed. All of it is available to the broadband company. It is just a product to be sold to the highest bidder.  Who wants this information out there? You can make billions of dollars by selling this information to other companies that would love to data mine your family so that they can profile your kids, profile grandma--profile anybody in your family--just so they can start to send in information and try to sell you stuff.  Do we really want people to be able to sell this as a product? The privacy of America is for sale. Is that what we have reached--that we are monetizing privacy?  We are saying: Hey, we are just getting in the way of the entrepreneurial spirit of Do you know what? For our whole history, we have gotten in the way of the entrepreneurial spirit of The salesman knocks on the door, and you tell the salesman: Go away. You are not getting into our living room, Mr.We don't want you in our living room.  So there are two sides to this. Yes, you want the entrepreneurial spirit to thrive, but, simultaneously, you should have a right to say: No, Mr.I don't want your product. I don't want you in my living room. I don't want you to have access to all of the information of my children. Sorry, Mr.I am sure you could have made a fortune, but the fortune comes at too high of a price.  Ultimately, the founding principles of our society are that, yes, we are capitalists, but we are capitalists with a conscience. We understand that there should be limits to how far you can go in making a buck. There should be a limitation.  What the Grand Old Party wants to do is to roll back the broadband privacy rules that give you an ability, if you want, to say yes. You can just click and say yes to all of these companies. Take all of my information. Take all of grandma's information. Take all of the kids' information. You can just check that and say yes. That is in the law. Do you want to give up all of your privacy? Push ``yes.'' Yet, under the existing law, you can also push ``no.'' I don't want to give up my privacy. It should be the consumer's choice. It shouldn't be Big Congress's and Big Government's.  Big Government is now deciding you have no privacy. The government is moving in. Replacing Big Mother and Big Father is Big Big Government is siding with Big Business and Big That is what is happening here today, and it is leaving behind Big Mother and Big Father, who care about their kids. They are taking away the authority that parents have had since the beginning of time up until now.  The broadband revolution now makes it possible to monetize privacy--to make money, to give entrepreneurs a chance through light touch regulation--which will create more jobs out there. Jobs for whom? Jobs for people who are learning about your kids, jobs for people who are learning about how to make money off of your kids, jobs for people who do not care about your kids. They care only about making a few more bucks.  How hard is this? Which business school do you have to go to to have a 3-by-5 card to figure this out? It is pretty simple, huh?  What is the job of the Senate? The job of the Senate is to ensure that we animate these technologies with human values, that we say to the inventor, to the entrepreneur: Oh, I love that whole idea of an automobile; that is fantastic. But do you know what? Why don't you build in some brakes? We are going to put up speed limits. We are going to have seatbelts. We are not going to allow you just to put it out on the road and just endanger the public or the passengers. We are going to have some rules.  It is great. Yes, invent that new medicine, but we are also going to say to you: Hey, do you know what? We are going to have a child's safety cap on top of that medicine so a kid cannot get access to it.  We balance it. We animate each new technology with the values that our parents had and that our grandparents brought from the old country. It does not change. It is always the same. The polling is 80 percent--Democrat, Republican, Independent, every ethnic group, every income group.  Do you know who does not like the rules? Entrepreneurs--entrepreneurs who want to monetize your privacy.  But it is always going to be at 80 percent, because what is, really, the differentiating issue? Why would a Republican mother want her kids to have their privacy compromised? You know that she does not. You know she does not. She doesn't even know that this debate is going on. She doesn't even know that, after they repeal this rule, it will be the Wild  So there are real rules. Again, it is the most important set of rules because it is the broadband provider. They get every bit of information. This is not just: Oh, I subscribed to this newspaper, and I am reading this newspaper. Oh, I am at Oh, I am[[Page S1938]]over here at ESPN sports. Oh, oh, oh. There are hundreds of thousands of websites, and that website knows only about what you did on that website. No, that is not what the broadband company knows. They know everything. They know everywhere you went. That is why they want this repealed. Just think of how valuable that is. Just think of how much money they can make by selling all of that information about you and your family.  That is what we are debating tonight. We are debating a fundamental change in our country. Is it a heavy touch as opposed to a light touch to say that people's privacy--that the security of their families--should be protected? Then let's just shut down these hearings we are having and all of the crocodile tears being shed about what is happening in our society.  How can all of this happen?  We go into top secret briefings. We get told: Oh, they tapped into this. They cracked into that. People--Senators--sit there, and they ``tsk, tsk'' as to how terrible it is. Then, simultaneously, up here on the Senate floor, they say: Oh, by the way, we are just going to take away the right of a mother and father to say, ``No, you cannot crack into the information that our family is putting online.'' Oh, sure. You don't want to get into the way of an entrepreneur who can figure out how to make money off of that. Why would we care about that?  The absurdity of it all--the total absurdity of it all--is that all of these people who are ``entrepreneurs'' can get fabulously rich without compromising children's privacy, grandma's privacy.  For somebody in the family who has a disease and just wants to go to that website and find out about that disease all by himself and who does not want anybody else in the family to know, why can't he do that without wondering whether everyone else who went that website is now going to have that information sold? The phone company or the cable company will say: Oh, great. Let's go find the insurance company that is in this region that would want to know that that person might have that disease. You might not want to give him insurance, especially after the Affordable Care Act is repealed by the  Who cares about that, right? You have no privacy. Get over it, say the Get over it.  Just think if we applied that to phone calls. What if people said the phone company should be able to sell the number of the person and the name of the person whom you called? How would you feel about that? Would you like that to be a product? You called this person at this time for a half an hour. Then you called that person back again another half an hour later. Then you called him again at night. Would you like people to know that--just as a product--and get the name, the number, the time, and how long the call lasted? We have laws against that.  Would you like people to know which channels you are switching to? Say you have a satellite dish and are switching from channel to channel, and at 11 o'clock at night, you are just going to stop on this channel. They know which channel you stopped on.  I passed a law back in 1999 that prohibits that information of which channel you stop on from ever being made public. You cannot sell that information. I am proud of that. Whose business is that? But it is there. They have it. They have that information.  Now we have reached a broadband revolution. Oh, isn't this great? Isn't this a fantastic revolution? Didn't it occur because there was a light touch? No, there was not a light touch. You see, we deregulated the telephone industry and the cable industry so that we could have the broadband revolution beginning in 1996.  But here is the paradox of deregulation. The paradox of deregulation is that you need more regulations in order to make sure that the competing companies can gain access to the capital markets to raise the money so as to finally put pressure on the telephone and cable companies to deploy broadband. That is the paradox of deregulation. You need more, so you open it up to more competitors who then wind up forcing these companies to finally deploy broadband even though they had it decades beforehand. Interesting, isn't it? It is the paradox of deregulation. You need more.  Even as we did that, we knew that we were going to need privacy laws because this aggregation of information is something that goes right to the heart of this kind of tension that exists in a capitalist society.  Some people say: No rules. You are interfering with my ability to make money.  That is what the car company said about airbags, and that is what the car company said about seatbelts: Do not mandate to have us put it in as it is going to undermine our product.  But, over time, mothers and fathers finally said: No, no, no. You cannot do that. I don't want the kids in the front seat with no seatbelts. I don't want people in our family in the backseat with no seatbelts.  The same thing is true with safety device after safety device. So privacy plays that role when we are talking about information.  Now, if the first step is broadband, no privacy, then, logically, they should support the whole idea that if you are on your iPhone and you have called 50 people today, it is a product. So all of those people you called should be information the telephone company can sell. What would the argument be from the other side? The other side would say, that is a light touch. That is a light touch. It is going to make it possible for the phone company to make more money. And believe me, they would make a lot of money if they could sell the information about who every American called all day long.  Well, they don't want to touch that because phones are still kind of sensitive. They don't want to go there. But broadband, that is different. Websites, that is different. For some reason, that is different because what you are doing on the website, what you are doing with your email in the modern era is what you do on your phone every day, right? It is what you do on your phone. So the goal has to be that we have the accountability for the Republicans as we do this, this evening.  President Trump is constantly railing about the fake violations of his privacy--totally fake violations of his privacy. You would think that a crime had been committed, but there wasn't. It never happened. But the way he yells about it, it is almost un-American for anyone to compromise the privacy of him or anybody else. But these are going to be very real compromises of the privacy of ordinary people in our country.  So I am just going to give to my colleagues the little Constitution that is now on the books to provide protections for all It is very simple. It requires the broadband company to, 1, get consumer consent before using or sharing subscribers' personal information--get your consent--2, promote transparency by saying to the broadband company that they have to tell each consumer that they are actually collecting this information about them. They have to constantly be telling you that. 3 is to ensure that the broadband companies adopt data security protections and notify consumers if a breach occurs; that is, if all of this information is now wide open for God knows who--some hacker who has gained information--they have to put in the toughest possible security. Then, if it does get compromised, they have to tell the consumers immediately. They can't delay a month because it might be bad PR, 2 months because they are afraid it is going to affect their bottom line. They have to let people know that their personal information has been compromised.  So that is it. That is what is bugging them. That is what is bugging the They want to make sure you don't keep these protections.  So what does that mean? Well, after we vote tomorrow, after the Republicans take these rules, these protections off the books, after the internet service providers, or the ISPs, get what they want, ISP will no longer stand for ``internet service provider.'' It is going to stand for ``information sold for profit.'' It is going to stand for ``invading subscriber privacy.'' That is what ISP will stand for after tomorrow at noontime, high noon--the end of privacy online, except for a light touch where it is voluntary. And we know these broadband companies are definitely voluntarily going to give the highest possible protections to American families. We know that. Because if they wanted the highest possible protections, they have them right now. They[[Page S1939]]want them off the books so they don't have to do anything. It will be voluntary.  So these broadband behemoths want to take control away from the subscribers and relentlessly collect and sell your sensitive information without permission. It could be about your health, about your finances, about your children. It can track your location, draw a map of where you shop, where you work, where you eat, where your children go to school, and then sell that information to data brokers.  That is going to be an incredibly profitable industry that the Republicans are opening up this week. Right now, they are drafting up their business plans, just a 3-by-5 card all across the country. They have already basically decided that the Republicans are going to have these votes; so let's get on with these new rules.  The broadband industry says that they are an unnecessary burden, but, in fact, this whole area is one that actually goes to the heart of who we are as I think that whether you are a very conservative person or a very liberal person, there should be a small core number of American values that brings us together, and I would put privacy in that group. We can fight over the Affordable Care We can fight over how many new nuclear weapons we need. We can fight over gay marriage. We can fight over many, many issues--some of them religious, some of them just strategic in terms of what is best for our country moving forward--but how can we fight over your family's privacy? I don't understand the ideological differentiation that is artificially being created by the broadband companies' insisting that the Republicans repeal those privacy laws because all of this is now going to be done without your consent, without your permission.  If they wanted to document now how many times you search online for heart disease, breast cancer, opioid addiction treatments, and then sell that information to an insurance company, they are going to be able to do that. You are giving them permission just by subscribing. And you know what they say: Oh, the marketplace will work; you can just go to the other broadband providers in town. Oh, there is no other broadband provider in town? You are in rural America? Oh, sorry, you have to use our company. Oh, there are no rules if you want to use our company--no rules.  They will say: Well, let the marketplace sort it out. What marketplace? Maximum, in most places, there are two companies you can have broadband service from, and they are both going to say privacy protection is voluntary. So there is no privacy. It is all going to happen without your consent, and they will just say: Oh, it is just so we can harmonize the rules. Yes, they are going to harmonize the rules. They are going to harmonize them so it is very efficient. You have the same nonexistent voluntary guidelines that the broadband companies are going to put on the books.  So you should want to choose, yourself, what information Verizon--if it discloses information about your family--gets to disclose. You should decide that, not You should decide that. What they really want is to allow AT&T to choose whether it protects consumers' sensitive information from breaches and unauthorized use, and guess what the broadband barons' choice is going to be? They are going to choose to pocket their profits and throw your privacy out the door.  Republicans want to sideline the Federal Communications Commission--our broadband privacy cop on the beat--and create an unregulated Wild West where internet providers can do whatever they want with your private information. They want to allow broadband companies to write their own privacy rules. That is like asking a burglar to program your security system. It makes no sense. Oh, come on in, Mr.Burglar, program my security system, and then you can do whatever you want in my living room when I am gone on vacation this weekend. Just take anything you want--any of my private information, any of my private furniture, anything you like in the house.  So we know the broadband industry--your wireless, your cable, your telecommunications provider. They can't self-regulate themselves. These same companies struggle to show up on time to install or to fix your service. You might have to wait all day to have the cable guy come and fix your cable system. They give you a range that goes like this: Well, we will be there between 9 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon; right? And now they are saying: You can trust us. We are going to protect your privacy. You know we are the cable company. You know we are the broadband company. You can trust us.  Do we really trust the broadband industry to determine what privacy protections they give to their customers? Strong broadband privacy rules mean that we don't have to do anything. That is their definition. Let's be clear. The big broadband barons want to monetize this. The subscribers have already given them money. It costs a lot of money to subscribe to broadband service so the kids can have a 50-inch screen that is plugged in to be able to see all of these things that are on the incredible multidimensional, multifunctional screens. We are already paying a fortune for it. But they say that is not enough. That is not enough. We need, say the broadband companies, to ensure that we can also make more money, and then taking all that information by invading your privacy and selling it. Broadband providers want to do more than simply provide Americans access to the internet. They want to sell that privacy information to the highest bidder.  This brings us to the great divide between ISPs and those who wish to protect the free and the open internet. The 21st century broadband internet is not a luxury. It is an essential telecommunications service, just like telephone service. Just as telephone companies cannot sell information about Americans' phone calls, an internet service provider should not be allowed to sell sensitive consumer information without affirmative consent of that family.  In fact, by putting the broadband privacy rules on the books, the FCC did harmonize privacy protections. They harmonized broadband privacy protections with the privacy framework that has prevented telephone companies from mining and selling information about our phone conversations for decades. Yes, that is what they did at the They said: the same protections for broadband information as we have for phone company information when you are dialing the numbers of people all day long. That is how they harmonized it. They said that in the 21st century, broadband is the essential service that the phone was in the 20th century, and the information on both should be given the same level of protection. That is harmonization. That is a reflection of the revolution that took place in telecommunications in the 1996 Telecommunications That is what they are trying to take off the books--the harmonization of the standards that go back to grandma and grandpa. They made sure in 1934, when the Communications Act was written, that those protections were there. But, somehow or other, in 2017, it is no longer important that people don't know whom you called, that people don't know whom you are online interacting with.  So why did they do it? Well, they did it because broadband and telephone services are essential telecommunications services that Americans rely upon to thrive in the modern economy. The Federal Communications Commission, last year, under Barack Obama, just made sure that you got the same privacy protections. Broadband and telephone companies should not be allowed to exploit their privileged positions as telecom gatekeepers to use, to share, to sell sensitive information about Americans' online activities or phone calls. Yet, here we are, chipping away fundamental broadband privacy protections from the American public.  Now, all of this begs the question: What other privacy protections are the Republicans now going to put on the chopping block? Do they now oppose the FCC's rules preventing telephone companies from collecting, using, and selling sensitive information about Americans' phone calls? They certainly oppose the FCC's rules for preventing broadband companies from partaking in similar interests and practices.  Now, the broadband industry will tell us that these rules are unfair because they are different from the privacy[[Page S1940]]rules for websites--Google, Why should there be different rules? Well, every person out there knows what the difference between Google and the broadband provider is. Google is one app; it is not thousands of apps. So the whole argument is fallacious from the get-go. When you use Google, you understand what your relationship is with When you use ESPN.com, you know what the relationship is with ESPN.com. But when you are using every service, now you are talking about the broadband companies. They are the only ones that know everything about you, what you are doing online, all day long, every single day. That is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, following along their supervision of the telephone industry, which they have had rules on the books to ensure that information can't be sold without your permission.  Why is this so important? It is important because in the 21st century, having broadband service is like having oxygen in your lungs. Everyone uses it. Everyone is using it all day long. Everyone's information is in the hands of these companies. People might as well stop breathing as to disconnect from their broadband provider. That is why we need strong rules--not self-regulation--to prevent the internet service providers from mining and selling our data without consent.  This is, for me, a historic fight to defend America's fundamental right to privacy. The broadband industry will say that if we don't take these rules off the books, subscribers will be confused. There will be one set of standards for the individual website and another set of standards for the entire broadband internet service provider industry. Frankly, consumers are only more confused about why we aren't doing more to tackle these important privacy issues. Consumers are confused about why we are spending time on the Senate floor taking away privacy protections. Consumers are confused about why we would allow broadband companies to sell their sensitive information to banks, to insurance companies, to advertisers, to anyone else willing to pay top dollar for your personal information without your consent. They are confused about why we would rescind the rules ensuring broadband providers adhere to the best data security practices protecting subscribers' sensitive information from breaches and unauthorized use, when we know there are unauthorized hacks every single day. We are in a historic fight to defend America's fundamental right to privacy online, a fight to allow consumers, innovators, entrepreneurs, the millions of Americans all across this country who rely upon the internet to control their own information.  Instead of protecting our healthcare, instead of protecting our environment and protecting our privacy, Republicans want to give it all away to their friends and allies and big corporations. Those corporations don't care about consumer rights. They have one concern, and one concern only, and that is their bottom line. That is making money.  The cornerstone of our country is capitalism with a conscience--with a conscience. Massachusetts' unemployment rate is 3.2 percent. We are proud of that. We are a capitalist Massachusetts is proud to have one of the lowest unemployment rates in our country. We believe in capitalism, but we also believe we can have capitalism with a conscience. In this instance, it means the protection of the privacy of people online, from having that family's sacred, secret information compromised for a profit, with no ability--no ability, no right, none--for a family to say no. Take the broadband service or leave it. If you take it, you have no privacy.  The only people in this country who can protect those families are 100 Senators who will be voting tomorrow. I ask the Republican Senators, why would they strip this privacy protection from ordinary families? Why would they deny the right? All I can say is, overnight, all we can really say is we tried. We really tried to protect the privacy of That vote tomorrow will represent that showdown moment.  If we lose, please, out of good conscience, Republicans, just stop all this public concern about the compromise, the privacy, the President, the national security apparatus in our country. Believe me, the ordinary American is going to be made far more vulnerable tomorrow than anything any Russian entity is ever going to do. It is going to be what we did to ourselves, what we allowed to happen to our own citizens at the hands of their own United States Senate that is going to be a far greater threat to every ordinary family in our country.  I urge a ``no'' vote from my fellow colleagues on the Senate floor tomorrow. This goes right to the heart of whether we understand technology, we understand the responsibility we have for the American people, to protect them from the worst aspects of it.  There is a Dickensian quality to the internet: It is the best of technologies, and it is the worst of technologies, simultaneously. This technology can enable. It can ennoble. We want that to be extracted from the internet. But it can also degrade. It can also debase. It is the job of the U.Senate to protect the American people from that aspect of the internet. Tomorrow, if the Republicans have their way, they will remove the protections of the privacy of Americans and allow for an expansion of the degrading and the debasing of the privacy that ordinary Americans are entitled to in our country.  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the opportunity to be here.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgS1935-4.txt,735,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,22.0,March
8989,topic-id,797,"Mr.Speaker, I am so proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with people like my colleague, Drew Ferguson, from  I am so proud to stand tonight with the President of the United I know that tonight Mr.Trump is speaking loudly on behalf of our healthcare bill. Mr.Trump is ready to take the fight on with us who feel like we need to move this health care forward.  I am not sure how many of you grew up without power steering in your vehicles, but if you know anything about the lack of power steering--and I think back to the tractors I drove growing up, and that tractor, you could not turn that wheel until you started the tractor moving--or if you had a Ford truck or a Dodge truck or a Chevy truck and it didn't have power steering, you couldn't turn that truck until it started moving.  Mr.Speaker, it is time to get this bill moving. We have to move health care forward. I am so tired of the rhetoric of repeal and replace. I am telling you, my constituents sent me here to fix health care. Forget the political rhetoric. I am ready to fix health care. I am ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with Republicans, with Democrats, with people down the aisle, across the aisle, and with our President to get this healthcare bill passed.  Unfortunately, ObamaCare has failed. When this first came about, I was so excited. I was hoping that this would be a healthcare bill that would work. But, unfortunately, it is true that this healthcare bill is dying very quickly.  One-third of counties across this country no longer have a provider to take care of the exchange. My own State of Kansas is down to one provider. Today, even more insurance companies are bailing. This bill is dying.

There are going to be more steps.  I have complete faith in Tom Price, our new HHS Secretary, that he will be deregulating health care, which is the most regulated business in the country right now. Give Price 60, 90 days to deregulate medicine and start encouraging competition, and we will start bending this cost curve downward.  We need to empower free markets. We need to empower States to have more local control. We are expanding healthcare savings accounts, but there are many more things we need to do. This is just the start of healthcare reform.  This is the first chapter of a new book on healthcare reform. There are many more chapters to go. I cannot wait to improve health care, to improve quality and start driving the cost curve downward.

8922,topic-id,2559,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak about legislation I have recently introduced, although it is a follow-on to legislation I pursued over a number of years.  We have now introduced in this Congress the Cuba Trade This is legislation which would lift the trade embargo to allow farmers and ranchers and small businesses and other private sector industries to freely conduct business, to sell products--agricultural products in particular--to the nation of Cuba and to its people.  Last month, I spoke about the terrific difficulties our farmers in Kansas and across the country are facing due to low commodity prices. The farm economy has fallen by nearly 50 percent since 2013, and that decline is expected to continue in 2017, making this perhaps, if not the worst, certainly one of the worst economic downturns in farm country since the Great  In 2016, harvests in our State and across much of the country were recordbreaking yields and historic in their magnitude, in fact. What that means is there are still piles of wheat, corn, and other grains all across Kansas just sitting on the ground next to the grain mill bins that are already filled to capacity. To sell this excess supply, our farmers need more markets to sell the food and fiber they produce.  Approximately 95 percent of the world's customers live outside U.borders. Markets in the United States will continue to grow, and they will evolve and will continue to meet the domestic consumer demand, providing the best, highest quality, safest food supply in the world, but in order to boost prices for American farmers, we need more markets. We need them now, we need them in the future, and we need to be able to indicate to our farmers that hope is in the works in global markets.  We have talked about the importance of trade, of exports from the United States, and particularly for the citizens of That is particularly true for an agricultural State like ours where, again, 95 percent of the consumers live someplace outside of the United Cuba is only 90 miles off our border. They offer the potential for increased exports of all sorts of products but especially Kansas wheat.  In fact, while we are introducing this legislation now, we started down this path to increase our ability to sell agriculture commodities, food, and medicine to Cuba back when I was a Member of the House of I offered an amendment then to an appropriations bill that lifted the embargo--the ability to sell; it would allow the ability to sell those foods, agricultural commodities, and medicine to Cuba for cash, up front. That bill was passed. It was controversial then. This issue of what our relationship ought to be with Cuba has always been contentious. But I remember the vote was about I think 301 to 116. A majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats said it is time to do something different with our relationship with  This was a significant step in opening up the opportunity to the products of American farmers and ranchers to that country. No longer were food, medicine, and agriculture commodities prohibited from being sold. And it worked for a little while, but unfortunately, in 2005, the Treasury Department changed the regulations, and it complicated the circumstances related to the embargo.  Cuba imports the vast majority of its food. In fact, wheat is Cuba's second largest import, second only to oil.  A point I would stress is that this is a unilateral sanction. Keep in mind that when we don't sell agricultural commodities to Cuba, somebody else does. While our unilateral trade barriers block our own farmers and ranchers from filling the market, willing sellers such as Canada, France, China, and others benefit at American farmers' expense. When we can't sell wheat that comes from a Kansas wheat field to Cuba, they are purchasing that wheat from France and Canada and other European countries. When the Presiding Officer's rice crop can't be sold to Cuba, it is not that they are not buying rice; they are buying it from Vietnam, China, or elsewhere.  It costs about $6 to $7 per ton to ship grain from the United States to It costs about $20 to $25 to ship that same grain from the European However, we lose this competitive advantage because of the regulations in place that drive up the cost of Cuban consumers dealing with the United  To understand what we are missing out on in Cuba, consider our current trade relationship with the Dominican The DR is also a nearby Caribbean nation with a population comparable to Income levels and diet are similar. Between 2013 and 2015, the Dominican Republic imported an average of $1.3 billion of U.farm products. During that same time span, Cuba imported just $262 million--over $1 billion in difference. That is right. That is $1 billion of exports that U.farmers are missing an opportunity on because of the U.trade restrictions on This example helps illustrate the substantial potential that exists for increased sale of agriculture commodities to  The Cuba Trade Act I just introduced simply seeks to amend our own country's laws so that American farmers can operate on a level playing field with the rest of the world. While boosting American exports remains the primary goal of lifting the embargo, I also think there is an opportunity for us to increase the reforms and to improve the lives of the Cuban people as well.  I have often said here on the Senate floor and on the House floor and back home in Kansas we often say: We will try something once. If it doesn't work, we might even try it again. Maybe we will try it a third or a fourth time. But after more than 50 years of trying to change the nature of the Cuban Government through this kind of action, through this embargo, many Kansans would say it is time to try something else.  The Cuban embargo was well-intentioned at the time it was enacted. Today, however, it only serves to hurt our own national interests by restricting Americans' freedom to conduct business with that country. In my view, it is time to make a change, and we ought to be able to sell wheat, rice, and other agricultural commodities from the United States for cash to This legislation would allow that at no expense to the American taxpayer.                            Kansas Wildfires  Mr.President, there is a lot to be proud about in being a We have lots of challenges in our State, and we are undergoing serious ones at the moment. For those who have noticed on the news, although it is not particularly a story here in the Nation's Capital, Kansas is ablaze. Fires are devastating acres and acres. In fact, nearly 700,000 acres of grasslands in our State have been burned. Fires have started. We have had winds for the last 3 days of 50 to 60 miles an hour, and dozens of communities and counties have been evacuated. Lots of places have been hard hit. My home county of Rooks experienced those fires. Hutchinson, a community of 50,000 people, had to evacuate 10,000 people in what we would consider in our State a pretty big place. So they have been rampant and they have been real, and there have been significant consequences to many lives in our  As people know, Kansas is an agriculture place. We raise lots of crops, but we are certainly a livestock State, and our ranchers are experiencing the significant challenges that come from loss of pasture, the death of their cattle, and the burning of their fences.  On my way over here, I was reading a couple of articles that appeared in the Kansas press that I wanted to bring to my colleagues' attention. There is nothing here that necessarily asks for any kind of government help, but it does highlight the kind of people I represent.  There is a farm in Clark The county seat is It is on the border with Eighty-five percent of the county's grassland, 85 percent of the acres in that county have been burned. This means the death of hundreds, if not thousands, of cattle in that county. That is the economic driver of the communities there. Ashland, the county seat, has a population of[[Page S1719]]about 900 or 1,000--the biggest town in the county--and its future rests in large part upon what happens in agriculture.  There are lots of great ranch families in our One of those is the The Gardiner Ranch is in Clark Their story is told a bit in today's edition of the Wichita They are known as some of the best ranchers in the country. For more than 50 years, they have provided the best Angus cattle. They have customers across the country. It is a family ranch. This is multigenerational, and three brothers now ranch together. It is not an unusual way that we do business in  In addition to the economic circumstances that agriculture presents in our State, it is one of the reasons I appreciate the opportunity to advocate on behalf of farmers and ranchers. It is one of the last few places in which sons and daughters work side by side with moms and dads, and grandparents are involved in the operation. Grandkids grow up knowing their grandparents. There is a way of life here that is important to our country. Our values, our integrity, and our character are often transmitted from one generation to the next in this circumstance because we are still able to keep the family together, working generation to generation. The Gardiners are an example of that, but there are hundreds of Kansans who exemplify this.  I would like to tell the story of Mr.Gardiner, as reported by the Wichita Mr.Gardiner said that he was slowly driving by some of his estimated 500 cattle that had died in this massive wildfire, and he complained on their behalf that they never had a chance. The fire was so fast. His ranch, as I said, is one of the most respected. The quality of the family's Angus cattle has been a source of pride and national attention for more than 50 years.  Like others, the Gardiners have endured plenty of bumps--and this is him telling their story--over five generations of ranching. The drought and dust of the 1930s was tough, he said, and there were even drier times in the 1950s. About 5 years ago, there was another drought in our State that was so devastating. He said his family lost 2,000 acres when they couldn't make a payment to the bank. Blizzards in 1992 killed a lot of cattle.  My point is that nothing is easy about this life, but there is something so special about it. The point I want to make is that people are responding to help, and I thank Kansans and others from across the country who are responding to the disasters that are occurring across our State throughout this week and into the future. This isn't expected to go away anytime soon.  Mr.Gardiner said that more hay is on the way, and the process of rebuilding fences will begin, hopefully, within a few weeks. He said he was sent word that Mennonite relief teams were coming from two Eastern States to work on his fences and to do so without pay. Truckloads of hay are already en route and rolling in. This story indicates that many of those truckloads of hay are coming from ranchers who in the past have bought livestock from the  Mr.Gardiner's veterinarian, Randall Spare, said that the Gardiners have long been known for taking exceptional care of their customers. The veterinarian says, ``Now it's their turn'' for the customers to repay them. ``The Gardiners are the cream of the crop, like their cattle. I'm not surprised so many people [from so many places] are wanting to help them.''  The reporter says that while he was talking to Mr.Gardiner for this interview, Mr.Gardiner answered his cell phone as his pickup slowly rolled across a landscape that now looked so barren. The reporter said that many of the calls were from clients who just called to send their best or to be brought up to date and to ask the Gardiners how they could help and how the Gardiners were holding up.  Mr.Gardiner said:       It's really something [special], when you hear a pause on      the other end of the line and you know it's because [the      person who called is] crying because they care that much. It      gets like that with ranching. It's like we're all family.  That is a great thing about our It is like that with We are all a family. But the fact is that his family is still alive. He tells the story of not knowing whether his brother and his wife were alive. The fire swept around them, but they found a place that avoided the fire, a wheat field where the wheat was still green and so short that the fire didn't intrude. But he stopped his truck to think a bit and, the story indicates, to sob a bit.  He watched as his brother Mark and his wife Eva disappeared behind a wall of fire as they tried to save their horses and dogs at their home. Ultimately, the house was destroyed. Mr.Gardiner, the one the reporter was talking to, said:       I had no choice but to turn around and drive away, with the      fire all around me. For a half-hour I didn't know if my      brother and his wife were dead or alive. I really didn't.  He said that then his brother and his wife and some firefighters gathered in the middle of that wheat field. It was so short and so green, it wouldn't burn. He said:       It was so smoky I didn't even know exactly where we were      at. But then a firefighter came driving by and told us      everybody made it out. That's when I knew Mark and his wife      were alive. That's when I knew everything would eventually be      all right. I am telling you, that's when you learn what's      really important.  So today I come to the Senate floor to express my gratitude for the opportunity to represent Kansans like the Gardiners, farmers and ranchers across our State but city folks, as well, who know the importance of family, who know that living or dying is an important aspect of life but that how they live is more important, and to thank those people--not just from Kansas but from across the country--who have rallied to the cause to make sure there is a future for these families and for the farming and ranching operations.  It is a great country in which we care so much for each other, and that is exemplified in this time of disaster that is occurring across my I am grateful to see these examples, and I would encourage my colleagues that we behave the way Kansas farmers and ranchers do--live life for the things that are really meaningful and make sure we take care of each other.

I want to talk about bringing parity between Americans who get their insurance coverage through their employer and those who are forced to purchase theirs on the individual market.  Currently, over 150 million Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance enjoy a tax benefit to[[Page H2076]]purchase that health insurance. However, Americans who purchase their insurance in the individual marketplace, like farmers, small-business owners, plumbers, and mechanics, do not have a similar kind of benefit. Mr.Speaker, simply put, this is just unfair.  However, the American Health Care Plan helps fix this inequity by offering a portable tax credit to help these Americans purchase the health insurance they choose. These credits are also age-adjusted so older Americans who have higher healthcare costs will also see a larger credit to assist them in purchasing that insurance.  Mr.Speaker, I can tell you, many individuals and families in Florida's Fourth Congressional District will benefit from this reform and for the first time will be on a more level playing field in purchasing their health insurance. We are fighting for basic fairness.

8973,topic-id,955,"Thank you, Mr. It is really a simple proposition and it is a scary one. As soon as this legislation is enacted, internet service providers can collect your browsing data and sell it without your permission. Right now there is a lot of conversation about who has jurisdiction, the FTC or the FCC, and who is more appropriate to govern internet privacy, whether this should be public sector or private sector, but the basic question is this for the pending legislation, Should ISPs, your internet service provider, be allowed to collect your browsing data without your permission and sell it? I think the answer for 98 percent of the public is a resounding no.  Right now there is a single Federal agency that has the authority to protect consumers and their privacy when it comes to data collected by ISPs, and that is the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, but the Republicans are proposing that the Congress strip the FCC's ability to protect your privacy, and when they succeed, the American people will lose the very few Federal protections they have when it comes to online privacy.  Think about how much of your life is on line today--banking, health, your interactions with your kids, your kids' interactions with other kids. It is incredibly personal, and it is not just confidential information in a traditional sense or in a legal sense, it is really a complete picture of everything you are. That is why this is worth fighting about. It is worth protecting. That is why the FCC made these rules--to recognize that we live so much of our lives online and that in a lot of instances we don't really feel like we have a choice about whether we are going to engage in a contract to get broadband service. That is a necessity for many of us. Consumers deserve some basic protections, not only do the Republicans want to get rid of the FCC rule that basically says an ISP cannot collect your data and sell it for commercial purposes, but they want to do it in a way that will ensure that no Federal agency, not a single one, will have jurisdiction over privacy for consumers using broadband. They are trying to take the referee off the playing field and for good.  The problem is very simple. There are actually two agencies that could have jurisdiction over privacy online, but there was a Ninth Circuit Court decision that made a ruling that removes the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission over online privacy in the broadband space. So of the two agencies, the FTC and FCC, the FTC, according to this Federal court, no longer has jurisdiction. Now it is on the FCC's[[Page S1936]]side of the house, but if we repeal the FCC rule, the way the Congressional Review Act runs is that it will prevent us from ever addressing something ``substantially similar'' again. This isn't about agreeing or disagreeing with this rule. This isn't about whether you think the FCC or FTC ought to appropriately deal with this. This isn't a question about whether you think we should exercise our prerogatives in the public or private sectors. This is about whether you think nobody should have jurisdiction over your privacy online.  So what is the solution here?  Well, we should work with private sector leaders, the FCC, and the FTC to find a comprehensive approach to privacy online. That is what this legislative body should be doing. Instead of aggressively digging into this issue on behalf of consumers, we are actually blowing up the only thing we have, which is this FCC rule. To repeat, by using the Congressional Review Act, Republicans are forever preventing the FCC from protecting your privacy if you use broadband.  I want to end by noting that 55 years ago this month, President Kennedy gave a seminal speech about consumer rights. He spoke about the march of technology, how it had outpaced old laws and regulations, and how fast that progress had occurred. He noted that in just a few decades supermarkets went from carrying 1,500 products to more than 6,000, doctors wrote 90 percent of their prescriptions for drugs that no one had even heard of 20 years before, but let's fast forward to the present day, and we have blown those numbers out of the water. The average supermarket carries 40,000 products; in 2015 alone, the FDA approved 51 new drugs; and of course we now have the internet, which in the United States grew from 148 million users to nearly 240 million in just 15 years. The next nonincremental change in technology in our lives will be the internet of things, in which we will have tens of billions of devices connected to each other and interacting with us whether we like it or not. So the march of technology goes on, but what stays the same is the bedrock principle that President Kennedy outlined; that consumers have the right to be safe, they have the right to be informed, they have the right to choose, and they have the right to be heard. Those rights are in jeopardy. The FCC took a small but important step, and now the Republicans are blowing that up.  Let me be clear. This is the single biggest step backward for online privacy in many years, and we have failed the American people when it comes to their privacy. We should be staring this problem in the face, but what we are doing tonight and tomorrow is making it worse. That is why I will vote no, and I will urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution.

In today's New York Times, this morning we learned that Judge Gorsuch's career[[Page S1811]]has been nurtured by a far-right billionaire and corporate titan, Philip Anschutz, who has gone out of his way to fund hard-right judicial causes, including the Federalist Society and the Heritage President Trump outsourced his choice of a Supreme Court nominee to these organizations, and they recommended Judge  Neil Gorsuch represented Mr.Anschutz's firm as a young lawyer. He has earned his favor and patronage ever since. It was Anschutz's top lawyer, someone who represented Anschutz here on the Hill, who lobbied for Gorsuch to get the spot on the Federal appeals court. Judge Gorsuch has been partners in an LLC with two of Anschutz's top advisers, building a vacation home together. Of course, there is no problem with that. Anyone can be partners. But it goes to show the longstanding intertwined ties between one of the leading advocates for a hard-right pro-corporate agenda, Mr.Anschutz, and Judge The long history of ties between Judge Gorsuch and Mr.Anschutz suggests a judge whose fundamental economic and judicial philosophy is favorable to the wealthy and the powerful and the far right.  Judge Gorsuch may sometimes express sympathy for the less powerful verbally, but when it comes time to rule, when the chips are down, he has far too often sided with the powerful few over everyday Americans trying get a fair shake. He has repeatedly sided with insurance companies that want to deny disability benefits to employees. In employment discrimination cases, Bloomberg found he sided with employers 66 percent of the time. In one of the few cases where he sided with an employee, it was a Republican woman who alleged she was fired for being a conservative.  On money in politics, the scourge, the poison of our political system--undisclosed dark money--Judge Gorsuch seems to be in the same company as Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense contribution limits.  Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates he prefers CEOs over citizens, executives over employees, corporations over consumers.  Later this morning, I will be meeting with people who have personally experienced the real-life implications of Judge Gorsuch's decisions: Alphonso Maddin from Michigan, a truckdriver who was fired because he left his vehicle when freezing; Patricia Caplinger from Missouri, who sued Medtronic after being injured by a medical device implanted in a non-FDA-approved manner; David Hwang and Katherine Hwang, whose late mother, Proffer Grace Hwang, sued Kansas State University after being fired following a 6-month leave for cancer and requesting to work at home because of a flu epidemic.

8947,topic-id,1367,"I appreciate the eloquent comments from the Senator from Oregon and all of his efforts to make sure we don't take away healthcare for so many people who desperately need it.  That is why I came to the floor today, because I spent the week we were back home--not last week but the week before--talking to constituents in New Hampshire and listening to what their concerns were.  What I heard was that people were deeply, deeply concerned and very upset by the efforts here to repeal the Affordable Care Act, when they didn't know what the replacement meant for them. In dozens of conversations and roundtable discussions at a townhall forum, Granite Staters shared stories of how the Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for them. I heard from people who say their lives have been saved by the law.  In fact, we can see what is at risk in the State of New Hampshire, where we have almost 600,000 Granite Staters who have preexisting conditions. We have 118,000 people who could lose coverage. We have 50,000 Granite Staters with marketplace plans who are in the exchange, 42,000 who are enrolled in Medicaid, and 31,000 who have tax credits that lower the cost of healthcare for them. If that is taken away, so many of those people have no option for getting healthcare.  What we know now, after we have finally seen the plan Republican leaders are talking about, we know those fears were well founded that they were worried they were going to lose their healthcare. What we have seen is legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would have catastrophic consequences not only for people in New Hampshire but for people across this country.  It is especially distressing that TrumpCare--as it has been introduced by the Republicans--would roll back expansion of the Medicaid Program, which has, in New Hampshire and across this country, been an indispensable tool in our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. In addition, we are seeing, as the Senator from Oregon pointed out, that TrumpCare would terminate healthcare subsidies for the middle class and for other working Americans, and it would replace those subsidies with totally inadequate tax credits--as low as $2,000, which doesn't begin to pay for healthcare coverage for an individual, much less a family. This means as many as 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage.  Even as the bill makes devastating cuts to the middle class, it gives the wealthiest Americans a new tax break worth several hundred thousand dollars per taxpayer. I think this proposed legislation is totally out of touch with the lives of millions of working Americans, people whose health and financial situation would be turned upside down by the bill.  Last week, in his response to President Trump's address to Congress, former Steve Beshear of Kentucky said something that really resonated with me. He reminded us that people who have access to healthcare thanks to ObamaCare are ``not aliens from some other planet.'' As he described, ``They are our friends and neighbors. . . . We sit on the bleachers with them on Friday night. We worship in the pews with them on Sunday morning. They're farmers, restaurant workers, part-time teachers, nurses' aides, construction workers, entrepreneurs,'' and often minimum wage workers. ``And before the Affordable Care Act, they woke up every morning and went to work, just hoping and praying they wouldn't get sick, because they knew they were just one bad diagnosis away from bankruptcy.''  To understand why people in New Hampshire are so upset and fearful about efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, we have to look again at this chart because some 120,000 Granite Staters could lose their health insurance. That is nearly 1 in every 10 people in the State of New  In particular, repeal of the Affordable Care Act would very literally have life-or-death consequences for thousands of people who are fighting opioid addiction, who have been able to access lifesaving treatment thanks to the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care  Sadly, one of the statistics we are not happy about in New Hampshire is that we have the second highest rate of per capita drug overdose deaths in the country. We trail only West The chief medical examiner in New Hampshire projects that there were 470 drug-related deaths in 2016, including a sharp increase in overdose deaths among those who were 19 years old or younger. For a small State like New Hampshire, this is a tragedy of staggering proportions, affecting not just those who overdose but their families and entire communities.  I am happy to say, in the last couple of years, we made real progress in combating this epidemic because we had the Affordable Care Act and its expansion of Medicaid, which has given thousands of Granite Staters access to lifesaving treatment. Over the past year, I had a chance to visit treatment centers all across New I met with individuals who are struggling with substance use disorders and providers who are trying to make sure they get the treatment they need.  Last month, at a center in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire, I had an amazing private meeting with more than 30 people in recovery from substance use disorders. They are putting their lives back together, hoping to reclaim their jobs, to get back with their families, and they are able to do that largely because of treatment that is made possible by the Affordable Care  One patient shared her story with me. As with so many others in treatment, her story is one of making mistakes, of falling into dependency, of struggling with all her might to escape her addiction. She is in recovery for the second time, and she said that this time for her is a life-or-death situation. She has no family support. She worries that she will be homeless when she leaves the treatment program, but she is grateful for the Affordable Care Act because it has given her one more shot at getting sober and the chance for a positive future.  At a forum in Manchester--New Hampshire's largest city--a courageous woman named Ashley Hurteau said[[Page S1728]]that access to healthcare as an enrollee in Medicaid expansion was critical to her addiction recovery. She had been arrested following the overdose death of her husband. Ashley said an understanding police officer and a drug court were key to her recovery. She added this:       I am living proof that, by giving individuals suffering      with substance use disorder access to health insurance, we,      as a society, are giving people like me the chance to be who      we really are again.  Without that access to treatment, where would Ashley be?  Several weeks ago I received a letter from Nansie Feeny, who lives in Concord, the capital of New She told me the Affordable Care Act had saved her son's life. This is what she wrote:       [My son] Benjamin went to Keene State College with the same      hopes and dreams many have when building their American      dream. While there he tried heroin. Addiction overcame him      but did not stop him from graduating. After graduation he      suffered a long road of near death existence. After a couple      of episodes where he had to be revived (fentanyl) he chose      recovery. And it was due to ObamaCare that we were able to      get him insured so he could get the proper help he needed and      [into] a suboxone program that assisted him with staying      ``clean.''       In April--  She wrote, and you could read between the lines how relieved she was--       it will be a year for Ben in his recovery. Without      ObamaCare, this would not have been possible. . . . I can't      find the words to define my gratitude to President I      believe my son would not be alive today if it were not for      this plan that provided the means he needed to get the help      he needed at the time he needed it.

He came up to me in Manchester and said: I am so worried about what is going to happen in this election because I am in recovery; I am an addict. He said: I am worried that whoever gets elected is not going to continue to make sure that I can get the treatment I need. He said: I am worried about Mr. As my colleague pointed out, Donald Trump, when he was campaigning in New Hampshire, made a lot of promises about how he was going to address the heroin and opioid epidemic, how he was going to make sure that people could get treatment, treatment at a cost they could afford.  Well, thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid and the great work by our Republican legislature and our Democratic Governor--then-Governor Hassan, who is now in the Senate--we passed a plan to make sure that people who had substance use disorders could get treatment.  Last year we had 48,000 applications submitted under the expansion of Medicaid for treatment of substance use disorders. If we pulled the plug on that Medicaid expansion so that people couldn't get that treatment, they wouldn't have anywhere to go.  That is what I heard when I was at Phoenix House in Dublin, in the western part of New Hampshire, a couple of weeks ago. I was sitting around with about 30 people in recovery, people who are hopeful for the first time in a long time because they are in treatment and they can see they can put their lives back together.  I said to them: What happens if we no longer have the Medicaid Program?  They said: We don't have any other options. We don't have treatment.  What we heard from President Trump is that he was going to introduce a healthcare plan that was going to cover more people for less money and better quality. Well, that is not what we are seeing.  The TrumpCare that was introduced in the House this week that they marked up and that is going to be coming to the Senate doesn't do that. It reduces coverage under the Medicaid It would throw thousands of people off of their treatment for substance use disorders, and there is nowhere else for them to go.  This is not an acceptable plan. This does not do what the President promised he was going to do.

That has been a huge benefit to people in New Hampshire over the last few years because they are beginning to see their costs for prescription drugs affected positively. So it will have a huge impact on seniors in New  The other issue that will have an impact not only on seniors but on everybody is what will happen to our rural hospitals. In New Hampshire, because we have a lot of rural areas in the State, we have a lot of small towns. Most of our hospitals are small and rural. They have benefitted significantly under the Affordable Care Act because they have been able to get paid for people who come to the emergency room for treatment. We have gotten a lot of people out of emergency rooms and into primary care. Most hospitals have seen about a 40-percent decline in people using emergency rooms for their healthcare. That has been a huge, important benefit to our rural hospitals that are operating on very thin margins that we need to keep open, not just because of the healthcare they provide but because of the jobs they provide. In most of our small communities, those hospitals are among the biggest employers.  There are huge impacts if we repeal the Affordable Care Act and we put in place this TrumpCare policy that doesn't cover as many people.

I speak here not only as a friend of the Baltic people and as a descendant of Lithuanian immigrants, but also as co-chair of the Baltic Caucus and chairman of the Subcommittee on  Like all my colleagues here, I am concerned about ensuring the security, integrity, and safety of nuclear projects in Europe and around the world. Here is the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, and that is where the power plant is being built.

Building a nuclear power plant is hard, especially when it is a country's first. That is why the International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended a six-step review process meant to prevent disasters like Chernobyl's and the more recent one in Fukushima, But Belarus has chosen to skip four of the six steps, including crucial steps, and ignore the people in the land of  There is a real concern that the main purpose behind the project is to grow Russian influence and power, especially over energy, in the European The President of Belarus said that the Astravets plant and another Russian plant are a fishbone in the throat of the European Union and the Baltic  Nuclear power plants in sensitive areas should be discussed within the Espoo Nearly all of Lithuania is within 186 miles of the plant, which means that, if a disaster were to strike, the land of Lithuania could be affected.

In 2016, four accidents occurred, and Belarus has failed to be upfront with Lithuania about any of them.  A 330-ton nuclear reactor shell was allegedly dropped from about 13 feet last summer. Belarus did not reveal anything about the incident until independent media reported it, and then downplayed it.  Building a nuclear power plant requires care in construction according to the most stringent standards with the utmost transparency, and for the best reasons. This plant fails on all four counts. It is in the wrong location. It has been irresponsibly handled.  Instead of transparency, we have seen stonewalling and obfuscation. Instead of making the most economic sense, this plant seems to make good geopolitical sense--and for Russia, not for  Mr.Speaker, let me be clear. No one here objects to the safe, secure design, construction, and running of a nuclear power plant. But the people of Lithuania are firmly opposed to irresponsible attitudes toward nuclear power, particularly so close to their most populous city.  This concern makes sense. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Environment and long-time observer of Eastern Europe, Mr.Speaker, I can assure you that the people of the United States have no better friend than the people of  Lithuanians have the right and the responsibility to ensure their and their children's environmental security.

8939,topic-id,818,"Mr.President, as Senator Wyden's colloquy comes to an end, I will make a few comments in addition to those of my colleagues, and I very much appreciate all of their work.  There are so many different things to talk about as it relates to how healthcare impacts people. As Senator Casey said, this is very personal; it is not political. There are a lot of politics around this, but it is very, very personal.  In Michigan, when we are talking about healthcare, in Medicaid alone we are talking about 650,000 people who have been able to get coverage now. Most of them are working in minimum wage jobs, and they now are able to get healthcare but couldn't before, as well as their children. That adds to the majority of seniors who are in nursing homes now, folks getting long-term care, folks getting help for Alzheimer's and other challenges and who are relying on Medicaid healthcare to be able to cover their costs.  I want to share a letter, as well, from Wendy, a pediatric nurse practitioner from Oakland County in We have received so many letters--I am so grateful for that--and emails.  She writes:       As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I have seen so many of      my patients benefit from the Affordable Care Physical      exams for the kids are now covered in full, with no co-pay.      This means the kids are in to see us, which means we catch      healthcare issues and early problems with growth or      development that otherwise might be undetected and left      untreated until it became a much bigger problem.  Isn't that what we all want for our children, to catch things early?       Immunizations are covered, which keeps everyone safer.      Screening tests are covered, so potential problems are caught      while they can still be managed. This better care keeps kids      healthier and happier and prevents longer term care costs.  She goes on to write:       The Medicaid expansion means even more kids are covered,      keeping not only those children healthier but keeping      everyone around them healthier. Previously, parents of      children who did not have insurance coverage would not seek      care until the children were so ill that they could not see      another option. Frequently, these children then utilized      emergency room care--  Which, by the way, is the most expensive way to treat health problems--     [it was] not only a missed opportunity for complete and      preventative healthcare but at a cost passed on to the      community.       On a much more personal level, in 2015, our granddaughter,      at age 3, was diagnosed with epilepsy related to a genetic      condition . . . which made her brain form abnormally. On top      of the epilepsy, she has developmental delays and autism, all      related to her double cortex syndrome. Although our daughter      and son-in-law are fully employed (teacher and paramedic),      she qualifies for Children's Special Health Care (under      Medicaid). This has been a huge blessing for us, and without      it our family would have been financially devastated.       We are hopeful that my granddaughter will continue to have      good seizure control and will develop to reach her full      potential, but without the care that her private insurance      and Children's Special Health Care provides, she would not      have much of a chance of getting anywhere near her potential.      I do not want to even consider how it will affect her future      if insurance companies can refuse to cover her care due to      her preexisting condition.  She concludes:       Please do not let partisan politics take precedence over      doing what is right and what is best for the health of every      U.citizen.  I know we are all getting hundreds of thousands of letters and emails and phone calls of very similar stories because healthcare is personal to each of[[Page S1724]]us--to our children, our grandchildren, our moms, and dads, and grandpas and grandmas. It is not political.  I am very grateful for my colleagues' being here today. I want to speak not only about the importance of expansion under Medicaid but also about the person who would be in charge of that very, very important set of services. That is the nomination in front of us, that of Seema Verma to be the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  This is a critical position, especially given the ongoing efforts that we are seeing right now to repeal healthcare--the Affordable Care Act--and replace it with legislation that would literally rip away coverage for millions of people and pull the thread that unravels our entire healthcare system.

I rise today to recognize the New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by the policies of the previous administration and ObamaCare's so-called reforms to our healthcare system. Patients have been hurt, doctors have been burdened, and families and taxpayers are being crushed by this terrible law, and its thousands of pages of onerous regulations.  Our most vulnerable citizens--seniors, the hardworking middle class, and veterans--are in worse shape now in upstate New York than they were before. In New York State and across the 22nd District, patients are being denied high-quality care that they deserve and need.  With higher costs, less accessible and affordable care, and mountains of red tape, this law has proven to be everything but a Patient Protection and Affordable Care Now, some deductibles are higher than a house payment, and premiums across the Nation have increased on average by 25 percent. Our families didn't sign up for this.  Patients have had their plans canceled and their doctors are deemed out of network. They have fewer and worse choices than before. All the while, costs have skyrocketed with premiums and deductibles jumping by double digits and triple digits in some cases.  This failed law has hurt our economy, small-business owners, and family farms while driving hundreds of thousands of jobs out of our communities. Small businesses are being crushed by ObamaCare and have either stopped hiring or dropped insurance coverage for their employees. The CBO estimated that ObamaCare will result in the loss of at least 2 million jobs. In fact, the number one complaint of small-business owners in my district throughout the last 6 years has been ObamaCare, and 70 percent of the new jobs are created by the small businesses in our community.  One small-business owner, in fact, told me that she had to lay off nearly a dozen employees just to keep up with the cost of Just think of looking at 12 families and saying: You have now lost the primary caregiver in your family just to keep up with ObamaCare mandates.

Another independent, self-insured man with three children told me that he had an insurance plan, but he had no[[Page H2077]]health care, with a $12,000 annual deductible.  This is unfair and it is unsustainable for small-business owners, particularly those in the independent market.  Hardworking middle class families in New York are being burdened with nearly the highest taxes in the New York is one of only four States that passes the State 50 percent share Medicaid burden onto the local taxpayers. Twenty-five percent of the State's obligation to cover Medicaid costs are forced onto struggling local governments already suffocating under unfunded mandates from the This has caused property and sales taxes to increase year after year, crushing the pocketbooks of even the most vulnerable taxpayers.  In New York State, local taxpayers throughout our 63 counties will be forced to pay over $7.5 billion annually in this local share to support New York's Medicaid program.

While it is no longer novel, this essential technology continues to transform the world around us in often very unexpected ways. Just a few short years ago, the idea of the Internet being built into farm equipment would have been unthinkable. Yet, today, wireless Internet in tractors and combines is making agriculture more and more efficient. This is just one small example of how new information technologies have become a fundamental part of our economy. There isn't a job creator in America who doesn't have a story to tell about how or when he or she realized the Internet had become a critical part of his or her business.  But while the digital economy is creating massive opportunities, our Nation's laws are not keeping pace. Over the past several years, Netflix and Amazon have completely disrupted the video world. The iPhone, which redefined personal computing and connectivity, just celebrated its 10th anniversary. Yet most of the government policies dealing with video, wireless, and Internet platforms were written for a world where none of these things existed. It is a testament to the ingenuity of American businesses and entrepreneurs that they have been able to adapt and succeed with laws that are increasingly out of date. While I don't doubt that they will continue to work around these challenges, American companies and consumers deserve better.  It is past time to modernize our communication laws to facilitate the growth of the Internet, and it is high time to update government policies to better reflect the innovations made possible by digital technologies. As the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I have committed to modernizing government policies for the digital age, and that will be one of our top priorities in the Commerce Committee this year.  One way the government can boost investment in our digital infrastructure is by finding ways to make it cheaper and easier to build broadband networks. At the Commerce Committee, I introduced legislation called the MOBILE NOW Act to ensure that huge swaths of wireless spectrum are made available for use by the year 2020. By then, we hope to see the next generation of ultra-high speed services known as 5G, which will need more spectrum than is available today. The MOBILE NOW Act will also cut through much of the bureaucratic redtape that makes it difficult to build wireless infrastructure on Federal property.  I am happy to report that the Commerce Committee passed the MOBILE NOW Act earlier today, but this legislation is just the start. The Commerce Committee will continue to develop legislative proposals to spur broadband deployment, make more spectrum available for the public, and improve connectivity throughout rural  Good Internet infrastructure policies and investments matter very little, however, if government bureaucrats can overregulate the digital world. The Federal Communications Commission has long been the main government regulator for telecommunications. As we have turned away from traditional telecom services and toward new technologies, the FCC has found its role gradually diminishing. This is inevitable and a good byproduct of technological innovation. But instead of accepting this, over the last several years the FCC has aggressively pushed for government interference in the Speaking about new economic opportunities on the Internet, the last FCC Chairman declared: ``Government[[Page S425]]is where we will work this out.'' The government is where we will work this out? Well, I believe consumers and job creators should be the ones deciding about new technologies, not the government. I think most Americans would agree.  Right now, Internet providers are offering innovative service plans that allow you to stream video, music, or other content for free. These innovative offers are a sign of strong competition in the marketplace. Yet, 2 weeks ago, the outgoing FCC issued a report raising what it called ``serious concerns'' that such practices ``likely . . . harm consumers.'' That is right, it seems the FCC thinks that being able to do more online for less money is somehow bad for consumers. Meanwhile, consumers themselves seem to strongly disagree because a lot of these free data offerings are turning out to be quite popular.  One of the most important takeaways from the last election is that people are tired of bureaucrats trying to micromanage their lives. One way we can address this concern is to see how the FCC operates and reform what it is allowed to do. The FCC should be focused on fixing fundamental problems in the marketplace, not dictating the direction of technological progress. The last time Congress passed meaningful laws affecting the FCC was when the Internet was in its infancy. It is clearly time for the FCC's reform once again.  At the Commerce Committee, we have had many conversations about improving this agency, and I believe this year presents a real opportunity to turn those conversations into solutions. I am confident that we can attract the bipartisan support that is needed to move legislation modernizing the FCC across the Senate floor.  Another area where I would like to achieve bipartisan agreement is on legislation to protect the open We need clear and reasonable rules for the digital road that everyone can understand. Complex and ambiguous regulations that shift with the political winds aren't in anyone's best interests. For Americans to get the maximum benefit from the Internet, they need certainty about what the rules are and, most importantly, what the rules will be in the coming years. The only way to achieve that is for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation. I have been working with my colleagues to find a legislative solution. While we are not there yet, I am committed to getting there.  The Commerce Committee was incredibly productive last year, with 60 measures enacted into law. We made real progress on Internet-focused legislation, including committee approval of the MOBILE NOW Act that I mentioned earlier. We will build on that foundation in this I look forward to taking advantage of the good ideas of our committee members on both sides of the aisle.  At the end of the day, it is not, as I said, Congress that is going to come up with the best solutions. It will be American innovators and entrepreneurs who will determine what the digital future holds, not us here in Washington, Government should focus on facilitating their success while making sure that we are not accidentally standing in their way.  I am excited to see how the Internet and other emerging technologies will continue to change our world in the coming years, and I am eager to do my small part to ensure that all Americans benefit from these amazing advances.

I rise today in support of H.67, the second of two resolutions the House is debating today to ensure strong protections for retirement savers.  There are two parts to the regulatory loophole we are seeking to close today. First, the Obama administration created a sweetheart deal that would allow States to deny important protections for retirement savers. Then, a second regulation was issued to extend that sweetheart deal to cover certain cities and counties.  The resolution we are debating right now would block the second regulation and ensure retirement savers in every city are afforded longstanding protections under Federal law. It would also ensure employers continue to have clear rules of the road for retirement plans.

9022,topic-id,378,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, again, I appreciate the full-throated debate that went on here in the discussion of a most important issue. I am grateful that ERISA was in place for my father, a tool and die maker, a machinist. He didn't have pensions, but he was able to, as a result of making little-by-little allocations to a retirement savings plan, set aside money to make sure that, most specifically, my mother was taken care of--and she was--as a result of protections that were put in place, requirements that were put in place, and a savings plan for retirement outside of any pension. Her basic needs were cared for until the end of her life.  So I certainly resonate with the desire to make sure middle-income, middle class families, and everyone has the opportunity for secure retirement savings. We all support creating new options for retirement savers. Unfortunately, the regulatory loophole created by the Obama administration is not the answer.  Every American, regardless of what city or State they live in, deserves strong protections and secure retirement. That is why, for over 40 years, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act has been the law of the land. Denying those longstanding protections to certain workers is a completely backwards approach that undermines the retirement security of working families, and I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want that to happen. We agree on that.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.67 to ensure workers and retirees in every city across the country continue to have the legal safeguards they need to retire with security and peace of mind.[[Page H1221]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

To put this into perspective, this tax break that the insurance companies' CEOs seem to have after two committees in the other body have acted on TrumpCare--the amount of the bonuses for the insurance company executives would be enough to cover the TrumpCare-created shortfall in Oregon's community-based services for the elderly and the disabled two or three times over.  What we are talking about is how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks are going to the fortunate few and special interests, while some of the money is coming from stealing a chunk of those dollars from the Medicare trust fund. And this is very much intertwined with the nominee's work because she would be overseeing Medicare payments to rural hospitals in places like Louisiana and  What I am going to turn to now is what TrumpCare, based on these two committees, means for rural areas. And, of course, it repeals the Medicaid expansion. It caps the Medicaid In my own view, and I know the Senator from Louisiana knows a lot about healthcare, in rural communities--and most of our towns are under 10,000 in population. I am from southeast I love southeast The only regret is I didn't get to play for the Portland Trail Most of the communities in our State are under 10,000 in population. As the Senator from Louisiana knows, we are talking about critical access facilities. We are talking about sole community hospitals. We are talking about the facilities that deal with acute care.  During the last major break over the President's holiday, I started what is going to be a yearlong effort for me, and I called it the rural healthcare listening tour. It is eye-popping to have those rural healthcare providers who in my State have worked so hard to find ways to get beyond turf and battles, to work together--the hospitals, the doctors, the community health centers, and the like. They have built an extraordinary effort that helps to wring more value out of scarce dollars. Their programs are based on quality, not on volume.  By the way, they are a huge source of economic growth and jobs for our rural communities. I spent the President's Day recess, and the next major recess as well getting out and listening to them. The verdict from Oregon's healthcare providers, who have worked very hard at being innovative, trying to make better use of what are called nontraditional services, said these kinds of cuts are not an option if you want to meet the needs of so many who have signed up as a result of the Medicaid expansion.  TrumpCare ends the Medicaid expansion, rolling back Federal matching funds in 2020. The rural hospitals in my State are frequently the only healthcare provider available for hundreds of miles. The Medicaid expansion helped these hospitals keep their doors open.  I don't think it is hard to calculate why the hospitals are speaking out against the flood approach of They have a lot of facilities in rural areas that are already on tight margins. If these communities lose the ability to cover needy people, some of the essential hospitals--and I just described three types of them--are going to have to close, and the reality is going to be that patients aren't going to have any doctor anywhere nearby.  Understand, if the majority insists on ramrodding TrumpCare through--and at this point we have, I believe--staff just told me that there aren't any budget estimates. As of now, the Congressional Budget Office is tasked with providing accurate assessments of the budget implications. There are not any budget implications.  So here is the latest. It comes from media that I think is not considered by many Trump supporters to be a purveyor of fake news. This comes from FOX They said: Unknown in the new healthcare plan, unknown in TrumpCare--the cost. How many lose or gain insurance?  I am very pleased that my colleague from New Hampshire has come to join me because some of this, I would say to my friend from New Hampshire, leaves you incredulous because this comes from FOX FOX News is hardly a source for what many Trump supporters would consider fake news. FOX News is asking the question because they are saying it is unknown. It is unknown in the new healthcare plan, Senator Shaheen, according to FOX The cost is unknown, and how many lose or gain insurance is unknown.  I would say to my colleagues, because my friend from Louisiana has joined the Finance Committee, and I remember welcoming him and Senator McCaskill, our new members. My colleague from Louisiana is a physician and is very knowledgeable about these issues. I don't know how you have a real healthcare debate in America--and I have been working on this since I was director of the Gray Panthers at home back in the days when I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks. When we would start a debate, nobody would consider starting it without having an idea of costs or how many lose or gain insurance. How much more basic, I say to Senator Shaheen, does it get than that? Are these ``gotcha'' questions? Are these alternative facts? Are these people who are hostile to conservatives? I think not. FOX News--unknown in the new healthcare plan.  I have been outlining what this means in terms of the transfer of wealth from working families in New Hampshire and Oregon to the most fortunate in our country--people who make $250,000 or more. They are actually going to be the only people in America who get their Medicare tax cut. So you have this enormous transfer of wealth, what I call the reverse Robin Hood: taking from the working people and giving to the fortunate few.  After two committees have now acted in the other body--two committees have acted--FOX News says the big questions are outstanding. The Senator from New Hampshire knows a lot about rural healthcare. I was just outlining to my colleagues what this means for critical access hospitals, sole community hospitals, acute care facilities. These are the centerpieces of many rural communities, the essence of rural life. You can't have rural life without rural healthcare.  Here we are on Thursday afternoon--with many of our colleagues out there tackling jet exhaust fumes heading home--and the big questions, according to FOX News, are outstanding.  I am very pleased the Senator is here. As usual, she is very prompt and appreciated.  I look forward to her remarks.

8945,topic-id,116,"My colleague is making a very important point. I think we all know the Senate budget process is a lot of complicated lingo. People in the coffee shops in New Hampshire and Oregon don't follow all the fine points of reconciliation.  As the Senator has just said, what they are using is a process that is known as reconciliation. That is the most partisan process you can come up with. There is no more partisan kind of process, and we were talking about the tally. As of this afternoon, two committees in the House have acted.  The Senator from New Hampshire just mentioned, I think, there were 11 Republican amendments in just one of the committees.

As my colleague knows, I don't take a backseat to anybody in terms of bipartisan approaches in healthcare. I have worked with Republicans--Chairman Hatch, chronic care. Senator Bennet and I worked on a bill with eight Democrats and eight I appreciate your making this point.  As of this afternoon, as far as I can tell, no Democratic amendment has been adopted. You highlighted 11 Republican amendments getting adopted in just one committee. As we indicated, FOX News--not exactly hostile to some of the ideas being advanced by the majority--has certainly called them out on this.

8950,topic-id,348,"I thank her for her presentation. It was factual and very specific, and I think it really highlighted so many of the concerns that we have at this point.  I want to see if I could get this straight on the opioid issue. Here you all are in New Hampshire, right in the center of the Presidential campaign. All of the candidates are coming through, and they are practically trying to outdo each other in terms of their pledges to deal with this wrecking ball that is the opioid addiction that has swept through New Hampshire[[Page S1729]]and, of course, my own home State as well.  I remember then-Candidate Trump being particularly strong and assertive about how he was going to fight opioids.  I think what my colleague said--and I am curious, so I am going to ask a couple of questions because I don't think folks even in my home State are aware of some of these things. So I am going to ask my colleague about it.  Are folks in New Hampshire aware at this point--my colleague put up that Trump chart, showing how the people didn't know what was being cut and how much it was going to cost and all the rest. Are people in New Hampshire at this point aware of the fact that this is essentially after a campaign in their home State, which certainly put out a lot of TV commercials and campaign rhetoric in the fight on opioids?  I think my colleague said that when people unpack this, they are going to see that this is a major broken promise, that TrumpCare is a major broken promise on opioids because, in terms of the time sequence, they all had debates and commercials, then we finally got some money in order to have treatment.  And I think what my colleague said is that now, as a result of TrumpCare and the cap on Medicaid, there will not be the funds to get the treatment to people who are so needy. Is that what this is going to be about in New Hampshire?  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1714.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,March
8952,topic-id,458,"I think my colleague's point is well taken.  As we have been saying, this is very much intertwined with the Seema Verma nomination because what we learned in the committee is, in Indiana, where she touts her pioneering work, if somebody had an inability to pay for a short period of time, they would be locked out of the program. So in terms of Medicaid, this is going to cause a real hardship.  I had already outlined that it is going to cause a hardship in another program that is important to New Hampshire, and that is Medicare, because we are implementing what is called the MACRA, the new reimbursement system for doctors. We asked her questions about rural care, and she didn't know the answer either.  I particularly wanted my colleague to walk us through this situation with respect to how New Hampshire residents are going to see TrumpCare as it relates to opioid addiction after they have all these grandiose promises and the many debates and commercials.  I thought I would ask if my colleague has time for one other question.  In New Hampshire, as in Oregon, we have a lot of seniors. It looks to me as if somebody who is, say, 58 years old or 62 years old is just going to get hammered by what we call the age tax because in these bills, which are now moving like a freight train with the House already moving in two committees, Republicans want to give insurance companies a green light to charge older people five times as much as they charge younger people. So I cited a number of my small, rural counties--Grant County, Union County, Lake County--and how a 60-year-old who makes $30,000 a year can see their insurance costs, because of the age tax, go up something like $8,000 a year.  I don't have the numbers as of now--Finance staff is still working on that for every single State--but obviously that tax sure looks like it is going to hit somebody in New Hampshire, an older person, people before they are eligible for Medicare, and particularly in that 55-to-65 bracket. It looks like it is going to hit them very hard. How is that going to be received, because in my time in New Hampshire, we talked about it, and a lot of those people really are walking on economic tightropes. They are balancing their food bill against their fuel bill and their fuel bill against their rent bill. I know my colleague spends a lot of time trying to advocate for them, help them through small business approaches. How are they going to be able to absorb what is clearly going to be thousands of dollars in new out-of-pocket health costs?

8954,topic-id,98,"I thank my colleague.  We have heard Republicans say repeatedly that anything they are going to do with Medicare is not going to hurt today's enrollees or people nearing retirement. The fact is, TrumpCare hurts both. It is going to shorten the life expectancy of the Medicare trust fund, and those older people--I will be curious, when my colleague returns--I will be very interested to hear what seniors in New Hampshire who are 56 to 68 and are walking on that economic tightrope are going to say.  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for the excellent presentation.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1714.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,March
8956,topic-id,765,"I thank my colleague, and we are going to prosecute this cause together.  I see that the chairman of the Finance Committee has arrived. He graciously said I could take another 5 minutes or so of our time.  Before we wrap up this part of our presentation, I want to point out that we have outlined how people who are dealing with the consequences of opioid addiction would be hurt by We have outlined how seniors who are not yet eligible for Medicare are going to be hurt and how seniors who are now on Medicare are going to certainly be hurt by reducing access to nursing home benefits. Now I would like to wrap up by going to the other end of the age spectrum and talk for a moment about children.  Nearly half of Medicaid recipients are kids, and the program of the Republicans--now that we have two committees in effect out of chute with their proposals--restructures the program in the most arbitrary way, using these caps, shifting costs to And the reality is that Medicaid is a major source of help for children. There is early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment benefits. But with reduced funding, the States are going to be forced to make difficult decisions about which benefits they can keep providing. States are going to be forced to reduce payments to providers, particularly for kids, providers such as pediatric specialists, and limit access to lifesaving specialty care.  My own sense is that this is shortsighted at best, and it is like throwing the evidence about children and their health needs in the trash can. Children receiving Medicaid benefits are more likely to perform better in school, miss fewer days of school, and pursue higher education.  Before I yield the floor to my good friend and colleague Chairman Hatch, I want to come back to what disturbs me the most about all of this. All of these dramatic changes to Medicare and Medicaid that strip seniors and some of our most vulnerable citizens are being made at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars to these programs while, in effect, there is an enormous transfer of wealth given to the most fortunate in America in the two bills that were passed by the other body today in the committee. In effect, for example, people who make over $250,000 will not have to make the additional payments under the Medicare tax. If ever there were a group of people in America who doesn't need additional tax relief, it is those people.  As we wrap up this portion of the presentation, I want people to just think about looking at their paycheck. Every time you get a paycheck in America, there is a line for Medicare tax. Everybody pays it. It is particularly important right now because 10,000 people will be turning 65 every day for years and years to come.  What the tax provisions of this legislation mean--and they are part of hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts--for insurance executives making over $500,000 annually, there are yet additional juicy writeoffs, while seniors and those of modest means are going to bear the brunt of those reductions. Nothing illustrates it more than cutting the Medicare tax, colleagues.  I don't know how anyone can go home in any part of the country and say: You know, we are going to have to charge older people between 50 and 65 a lot more for their coverage, and by the way, insurance company executives making $500,000 a year are going to get more tax relief. I don't think it passes the smell test in It is reverse Robin There is no other way to describe it. It is transferring wealth from working families and those who are the most vulnerable. When working Americans see their paycheck and see the Medicare tax, I hope they remember that in this bill, the Medicare tax is reduced for only one group of people--people making more than $250,000 a year.  I want tax reform. The chairman of the Finance Committee knows that. I have introduced proposals to do that. But I don't know how we get tax reform when they are giving the relief to the people at the top of the economic ladder and it is coming out of the pockets of working people and working families. Everybody is going to be able to see it right on their paycheck, right there with the Medicare tax.
