                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Creator and Redeemer, cleanse us from anything that hinders the 
knowing and doing of Your will. Give our lawmakers clean hands and pure 
hearts which will fit them to serve You and all people. Liberate them 
from forces that keep them from moving toward consensus. As they seek 
to bring unity to our Nation and world, teach them how to best serve 
the common welfare, to assure personal freedoms, and to fulfill the 
purposes of Your Kingdom. Lord, bless them beyond their expectations.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
