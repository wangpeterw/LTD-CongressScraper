                     RECOGNIZING KARLA-SUE MARRIOTT

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Karla-
Sue Marriott, associate professor of chemistry and forensic science at 
Savannah State University.
  Dr. Marriott has made groundbreaking chemical discoveries to help 
millions of people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS. Dr. Marriott 
began her work at Savannah State in 2006, after completing a 
postdoctoral fellowship at Clemson University.
  In 2010, while at Savannah State, she applied for a grant with the 
National Institutes of Health, which allowed her to research dopamine 
and sigma receptors in the brain. It was through this research that Dr. 
Marriott discovered the chemical compound called benzofuran.
  Benzofuran has the ability to target and activate signal receptors in 
the brain, while leaving other central nervous system receptors alone. 
This has the potential to reduce the impact of various neurological 
diseases.
  However, Dr. Marriott's work is not done. She will continue her 
research to discover the full potential of her compound and the 
benefits it can provide.
  I am proud to recognize Dr. Marriott today, and I am thankful for the 
work she is doing at Savannah State University.
