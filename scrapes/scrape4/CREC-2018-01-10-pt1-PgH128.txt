  SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE AUTHORS OF THE INFAMOUS DOSSIER EXPOSING 
                       TRUMP'S RUSSIA CONNECTIONS

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, character assassination is Donald Trump's 
favorite trick when people make him look bad. This month, Trump and his 
allies have been desperately smearing the authors of the infamous 
dossier, which exposes disturbing facts about Trump's Russia 
connections. By attacking Chris Steele and Fusion GPS, they are trying 
to divert attention from the damning content of the dossier and also to 
impugn the FBI for launching its investigation.
  Here is the problem: the dossier didn't start the FBI investigation. 
It was a Trump policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, boasting to an 
Australian diplomat that Russia had stolen emails to interfere in our 
election. That was 2 months before those stolen emails were put online, 
and that smacks of collusion.
  Thankfully, our Australian allies shared this information with the 
FBI and the investigation began. The dossier came along and 
corroborated what the FBI had already heard.
  There is another problem with this smear campaign: It wasn't just the 
FBI that took the dossier seriously. Senator John McCain deemed it 
credible enough to turn it over to the FBI.
  This is a serious document, corroborated by a host of other evidence, 
and the truth is coming out, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Faso). Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President.
