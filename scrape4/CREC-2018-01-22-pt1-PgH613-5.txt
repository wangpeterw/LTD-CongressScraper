                     SENATE SHOULD END THE SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, let's set the record straight. Yesterday, 
Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said that part of the reason for the 
shutdown is that this is the fourth CR this term.
  Why do we have CRs--continuing resolutions?
  Well, when Congress doesn't pass appropriations, a CR is the only 
choice other than a shutdown.
  The House of Representatives passed all of our appropriations bills 
for this year. Senate Democrats have deliberately impeded the 
legislative process in the Senate, and no appropriations bills have 
been passed in their Chamber this term. When Senate Democrats leave no 
choice but a CR, don't complain about a CR.
  Mr. Speaker, this is no way to run a government. Recognizing the 
damage that occurs with a shutdown, the House again rose to the 
occasion and passed a continuing resolution with content that both 
sides agree with. The House of Representatives has done their job. We 
want to keep our government open. If only Senate Democrats would end 
this Schumer-led shutdown.
