                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at 
the desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 1) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to 
     titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget 
     for fiscal year 2018.

  Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.
